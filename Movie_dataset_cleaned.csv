0,1,A suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues.
1,1,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career."
2,1,"An intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted biopicture about the kinds of events that are hard on the heart."
3,1,"With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous."
4,1,"In a movie about impending global catastrophe, he gives a close-up of a face, and a twitch of a lip the power of an atom bomb."
5,1,Oppenheimer is the most important story of our time.
6,1,"What he [Nolan] has put before our eyes definitively deserves to be seen, as does Cillian Murphy's performance in the role of Oppenheimer and the irreconcilable but fantastic Robert Downey Jr. in the role of Lewis Strauss. [Full review in Spanish]"
7,0,"His latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance..."
8,1,A cinematographic marvel by all measures. [Full review in Spanish]
9,1,"The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come."
10,1,"Oppenheimer is mythic, massive, and a masterful work from Christopher Nolan. Murphy & Downey Jr. deliver career best performances in what is the most important movie of the decade."
11,1,Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can’t resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives.
12,1,"[Christopher Nolan's] most stirring plea to humanity yet. A three-hour drama that plays like a terse thriller, weaving Nolan’s deep-seated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures."
13,1,"Armed with a haunting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan gives us his most personal and political film yet, that is fascinating as it is flawed."
14,1,"Oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying, dizzying and bloated, a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of Nolan’s best and most political works to date."
15,1,"The true test of 'Oppenheimer' is whether Nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms. Like his protagonist, he succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion."
16,1,"Though the entire ensemble operates as a well-oiled machine, it feels like distracting stunt casting at times."
17,1,"A cinematographic masterpiece... of the highest level, as well as an organized sensorial experience that gives us back a historical event that is relevant in the present and also transcendental. [Full review in Spanish]"
18,1,"After three hours of viewing, you will understand Oppenheimer's  drive for success--I can highly recommend the film as you’ll learn a wealth of information while being artfully entertained."
19,1,"Oppenheimer is a long film, but it never causes a sense of ennui. The subjects are both intriguing and terrifying as Nolan warns against nuclear possibilities and character assassination."
20,1,"It is a noble try, an interesting experience, and an absolutely fascinating example of the director as superstar."
21,1,"It is the most exhilarating and harrowing story about scientists I’ve seen in a minute, with a cast of staggering renown bringing the story to life."
22,1,"With human paradoxes at its nucleus, this is a riveting portrait, both intimate and epic, of the self-involved men who think they make the world go round... and too often, tragically, do."
23,1,"Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job with his portrayal of Dr. Oppenheimer! Not only did he resemble Dr. Oppenheimer, he was able to capture all of the fear and torment with his facial expression alone! Christopher Nolan truly brought filmmaking up a notch!"
24,1,"""Oppenheimer"" is a stunner and one more way director Christopher Nolan reminds us cinema is a vital art form, not a disposable one."
25,0,"I find the last third of this movie to be interesting, and the first two-thirds to be long and, at times, not understandable."
26,1,"It's a huge film, designed to be watched in IMAX (as I did) but it's actually a very intimate tale: arguably the first character study that Nolan has ever done."
27,1,"The three-hour running time and scientific jargon demand patience, but Nolan's marriage of visuals and sound design is often dazzling, not least during the tension-filled detonation of the prototype device."
28,1,"Thankfully, despite my qualms with Nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief he's finally told a straightforward story, I was still completely taken by its gravitas. Give Murphy and Downey Jr. Oscars."
29,1,"The way the director approaches Oppenheimer's fears and his internal struggles with surrealistic images is the most admirable aspect of the film, and leaved us wanting to see more about it. [Full review in Spanish]"
30,1,OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. An engrossing epic that brings you inside the tortured mind of a man driven to change the world. Cillian Murphy is quietly stunning as the consumed Oppenheimer and RDJ delivers an Oscar worthy performance.
31,1,"This is very clear, effective, disciplined prestige filmmaking, enough to make this one of the toniest pieces of Oscarbait that I expect to see this year - but it is Oscarbait."
32,1,"Nolan refrains from passing judgment on Oppenheimer – leaving that to us, if we so choose – suggesting instead that it’s within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy."
33,1,"The supporting cast are astonishing, particularly Downey Jr, who is on career best form as Strauss – his Best Supporting Actor nomination is surely already in the bag."
34,1,"This movie resembles a nightmare that torments not only the protagonist, but all of humanity. A horror that still lives and that finds a perfect representation in Cillian Murphy's haunted eyes. [Full review in Portuguese]"
35,1,"An intellectual thriller that is a masterpiece of image and word, of complex ideas made manifest, and all kept at a very human level to maintain constant immediacy."
36,1,"One of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that Nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects’ contradictions. If anything, he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable. Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?"
37,1,"The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy."
38,0,...a technically-impressive yet mostly underwhelming drama...
39,1,"As emotional, beautiful, and thought-provoking as this film is, it’s that much more powerful because it’s based on historical events. It’s a film I won’t be able to shake for a long time."
40,1,"Rarely have I left a movie feeling smarter than when I went in, but “Oppenheimer” is just such a film and it elevated my thinking, especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science."
41,1,"The film’s sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy, but more often than not, Nolan’s filmmaking soars."
42,1,"The film’s speed – necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study – is a bit like a trick in itself, both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that Oppenheimer himself rarely did."
43,1,"Nolan and his entire crafts team have made something extraordinary. If the question is can a movie about a historical event be thrilling and suspenseful, Oppenheimer makes the answer a resounding ""yes."""
44,1,"A majestic, mournful entertainment that’s as serious as a heart attack, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s bullseye shot at Grand Statement cinema that’s about nothing less than human annihilation."
45,1,"This is a big, mammoth movie, boasting a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy, a whip-smart script, and other technical marvels. Jennifer Lame's editing is particularly remarkable."
46,1,"Fortunately, it’s not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This film is one of Nolan’s best and searingly simple-yet-complicated works."
47,1,"A studious examination of history, shown via a reverent lens of Hollywood spectacle, Oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be Christopher Nolan’s best picture yet."
48,1,"This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling -- and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it."
49,1,"If Dunkirk, [Christopher Nolan's] 2017 film about the historic World War II battle, was his bid to prove that he’s a “serious filmmaker”, then Oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema."
50,1,"Every scene feels like a cataclysm waiting to happen, fitting for a film that builds, step-by-step, to the creation of a cataclysm machine. Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought."
51,1,"A messy, sprawling, operatic statement from Nolan. It’s technically masterful, but can also keep you at a distance during crucial moments. But it’s also incredibly exciting to behold, a mosaic of intellectual cinema drenched onto the screen."
52,1,"On one side it’s an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter, but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments. It all came up more informative than fun."
53,1,"In a year that has given us several great films, this one shines above the rest and is the strongest contender for the Oscar so far in 2023."
54,1,"As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat."
55,0,"At three hours, Oppenheimer as a whole falls short of the sum of its pleasing parts."
56,0,"There’s one element worthy of unreserved praise here, and that’s Robert Downey Jr.’s welcome-home performance — his comeback, if you will, from his comeback, which kidnapped him into Marvel movies for eleven years"
57,1,"So much of our lives is about the fear and fearlessness around turning theory into action, at all levels of our lives. Oppenheimer is a run with those bulls, fearless and relentless."
58,1,"Despite a few minor problems, Nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power. It may take some time but eventually Nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity."
59,1,"Oppenheimer is on the cusp of changing the world, mostly for the worst, but barely focuses on the moral quandary of this. All the Nolan beats but were missing the snarky Sorkin dialogue of A Few Good Men and smooth Tarantino style of Inglourious Basterds."
60,1,"[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch."
61,1,"If it does nothing else, this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war, and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago."
62,1,"Oppenheimer leaves you in tatters as it is a gripping piece on a man consumed by guilt and inner turmoil. “A man who became death, the destroyer of worlds.” You won't forget this film for a long time."
63,0,This film is a White-Jewish male compartmentalized view of history that blinds us to the truth of the world that J. Robert Oppenheimer worked in.
64,1,"Christopher Nolan’s epic film bio/thriller is so gripping that you feel like you’re right there with Oppenheimer, anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash – never mind the horrors it did unleash."
65,1,"I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone."
66,1,The easy part for Christopher Nolan was making Oppenheimer a big-screen behemoth...trickier was embedding within that blockbuster a film of almost excruciating intimacy; a psychodrama that probes the soul of the 20th century’s most unknowable man.
67,1,'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece.
68,1,"The narrative of Oppenheimer's life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth."
69,1,"Intellectually engaging, visually and sonically stimulating, and packing an emotional wallop."
70,1,"Christopher Nolan’s newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence."
71,0,"Oppenheimer ignores the darker sides of the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer in order to deliver a crowd-pleasing, blockbuster spectacle."
72,1,"Fascinating and frustrating, too close and aloof, this anti-biopic is a winning fusion of explosive paradoxes."
73,1,"Not only does Oppenheimer prove to be one the best-crafted biopics in recent memory, but it also boldly reaffirms the director’s auteur status."
74,1,"Everything about Christopher Nolan’s latest movie is massive. The level of shock and awe is breathtaking, but it can also be taxing."
75,1,The paradoxical thrill of Oppenheimer is that Nolan crafts an epic tale that’s intimate in nature—daring to go small when everyone is expecting a grand display of showmanship.
76,0,Oppenheimer should have been called Oppie. And the shorting of the film's name should have been accompanied by an equally dramatic shorting of the film itself.
77,1,"A rare film that deserves its hype, Oppenheimer stands tall as a biopic that presents complex and conflicting matters in a clearly understandable manner."
78,1,I was compelled throughout.
79,1,"Employing the stark angles of star Cillian Murphy’s expressive mien to great effect, Nolan gets into the head of the physicist, husband, father, womanizer, de facto politician, national hero, accused spy, and bomb-builder whose work changed the world."
80,1,"The visuals and technical aspects of Oppenheimer were always going to inspire praise, but it's Nolan's look at our frailty that sets this film in the upper echelon of an already famed filmography."
81,1,"Nolan’s name comes with a level of prestige, and he doesn’t disappoint. The sound, score, cinematography, acting and overall execution are immaculate."
82,1,"Befitting his paradigm-shattering protagonist, Nolan so audaciously merges form and content that he completely upends the ‘great-man’ biopic."
83,1,It's the film Christopher Nolan was born to direct.
84,0,"“Oppenheimer” is sensationally filmed. The performances are mostly great, provided the role is a dude. It is easy to see why so many people are praising what’s here. But it is stealth stupid. It is sneaky simplistic. It is camouflaged dumb."
85,1,"Admittedly complicated and confusing, Christopher Nolan's non-linear bio-pic is intense, exacting and explosive. Expect Oscar nods for Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., who deliver the most indelible performances of their respective careers."
86,1,"Oppenheimer is a serious and appropriately disturbing film about nuclear weapons and nuclear war. It is intended to leave viewers shaken, and it succeeds in that."
87,1,"OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan at his most operatic, his most ethereal, and his most horrific."
88,1,An absolute achievement in spectacle and Swiss-watch storytelling.
89,1,"Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it’s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men."
90,1,"You may know the story of the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” but experiencing his life and work through Nolan’s lens is a thrilling, captivating treat."
91,1,A directing high-point for the already acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Top-notch performances and a truly riveting tale of what is unfortunately our history. Not a very rewatchable movie and I really wish I would cease to have audio issues with Nolan films.
92,1,Played with unwavering solidity by Cillian Murphy...
93,1,"Starring Cillian Murphy, and his cheekbones, the film is dense, ambitious, complex, so very long (three hours) and impressive, even if it does drag by the end."
94,0,"Like J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan is a genius -- and, also like Oppenheimer, he may be too close to his subject matter to realize that he lost the thread."
95,1,"Good acting, good story but sluggish presentation."
96,1,"As dazzling as Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style often is, he still can't escape the trappings of the historical biopic with his three-hour epic, an overstuffed and often overwhelming account of the man known as the ""father of the atomic bomb."""
97,1,"Holding it all together is Murphy... He understands his character’s contradictions; more importantly, he has an uncanny instinct for how to reveal them."
98,1,"Cillian Murphy sets the screen ablaze, with a ferocious and intimate performance, and his face is a gateway into another reality. It’s perhaps the single greatest performance in any Nolan film, and a testament to Murphy’s devotion to his craft."
99,1,Oppenheimer deftly illuminates the allure and dangers of being caught in the sweep of history.
100,1,"Cute and good for younger kids, I give it a B."
101,1,Sandler injects the movie with bursts of anarchy that yank it away from the doubly dull corner of the internet that animated streaming movies are usually doomed to lurk in.
102,1,"As someone who largely ignored Sandler’s mid-career material, I’m really enjoying this turn into something that resembles maturity from the perpetual man-child, and Leo certainly has its heart in the right place."
103,1,Much better than Disney's Wish. an enormous success.
104,1,"Leo presents a kinder, gentler Adam Sandler than the one who got into an on-screen brawl with beloved game show host Bob Barker in Happy Gilmore."
105,0,"Sandler fans will find more to cling to here than I did, as I long ago lost all patience for his lazy brand of “moron” comedy packed with cronies and relatives."
106,1,"“Leo” combines a sweet-natured story with Sandler’s patented juvenile humor. It’s silly, but sincere."
107,1,"The film's warmth, sweetness and good humor are enough to overcome its inconsistencies. [Full Review in Spanish]"
108,1,"…Even with gripes and fully recognizing them, Leo is still filled with enough emotion to warrant a watch by yourself or with your kids. I don’t know how to explain it, but the heart shines through the formulaic nature."
109,1,A piece of clear cornball hokum that I enjoyed immensely.
110,1,"Robert Smigel, Adam Sandler, and their collaborators have made one of the funniest movies of the year that doubles as a love letter to the complexities of teaching kids, in or out of the classroom."
111,1,"Adam Sandler strikes comedic gold in a brilliant animated musical about raising good children and learning to be better parents. Leo's clever script, incisive songs, and fantastic characters will have families laughing hysterically this Thanksgiving."
112,1,A clever animation that talks honestly about kids and growing up – and still entertain the older crowd – is a positive thing in this negative world. I hope the spirit of “Leo” works well into the holidays and it just might.
113,0,"The Sandman’s modern lazy artistic side takes over, fully flexed in this Netflix project rife with stiff animation and awkward gags. Even the spare musical numbers with Sandler doing That Voice are underwhelming."
114,1,Appealing humor combines with pleasing animation to make Leo a good family movie night selection.
115,1,Think CHARLOTTE'S WEB (referenced as a bookend) if Wilbur was a classroom of insecure tweens desperate for anyone to listen to their problems without judgment. Add some endearing if forgettable songs and you get a well-meaning if forgettable film.
116,1,"I really liked Adam Sandler’s animated feature “Leo,” I mean I really liked it! It was charming, funny, uplifting, and brisk…until it wasn’t."
117,1,"The film has important messages for kids and could also remind some adults about the very real fears and concerns even young children feel, as well as their parallel needs for more independence and loving support."
118,1,"Brightly animated and with moments of surprising insight, there’s a warm likability to Leo that radiates, for those still in the classroom and those who left it long ago."
119,1,"The movie strikes a good balance between comedy, character development and music."
120,1,It is a charmer for kids and their parents who get a few lessons here along the way as well.
121,0,The sentimental message about a school pet trying to make the most of his final days crossed with oddball musical numbers and a spattering of misplaced crude humor makes you wonder if the movie was conceived for adults or children?
122,1,"But as spoofy as Leo can be, it touches on some honest truths about the lives of children."
123,0,"The musical sequences aren’t particularly interesting visually and will drag on for adults, yet it’s hard to imagine children sitting through... extended riffs on divorced parents or the courtship behaviors of reptiles and not getting a little bored."
124,1,An ideal lizard for future installments. [Full review in Spanish]
125,0,"There are some sweet moments and decent messages here, but the story lacks heart and soul: both of which are desperately needed."
126,0,"It sits in that weird gray area between satire and sincerity, between sweet and salty."
127,1,"Elevated by a silly yet tender Adam Sandler performance, Leo is touching, often hilarious, and could be helpful for children dealing with similar problems and insecurities as the ones present here"
128,1,"The film is fun, very funny, and filled with sage advice, which might be communicated in a goofy way but is, nonetheless, wholly sincere."
129,0,"Adam Sandler goes grampa mode in this mildly funny Netflix animated adventure playing a classroom reptile who gives life lessons to 5th graders. Goofy, comforting, unambitious."
130,1,"A perfect, lighthearted watch."
131,1,"“When I Was 10” and “Don’t Cry” address a sense of loss that children can’t quite explain. Whether it’s grieving a loved one or reflecting on a loss of innocence, these two songs explore that pain no one ever really discusses."
132,1,"This is all quite refreshing, and it comes with lots of songs and slick animation..."
133,0,"Perhaps some kids will watch “Leo” and take away some important lessons. If so, this will have been a valuable venture. Admirable goals aside, the movie just doesn’t work well enough for the life lessons to be worthwhile."
134,1,"Sandler’s soft-hearted comedic presence feels perfectly at home in the classroom, while Burr’s patented “get off my lawn” crankiness offsets things nicely."
135,1,Dumb doesn’t begin to describe the convoluted plot cooked up by Sandler and two chums. But I can’t deny laughing and getting a bit teary-eyed over what transpires during a prolonged 105 minutes.
136,1,"This animated musical is full of goofy songs and life lessons as the kids in this class find someone who makes them feel seen and heard. Leo is sweet, satirical, and fun for the whole family!"
137,1,What makes Leo special are the kinds of lessons on offer. Its message is well-timed for a generation who find themselves held hostage by their parents’ anxieties and stand to inherit a world of problems.
138,1,Strikes just the right balance between heart and fart jokes.
139,0,The problem is the story really doesn’t work.
140,0,"“Who is this for?” is a question that’s only asked by movies that aren’t working as well as they should, but it begs itself every few minutes in “Leo,” which can’t decide if it’s a movie for kids about parents, or a movie for parents about kids."
141,1,"At times uneven, but it’s still a sweet story of friendship and growing up."
142,1,A sweet and sometimes satirical movie that pillories modern parenting practices and includes just enough character detail to make Leo a credible New Age sage and the perfect foil for his wisecracking terrarium buddy Squirtle the turtle (Bill Burr).
143,1,"Both comedically clever and worthy in heart, Leo is a really strong animated feature that consistently delivers."
144,1,"The film can’t decide if it wants to be truly bizarre, which is when it’s funniest, or simple and sweet, when it’s the most dramatically effective. These aren’t the worst problems for a movie to have..."
145,1,"Charm doesn't make an animated film perfect, but as the animated Adam Sandler movie Leo proves, it can make for an entertaining time for the whole family."
146,1,"Bill Burr puts in a delightfully exasperated turn as Squirtle, Leo's turtle pal... It takes a while to get going, but Leo soon picks up once the zany reptile is let off the leash."
147,1,The second Sandler family project of the year...puts dad Adam back in the spotlight as a lizard who’s just learned of his own mortality...in a charming animation that casts him as part fairy godmother and part inspirational teacher.
148,1,A super fun kids movie that is filled with songs and important life lessons. The always funny Adam Sandler is the standout.
149,0,"The animation is serviceable but doesn’t break any new ground. The script has its amusing moments, but doesn’t offer any surprises. Some of the songs mimic Broadway showstoppers, but most are pretty cringey."
150,1,"Those in the target demographic will likely find it shockingly real about elementary school concerns, giving the movie a nice edge of relatability as it deals with typical Sandler goofballery."
151,0,"“Who is this for?” is a question that’s only asked by movies that aren’t working as well as they should, but it begs itself every few minutes in “Leo,” which can’t decide if it’s a movie for kids about parents, or a movie for parents about kids."

169,1,The second Sandler family project of the year...puts dad Adam back in the spotlight as a lizard who’s just learned of his own mortality...in a charming animation that casts him as part fairy godmother and part inspirational teacher.
170,1,A super fun kids movie that is filled with songs and important life lessons. The always funny Adam Sandler is the standout.
171,0,"The animation is serviceable but doesn’t break any new ground. The script has its amusing moments, but doesn’t offer any surprises. Some of the songs mimic Broadway showstoppers, but most are pretty cringey."
172,1,"Those in the target demographic will likely find it shockingly real about elementary school concerns, giving the movie a nice edge of relatability as it deals with typical Sandler goofballery."
173,1,"Cold bloodied and terrifying, but it sure does hold your attention."
174,1,"What does it take to be a paid assassin? Director David Fincher (‘Fight Club,” “Zodiac,” “The Social Network”) explores the qualifications in the cerebral neo-noir."
175,1,"The Killer won’t be remembered alongside David Fincher’s best, but that speaks more to the quality of his past work than the failings of this film."
176,1,A perfectly pitched crime thriller that's David Fincher's best film in a decade
177,1,While the film is enjoyable to watch it just doesn't bring anything new to genre - and that is something I have always expected from David Fincher in the past.
178,1,Think of this film as a corporate JOHN WICK. It's about revenge and it exists solely in the headspace and environments of the lead character's ilk. Civilians become window-dressing as Fassbender narrates the monotony and mantras that keep him alive.
179,1,"It may be a far cry from Fincher heavyweights like Se7en, Fight Club and Gone Girl), but considering how bleak and serious so many of his movies are, the pulpy feel of The Killer makes it a welcome addition to his catalogue."
180,1,"The Killer is an opportunity for America’s most stylish director to reboot, to get back to basics, to come in under two hours."
181,1,"The Killer is a film about a man who is bad at his job, how long you find that premise intriguing will correlate directly to how much you enjoy it."
182,1,"In its event horizon, it is a sophisticated, tense and entertaining thriller from Fincher. [Full review in Spanish]"
183,0,Fincher’s rejection of The Smiths aims to destroy the band’s great contributions to civilization. This anti-art horror film appeals to the hipster appetite for self-destruction.
184,1,David Fincher strikes a delicious balance with this neo-noir thriller about a methodical hitman: it is one of his slightest but most enjoyable feature films.
185,0,"In the end, I was somewhat amused and impressed with “The Killer’s” execution but found the story lacking, the protagonist, muddied. I couldn’t help but feel that I had consumed a meal of empty calories, leaving me hungry for more substance."
186,1,"Amidst the deliberate storytelling, the film shines in its action sequences, featuring well-executed hand-to-hand combat scenes."
187,0,"The Killer is intriguing due to Michael Fassbender in the lead role and David Fincher's direction, but the script goes nowhere fast."
188,0,"Despite a measured performance from Fassbender and a clear vision/understanding of world-building in Fincher’s approach to visual storytelling, The Killer lacks any kind of teeth."
189,1,"David Fincher’s latest thriller, The Killer, is cold to the touch and might even seem impenetrable, but it contains multitudes for anyone interested in finding meaning."
190,1,David Fincher’s Jeanne Dielman.
191,0,What is lacking in The Killer is any sense of stakes and passion.
192,1,"Fassbender puts in a straight, steely-eyed performance as he goes through his death list, with director David Fincher giving the straightforward crime drama some strong doses of noir style, especially as the killer gets down to the dirty work."
193,1,A master class in hitmanship given by a deluded teacher...
194,0,The Killer is dead on arrival—a cheerless bit of 21st century pop existentialism
195,1,"David Fincher’s latest is a minimalist epic about  a contract killer who appears to have no personality whatsoever. Despite all this, it is a wildly entertaining effort."
196,1,"The Killer provides a lurid kind of escapism we haven’t really seen since the ’60s, a suave, cold-blooded but very, very funny kind of savoir-faire."
197,1,"This revenge odyssey is minor Fincher, but executed nonetheless in style."
198,1,Fincher re-teams with Andrew Kevin Walker to such seamless ends that it feels like two or three years have passed since their last collaboration instead of nearly 30.
199,1,THE KILLER is a return to form for David Fincher.
200,1,"Craftsmanship doesn’t quite raise The Killer to the level of art, but in a sea of streaming options, it creates an island of pleasure, however fleeting."
201,1,"Michael Fassbender's modern hitman murders people from an abandoned WeWork, eats tactical McMuffins , and sounds like AJ Soprano. Wonderful."
202,1,"David Fincher's The Killer is an intriguing character study in and of itself, with no gimmicks, that has enough layers to emerge as one of the best works the iconic filmmaker has delivered in the past ten years."
203,1,"The Killer is pure David Fincher – moody, atmospheric, gloomy, and suffused with a thread of dark, sardonic humor."
204,1,"Within the first five seconds, The Killer gives off major Cool Girl energy as David Fincher’s sleekest film It is a true, technical treat for longtime Fincher Fans, proving why he is a master of the digital film age."
205,1,"The Killer is what happens when you take [an action thriller]... and put it in the hands of master craftspersons and artists who elevate every aspect of the production, so that the whole becomes ever greater than the sum of its parts."
206,1,"In addition to being a smart movie, the action here is also good. As far as movies that get you inside the head of a killer, this is up there."
207,1,Here’s the thing… you will know in the first 10 minutes whether you are into this film or hate it and never want to be in this man’s head every again. It’s not a “maybe it will change” kind of situation. In or out.
208,1,"This story of a lone contract killer is shallow, familiar, and based on pessimistic and narrow philosophies of life, but it's rich with craft and style. The Killer moves beautifully and is never boring."
209,1,"For all the sleek and stylish espionage and action that Fincher delivers with this film, it’s also arguably his funniest."
210,1,"Under a different filmmaker, The Killer would be your standard assassin flick with overblown action scenes and idiotic side characters. Fincher makes The Killer distinctly his, a lean and methodical look at the job itself..."
211,1,Washed-out and callowly nihilistic as a narrative but tasty cinema.
212,0,"Fincher is adept at excoriating the darkness of the human soul, but he's missed his mark with a character so blindly determined to prove he doesn't have one."
213,1,"The Killer is an engrossing ride along with a hired gun, made by an artist who never wastes his canvas."
214,1,... There is something in the coldness that defines The Killer that prevents it from shining as brightly as [Fincher's] other titles. [Full review in Spanish]
215,1,"Though The Killer isn't by far the best from [Fincher], it's beyond entertaining and enjoyable... [Full review in Spanish]"
216,1,The film is a veritable tone poem on the nature of work in the modern world. The Killer is a simultaneously hollow and profound meditation on the numerous ways identity has been swallowed up and voided by the various demands of commerce and brand.
217,1,"I loved this film and enjoyed the inner monologue from this concise killer, Fassbender delivers a deadly wink and a nod. I give it an A grade."
218,1,The 70s-influenced thriller moves at a steady pace venturing into neo-noir territory. The visual palette is crisp and sharp with plenty of Fassbender closeups and a downtempo score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that prowls through each frame.
219,1,Michael Fassbender is fantastic in this role... This is very stylized film from David Fincher and it's really well-done.
220,1,"Even when having fun in a violent world of contract killing, Fincher sprinkles in a taste of his worldview. It’s a poignant statement on who holds power."
221,1,"When it comes to themes of power, control, and attention to detail, this might be the closest thing David Fincher has come to giving us a “personal” film."
222,0,"David Fincher’s ice-cold kind of comedy is admirable, and a good exercise for the analytical. But what I couldn’t figure out is why all of this didn’t add up to something more fun."
223,1,"Controlled by a tracked heartbeat and activated by a neck crack, watching this man make preparations and blankness fiery with potential energy is utterly captivating."
224,0,"The Killer’s observations and commentary are very similar to The Watchmen’s Rorschach. Unfortunately, we’re trapped watching this dull hitman’s actions."
225,0,"…annoyingly familiar tale of an assassin’s creed, full of sound and fury, but signifying absolutely nothing…"
226,0,John Wick Lite
227,1,"The Killer is ultimately Minor Fincher, which of course is better than Major Lots of Other People."
228,1,"... draws us in through a wry and sardonic sense of humor, and resists transitioning into a conventional morality tale. It’s simply a good film about a bad man."
229,1,"Fincher’s craft is on display here as you may not find yourself on the edge of your seat, but your mind will be constantly engaged. This is one of those movies that won’t need you to power through the slowness..."
230,1,"t moves and weaves through its story and the mind of the assassin in a way that doesn’t give the viewers a chance to realize they’re rooting for a murderer-for-hire, and that’s exhilarating."
231,1,"The Killer has an old-fashioned feel and still manages to nail its target by bringing dashes of freshness, wit and unpredictability to this well-worn genre."
232,0,"For fans of the director’s distinctive style, The Killer may be worth a watch, but it may leave some viewers craving a deeper and more emotionally resonant story."
233,1,"The Killer is an excellent thriller put together by a master in the genre. While there aren’t any surprises in the plot, this is a visually stunning yet uncomfortable-to-watch movie elevated by its star-studded cast."
234,1,"What exists on the page reads as isolated, yet Fincher and Fassbender play it as internal, even intimate."
235,1,"The rest of The Killer – its seamless visual aesthetic, the dread-filled score, the episodic rhythm – echoes this oddly meta coming-of-age arc..."
236,1,"Besides possessing a notable presence, Michael Fassbender is gifted with magnetism. [Full review in Spanish]"
237,0,"The Killer’s target dodged a bullet. Viewers who skip this film can, too."
238,1,"[A] slick, brutal and utterly brilliant action movie."
239,1,The Killer is a comical character assassination.
240,1,"This cold and calculated assassin is played effortlessly by Michael Fassbender. There is a calming intensity throughout and an excellent score to elevate each moment. The film isn’t always as thrilling as it wants to be, but it sticks with you."
241,1,Leave it to Fincher to find something personal in an ode to impersonality.
242,1,"It's Fincher's deliciously depraved conceit that his perfectionist process is not unlike the killer's. In his hands, and a mesmerizing title turn from Fassbinder, what could have been a hitman cliche becomes a tangle of loose ends hauntingly left untied."
243,1,"The Killer a pointless film about the pointlessness of existence. But, like, Fincher."
244,0,"[T]echnical proficiency and stylish visuals and to a certain extent, [Michael] Fassbender’s perfectly-typecast nameless killer role aren’t enough to overcome the movie’s overall dull and uninvolving story."
245,1,"The film is a lean, often brutal globe-trotting adventure with a solid performance by Fassbender and stand-out sound design."
246,1,"Everything is in its right place and the result is a stylish and slick revenge thriller, but you will be wishing there was a bit more to it."
247,1,"It’s like “Fight Club” and “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” came together to create the most Fincher-y movie ever. This film is a mood, and that mood screams David Fincher."
248,1,"The two hours patiently go by in a steady telling of revenge as Fassbender methodically stalks his prey and eliminates those who wronged him. Even though some moments are exciting, the overall narrative is similar to wallpaper, it just exists as we watch."
249,0,Everything here is tantalizingly close to calculated perfection that it comes almost as a surprise how The Killer ends up missing its mark.
250,1,"This outing bears his indelible mark of quality, even if, in the director’s prodigious filmography, “The Killer” amounts to minor Fincher."
251,1,"I'm not suggesting his story cries out for a sequel, but by the time this very dark comedy reaches its strangely sunny ending, you're curious to see what job this killer — and Fincher himself — might take on next."
252,1,The Killer is not Fincher’s best; it’s more of an offbeat character study with impressive production values than a fully realized drama.
253,0,"The character is boring and so is this movie, but like the supremely skilled Fincher, who can’t help but make images that hold your gaze even as your mind wanders, Fassbender does keep you watching."
254,1,"You’ll eat it up and watch it again, perhaps only to realize that maybe there’s something deeper that’s being said about a general lack of empathy in a short-sighted world where we often feel we just need to get the job done, no matter the toll."
255,1,"It is that attention to detail that makes The Killer a precise and meticulous thriller, displaying the various reasons why David Fincher does not miss."
256,1,"'The Killer' is grimly entertaining and although it may not be a laugh-a-minute comedy or a wham-bam-actioner, it still has more than ample style and substance to make it worth the time."
257,1,"Though the film's neo-noir nature allows Fincher to indulge in some sinfully entertaining displays of violence, much of its actual power lies in using the protagonist's chosen vocation as an entry point into commentary on the nature of the gig economy."
258,0,"While The Killer represents something of a stylistic endpoint for Fincher, however, it does demonstrate the limits of simply following things out to their logical conclusion, in that one is left wondering whether more could have been done."
259,1,"David Fincher sticks to the ""plan,"" albeit sometimes to a fault. Still, if that's the film's only real miss, then like its titular character, The Killer is definitely one to watch out for."
260,0,The Killer's globe-trotting plot is self-explanatory and is not remotely close to being a top-tier David Fincher film.
261,1,"The Killer is an incredibly nuanced and introspective feature that would be among the cream of any other film catalogue....Fincher proves himself to be one of the most exciting, observant, and oddly human filmmakers working today."
262,1,"If you are expecting a solid, well-crafted character piece you'll be satisfied"
263,1,...one of the best and most spellbinding thrillers to come out of Hollywood in a good long while.
264,0,The director’s stylistic touch and smooth visionary aesthetic can’t outweigh the pretentious undertone and egregious narration accompanying the director’s intuition.
265,1,"While it doesn’t have the thematic depth or resonance to quite matchup to Fincher’s masterpieces Se7en, The Social Network and Zodiac, The Killer is undoubtedly a slowly engrossing and subversive take on the assassin film."
266,1,Fincher trusts the faces of his actors... His faith in Fassbender is amply rewarded -- even the way the actor’s arms smoothly swing past his hips is expressive -- but Fincher is the true star of the film.
267,1,"When it comes to breathlessness, it's no Bourne, but the antihero allure of the bucket hat-wearing, Smiths-loving contractor gives Fassbender a perfect comeback role."
268,1,"'The Killer' might be described as anti-philosophical, at least in the sense that The Killer is constantly undercutting his own self-important mental blather."
269,1,"[W]e are treated to a cavalcade of slick assassinations strung together by the barest minimum of a plot. All the better to savor Michael Fassbender at his most ominous, reminding us at varying points in his narration that empathy is a weakness."
270,0,Like watching a magnificent athlete on a Stairmaster.
271,0,"Stylish and occasionally amusing, but it’s essentially a one-joke affair that Fincher and Fassbender are unable to sustain."
272,1,"Moments of extraordinary brutality are to be found here, but its greatest success is in its quiet self-assurance."
273,1,"The film does not pretend to be presenting radical or new beliefs. Yet by the end, it reveals the myths, the distortions and the made-up fallacies that have been presented as truth for centuries. And that is the most radical thing it could have done."
274,1,"If Ibram X. Kendi’s 2016 bestseller <em>Stamped from the Beginning</em> has been banned from your local library, Netflix has come to the rescue."
275,1,Its relentless focus on historical wrongs could inadvertently fuel another wave of rebellion in America.
276,1,Roger Ross Williams’s vigorous documentary on the history of racism in America is in some ways an introduction for beginners.
277,1,"A pointed look to the past to better understand the present, filmmaker Roger Ross Williams’ Stamped from the Beginning is a tremendous work of scholarship and education."
278,1,"In addition to interviews and archival images, film clips and news footage, Williams (“Cassandro” “Life, Animated”) leans into animation."
279,1,Stamped from the Beginning is a bold attempt to animate the racist images that plague the American imagination.
280,1,"Won't necessarily surprise those who already know this history, but may still be tough to watch for those sensitive to stories about the exploitation of marginalized people."
281,1,"Even if Stamped from the Beginning frequently weakens its more nuanced scholarship by drifting into Kendi’s trademark good vs. evil narratives, it’s undeniably a well-intentioned film that gets many things right."
282,1,"Filmmaker Roger Ross Williams (Life, Animated) presents a prolific and thought-provoking documentary about race in the United States."
283,1,"""Stamped from the Beginning"" drives home Williams’ point that racism is deeply embedded in our culture and society and that it takes this kind of fury to talk about it adequately."
284,1,"In its own and detailed way, Stamped from the Beginning seeks and tells many truths..."
285,1,"Will the US ever arrive at a point where “existing while Black” is not considered a crime? The beginning is chronicled here, but the end still feels a long way off."
286,1,"Provocative, well-edited and captivating."
287,1,"Beautifully edited and passionately argued, the film brings together an abundance of compelling evidence and potent imagery, including specially commissioned animation, powerfully flanked by the music of Public Enemy and Little Simz among others."
288,1,"What is shown is an absorbing piece that inspects the harsh reality of American history. The efforts could have been more stimulating, but the investigation is valuable all the same."
289,1,"'Stamped From the Beginning' explores not only the racist tropes that brainwashed America for centuries, but also the origins that are rooted in sustaining and keeping ownership of power."
290,1,Myths and Stereotypical ideology is shattered by Roger Ross Williams while educating the masses that what's wrong with Black people is absolutely nothing.  It's powerful from a truth sayer director who never holds back on the truth regardless what form.
291,1,"While the stories and histories of Black people in America might not be new information, its presentation in “Stamped” is absolutely new, commendable and should be required viewing."
292,1,Stamped From the Beginning is an invitation. The history is harsh but Williams foregrounds a structure that doesn’t alienate.
293,1,Stamped From The Beginning is an important and eye-opening film that should be seen by everyone everywhere as it challenges conventional thought on the relationship between Black people and America.
294,1,A visually and sonically swirling text.
295,1,"While the film takes a relatively conventional approach to the subject—talking heads, title cards, vérité, and awkward graphics–it synthesizes the creation and perpetuation of anti-Black racism and white supremacy."

304,1,"While the film takes a relatively conventional approach to the subject—talking heads, title cards, vérité, and awkward graphics–it synthesizes the creation and perpetuation of anti-Black racism and white supremacy."
305,0,The film mostly concentrates on Mike’s familial travails and history. It flails around trying to come up with psychologically resonant characteristics for its protagonist. It ends up with an inert and implausible narrative.
306,0,"Intended (apparently) as a horror flick, it’s not scary, and, despite the absurdity of the story, it’s not funny. It’s barely anything at all."
307,1,"A lot of it feels like an Elm Street sequel, and you’ve got to respect a film about menacing animatronics that casts Mary Stuart Masterson."
308,0,"An early sequence where we watch these mascots come to life and dispatch a group of people shows promise for something better (and the animatronics do look pretty solid), but it’s all for naught. This is about as good as cardboard pizza."
309,1,"A video game adaptation made overtly for the fans and only the fans.  Newcomers will be totally lost, but it's target audience should have fun."
310,0,So much plot is crammed into this nearly 2-hour film that it's honestly quite shocking that there's nary a scare to be found.
311,1,"Convoluted subplots risk derailing the narrative on more than one occasion, but Freddy and his menacing cohorts, created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, do just about enough to deliver some fun and frights."
312,0,"Seriously, how do you mess up a setup as foolproof as this one?"
313,0,"One of the most forgettable, half-a---d horror movies of the past few years. Five Nights at Freddy's isn't just an ambitious failure; it's a film that treads the water of familiar cliches for an hour and a half and then fizzles out."
314,0,The film struggles to balance its disparate tones and subject matter (fun animatronics with child murder) while barely containing enough scares and violence to act as a gateway horror flick for pre-teens. At least Matthew Lillard is having fun.
315,0,The problem could hinge on the film’s rating. An R might have opened the door to more malevolence. A PG-13 simply makes the lights flicker.
316,1,"As a review, I enjoyed it for what it was, though hardcore fans seem to see Easter eggs left and right. So I'll give it a B- as a midground."
317,1,The FNAF movie will likely work better for hardcore fans than it will for newcomers. The evil Chuck E Cheese aesthetic is effectively fun and the animatronics look great. The main character's story and the Fazbear Pizzeria fail to connect fully.
318,1,"With humor and a few minor bloody scenes plus the ghost children element, Five Nights at Freddy’s falls somewhere between R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps and Gremlins. It’s creepy fun for kids and adults, however, young children may find a few scenes frightening"
319,0,"Five Nights at Freddy’s offers some fun thrills and manages to bring the animatronics to life, but unfortunately the same can’t be said for its human characters."
320,0,"Maybe the fans are satiated by reams of lore, but we wanted blood. Even if it was a bit of a gory romp, that wouldn't do much to paper over the technical cracks, like some of its shoddy editing. Josh Hutcherson innocent, of course."
321,0,"It delivers creepy animatronics and excellent visual effects; unfortunately, almost everything else falls flat. The story is unnecessarily convoluted with awkward dialogue, and the impressive slasher sequences are few and far in-between."
322,1,"The film expands the lore of the simple game it's based on, allowing it to go beyond jump scares and cheap thrills. It starts off slow but builds into a satisfying mystery."
323,0,"I wish Five Nights at Freddy’s was wackier, bloodier, and actually scary."
324,1,A lot better than what was expected but let's face it it was the actors in this film that saved it.
325,0,A movie made for gamers and not the general audience.
326,1,"Lulls settle in when Mike’s backstory is belabored or when a cop shows up repeatedly just to drop exposition, but the film should serve as a macabre-cute gateway horror picture for younger audiences and fans of the franchise."
327,0,"... A succession of repetitive scenes replete with bland characters (with the notable exception of William Afton, wonderfully played by Matthew Lillard) that explore '80s iconography retrofitted for the new millennium. [Full review in Spanish]"
328,0,"This adaptation of a popular 2014 video game has some elements that really work well, but ultimately the latest entry to the horror genre falls short in large part to an uneven tone that can’t exactly decide how dark it truly wants to be."
329,0,"[S]ame-day theater and streaming release dates, wicked puppetry, and the Matthew Lillard return to horror. In those regards, this movie did deliver. I choose to save those three things from this burning building as I watch the rest go up in flames."
330,0,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a decent entry-level horror flick and the animatronics look fantastic, but it's story is an overstuffed mess that tries to pack in too much lore at once."
331,1,"This is a flawed motion picture, but it offers families the chance to be scared together, and when it works, it is both creepy and fun."
332,0,"So little makes sense in this utterly predictable film, that it makes even the few and far between legit scare sequences not worth it"
333,0,Director Emma Tammi wants the viewer to spend Five Nights at Freddy’s. But it is essentially one night too many.
334,0,"With a cast of one, a single setting, and minimal dialogue, the game did much better storytelling than its overloaded failed-trope adaptation."
335,1,Will probably become a cult classic. [Full review in Spanish]
336,1,"Overall, the film needed more of the tension the video game series is known for, not to mention their arcade-fun terror, but it still serves as a solid Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise opener."
337,0,An intriguing premise undermined by simply terrible storytelling...
338,0,Five Nights at Freddy’s might play better for video game enthusiasts who know this world already. Newcomers might not find the edge they were hoping for.
339,0,"The pacing is bad, the plotting is both convoluted and also somehow weirdly shallow, the writing is laughable, and the action is simplistic. I would not recommend seeing Five Nights at Freddy’s, as it is not good."
340,0,"Five Nights at Freddy's could have used a couple more evenings working on the screenplay. Turgid, muddled, and lacking atmosphere, five minutes with Fazbear would have sufficed. One of the worst movies of 2023."
341,1,"There are some pacing issues, and the acting could be more balanced. Keeping the majority of the anxiety inducing chills from the video game franchise it stems from, Five Nights at Freddy’s delivers a solid movie experience."
342,1,"What director Emma Tammi understood was fans of this property dont just want the scares, but the lore as well, which invests you in these weird characters and their fates and brings us back again and again."
343,1,"A so so adaptation that's entertaining enough, but a must-see for the expertly crafted animatronics."
344,1,"Even if Five Nights at Freddy's somewhat ignores the beginning of the game, the film has its charm.  [Full review in Spanish]"
345,1,"Five Nights at Freddy's has a fun and creepy premise, but ultimately is a little too methodical and slowly paced to deliver true thrills."
346,1,A story that will delight both fans of the original video games (FNAF) and newcomers alike. [Full review in Spanish]
347,0,Five Nights at Freddy’s is just another poor video game adaptation for the garbage pile.
348,0,"The film unsuccessfully tries to merge two disparate tones with an uninteresting and often nonsensical plot. Opportunities for animatronic chaos and excitement are mostly left on the table, resulting in an overall dull affair."
349,0,"It's all very tedious when it's not confusing, and it can't even count on atmosphere to salvage it."
350,0,"The movie will make you want to quit movies about video games, and perhaps video games as well."
351,0,"A rushed second half, struggling to explain certain character's storylines fails to make the film thrilling or fun. I would say watch ""Child's Play"" or ""MEGAN"" if you want to see a silly, but clever horror about products that shouldn't be coming to life."
352,0,...a milquetoast viewing experience...unable to determine just what kind of movie (this) truly wants this to be.
353,0,Video game adaptation teeters between serious horror and bloodless camp.
354,0,Casual moviegoers may enjoy the dynamic between Mike and Abby but shouldn’t expect much from the disjointed screenplay beyond the odd jump scare and perhaps some chuckles.
355,0,"Five Nights at Freddy’s is a hodgepodge of a horror movie. The script and direction throw nearly the kitchen sink at the audience, but nothing feels fully fleshed out."
356,0,"Fans of the video game of the same name will know what’s possible in this spin-off movie, but anyone approaching it as just another horror film might be confounded."
357,1,[Five Nights at Freddy's] is a nice supernatural story that captures the sensations of Goosebumps and the '90s The Midnight Club for a multi-format generation that does not understand entertainment as a static window. [Full review in Spanish]
358,0,"With its mix of not-scary-enough horror and too-extensive backstory, this ends up feeling more like franchise maintenance than entertainment. It's a film that exists to further the brand rather than be enjoyable in its own right"
359,0,"While it is simply wrong to pass Five Nights at Freddy's off as being another lazy horror adaptation, the film is clearly a monstrous mess."
360,0,"Instead of catering to the in-built audience ready and waiting, ""Five Nights"" wastes time trying to win over people who couldn’t care less. As a result, what should’ve been an intricate, twisted, and absurd treat is demoted to generic horror movie sludge."
361,0,"It strains to erect a supernatural universe while neglecting to fulfill the basic promises of a scary film built on a gag premise, stretching its dreary tale of trauma to nearly two hours."
362,1,"""Five Nights at Freddy’s"" is a decent flick that provides entertainment and scares for younger and older generations. Is it without flaws in its story? No, but this supernatural horror is still fun to see."
363,0,I'm not sure why this movie was even made. The plot was all over the place and was overly predictable. I couldn't tell if I should laugh with it or at it.
364,1,Five Nights at Freddy's is a good adaptation of the video game of the same name that manages to keep the viewer tense throughout the entire show thanks to its creepy atmosphere and impressive special effects. [Full review in Spanish]
365,1,"If we ignore that this is supposed to be a horror film... on its own merit, the film is fun to watch. From start to finish we are taken on a journey that has emotional depth and connects us to the main characters."
366,1,"It’s an uneven scarefest, but the bloodthirst is at least refreshing."
367,1,"Though it may not be the film we asked for this Halloween weekend, it's refreshing to see Josh Hutcherson in a starring role again in this quirky horror fairytale."
368,1,"As it is, the movie seems best suited for those who prefer their scares within boundaries, and aren’t too concerned with plot logic."
369,1,Emma Tammi has done the unexpected. She made a tasty meal out of pre-packaged pizza dough when most folks were expecting Chuck E. Cheese-level quality.
370,0,"Five Nights at Freddy's is awful. They didn't have anything for two hours, much less five nights."
371,1,"The seesaw definitely tips toward fan service, though there are some horror pleasures that anyone can appreciate."
372,0,"A horror film doesn’t have to be R rated to be good, but Five Nights at Freddy’s feels like 30 minutes of interesting ideas padded out to almost two hours"
373,0,"Based on the popular horror video games, this movie starts out well, with sympathetic characters, a fun design, and an appealing comical tone, but it goes on too long and eventually falls apart."
374,1,"It isn’t perfect, far from it, but try to tell that to the kids who love FNAF and they will have thousands of reasons why you are wrong."
375,0,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a yawn and a half ... Sorry, Freddy. Back to the stage for you."
376,0,"Five Nights at Freddy's forgets to be fun or scary, limiting what genre effectiveness can be mustered up here."
377,0,Not fun enough. Not scary enough. It just exists.
378,1,Newcomers will appreciate that a PG-13 rated film isn’t afraid to kill kids and shred unwitting trespassers. Genre and game fans will howl with appreciation at the Easter eggs embedded throughout.
379,1,Five Nights at Freddy’s was overall a bit too long but pretty much an okay movie for the season and did right by its source material.
380,0,"Almost worth a recommendation, but when a film about animatronics killing has very little animatronics killing, many won't get their money's worth."
381,0,"The plot is as dingy and full of holes as a 10-year-old pair of underpants, and about as much fun to watch."
382,0,"For something that features an enormous robot chicken armed with a cupcake, [it's] an oddly serious, even dour movie."
383,0,Five Nights at Freddy’s commits the worst crime of all – it’s dull from beginning to end. It’s a frustrating miss on a premise and franchise that can be so much more.
384,0,"Hutcherson is admirably committed to the film-makers’ apparent desire to make something miserable of a scenario that, as one Oscar-winning actor has shown, is more accommodating of psychedelic comedy."
385,1,"[A] fun gateway horror film ... has [plot] holes bigger than a pizzeria ... but it’s a film where those of a certain age will jump and shriek at the right places, then laugh over how they survived."
386,0,"...a classic case of getting so carried away with other things that you shortchange what people are coming to see. More specifically, it gets bogged down in bland uninteresting drama rather than delivering the wacky animatronic horror it advertises."
387,1,"Five Nights At Freddy’s saving grace for it is that it’s immediately available on Peacock. While it may not live up to the ambition of the project or the IP, it is perfect for the Halloween season."
388,0,"Sloppy, boring and unscary, Five Nights at Freddy's is a big letdown. [Full review in Spanish]"
389,0,"I hate singling out actors because bad movies are rarely their fault, but Hutcherson’s terrible performance is right at home in this stuffed dog of a thriller."
390,1,"Emma Tammi’s horror-mystery film isn’t perfect, but it’s compelling and scary enough to beg for sequels."
391,0,"Franchise devotees will find a little more traction here via inside-baseball references... Beyond that, the movie commits the indefensible crime of being no fun whatsoever."
392,0,"... A movie that is somewhat schematic in its development, superficial, and remains halfway throughout. [Full review in Spanish]"
393,1,It’s a fun gateway horror movie for kids—and the easily scared who want to test their limits lightly.
394,1,"This is gateway horror, and it’s pretty damn fun gateway horror at that. But the “PG-13 horror is inherently evil” crowd will no doubt walk away deeply disappointed. A solid effort that underdelivers in some areas but exceeds expectations in others."
395,0,I was more bored than scared.
396,1,"It has a great look and feels true to the game, but it is a bit overwritten to add a story to otherwise mundane game play."
397,0,"Josh Hutcherson is good as Mike but aside from that, viewers will be longing to see “Game Over” flash on cinema screens."
398,0,"Though deadly robots and spooky kids would each be frightening enough alone without them teaming up, somehow, when they’re together here, they’re not that scary or much fun."
399,0,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It is slow, it is not scary, it is not funny. It's just not a well done movie."
400,0,"Like Teletubbies with chainsaws, or knife-wielding Fimbles, it’s absurd. But not in a good way."
401,0,"Yet while there’s enough ambient dread in this “Five Nights at Freddy’s” feature to indicate why the video games are so popular, there’s more by-the-numbers plotting than needed."
402,0,"Five Nights At Freddy’s is a strange film, uneven in tone, encumbered by a very grown-up serial killer plot and disastrously lacking a sense of humour."
403,0,Five Nights At Freddy's is four nights too many.
404,1,The only real caveat is the horror is diluted since the film needed to maintain a PG rating for maximum box office.
405,1,Flavors of Nickelodeon and the show All That come back strong with a film that's equal parts nostalgia and nutty. Grade B-
406,0,"To update the story to 2023, the filmmakers add a few new characters and a tiresome AI plot, winding up with a Thanksgiving diversion that functions just fine playing in the background as families gather for their holiday meals."
407,0,"It is a petrified Happy Meal buried in the back of your childhood closet, reheated in the microwave. Good Burger 2 will give the most nostalgic customer food poisoning."
408,1,Everyone involved in the making of Good Burger 2 seem like they really care about this world and these characters. Ed (Kel Mitchell) and Dexter (Kenan Thompson) are a throwback to classic comedy duos like Abbott and Costello & Laurel and Hardy.
409,0,"Good Burger 2 does its best to recapture the magic, but it sadly doesn’t do the original film justice. It’s a goofy sequel that doesn’t stick the landing or even have a strong enough story to carry through."
410,1,"Fans of the 1997 effort should be pleased with this revival, which finds its groove quickly and wisely puts Mitchell and Thompson back in charge of silliness."
411,1,"Good Burger 2 tastes exactly how you remembered it, and it’s made with the same love and care of how it was crafted all those years ago."
412,0,"There are some goofy puns, non sequiturs, and absurdist jokes that land... The rest of the comedy is primarily listless reheating, and anyone looking for a visual hit of nostalgia may be disappointed."
413,1,"Good Burger and All That aimed their humor directly at kids too young for the grown-up stuff — or, at least, the ones too young to tell their parents they watched it in secret. This movie works on that same wavelength."
414,1,"Good Burger 2 certainly isn’t a masterpiece, but Kenan & Kel still have the special sauce that makes this film work."

455,0,"The pacing was off and that impacted the emotional beats they were going for. If they were more consistent with the characterizations and gave more insight as to what was going on, it would have greatly improved my viewing experience."
456,0,"The cinematography was fantastic and John David Washington gave a solid performance. However, the pacing and lack of urgency really made this feel like a chore to get through."
457,1,"The Creator is one of the most interesting (and best-looking) movies of the year, and potentially an example on how Hollywood can reign in budgets and allow for more stories that are original and take chances."
458,1,Gareth Edwards makes a compelling argument in support of Artificial Intelligence in this visually-stunning film starring John David Washington.
459,0,"Although ‘New Asia’ is America’s enemy, we are encouraged to transfer our sympathies in that direction. Yet the abiding vision of Asian life is a mass of touristic clichés seen through western eyes."
460,0,"It's a shame that the weak writing undermines The Creator so much, as there are some intriguing concepts that could have been compelling if executed better. For the most part, it's a mishmash of other movies with not much to say on its own."
461,0,"At the end of the day, this is an album you buy for the cover art but never actually want to listen to."
462,1,"The Creator has astonishing visuals, but that’s where its charm ends. While the performances are strong, thrilling elements of the film swap actual excitement for a more traditional science fiction film that pays tribute to its influences and little else."
463,1,"The Creator is incredibly immersive from a visual and world building perspective, however it leaves a lot to be desired with its writing."
464,0,The emotional core of the film is crushed by its focus on pyrotechnics and visual poetry. [Full review in Spanish]
465,0,Builds to a ludicrous final act in which everything that needs to go right for a gutsy task falls into eye-rolling place.
466,0,...an ambitious misfire that should’ve topped out at 90 minutes.
467,0,"I liked aspects of it, mostly the visuals... It's just too bad the story was derivative and seemed to crib from so many other sci-fi epics."
468,1,The Creator is a gorgeous feature in all the ways that matter and it's certainly a sci-fi epic that shouldn't be missed in a year that's severely lacking the charm of an old-fashioned blockbuster!
469,0,The Creator would be a better science fiction novel.
470,0,"Gets the visuals right, in this high-tech sci-fi film, but the story wrong."
471,1,"... a mixed bag. It’s a visually stunning, intriguing tale with echoes of the Vietnam War and science-fiction classics such as 1982’s Blade Runner. Yet ... the film leaves little room for nuance."
472,1,"Sincere in its execution and with at times a mystifying beauty, as well as some serious thrills, Edwards has yet again rewarded audiences with his leap of faith."
473,1,Character and story remain Edwards' bugaboo...
474,1,"The Creator is a thought-provoking, visually memorizing, sci-fi journey that’ll tantalize the imagination. Director Gareth Edwards put together an intellectually stimulating film that really challenges audiences to wrestle with profound questions."
475,1,"A satisfying swirl of sci-fi, gorgeous visuals, and story. It only skims the surface of the ideological quandaries it begins to set up re: what is life / intelligence. Still it is well acted and a good time at the movies."
476,0,"As the film progresses, the plot becomes swampier, the pacing irregular and a kind of need for the film to awaken its audience with more and more action scenes stands out. [Full review in Spanish]"
477,1,"Its reach certainly exceeds its grasp, but the ambition that Edwards, Washington, and the cast and crew had for this project is meaningful."
478,1,John David Washington is incredible as our lead in this sci-fi thriller with an emotional core.
479,1,"Whether taken as a metaphor for the Vietnam War or as a Christian allegory, The Creator asks basic, yet deep questions related to artificial intelligence and humanity."
480,1,"Many science fiction films make future earth look the same as it is now, perhaps because of the expense of making it look different. This movie makes future earth look a lot different. It looks even more expensive than its estimated budget of $80 million."
481,0,"Centering an American character in a thinly veiled story about the Vietnam War would have been cutting edge back in the 1980s, but in the 21st century it feels regressive, slack and inert"
482,1,"Washington's performance comes direct from a smaller, better film, but those big science-fiction backdrops he's standing in front of definitely have an appeal of their own."
483,0,An engaging sci-fi action film with strong visuals but becomes hindered by a weak third act and not the most compelling lead actor. The script could've used several rewrites to accompany its lofty ambitions.
484,0,"It doesn't hit its entertainment peak until the last thirty minutes, and that is too late to make it special."
485,1,"The Creator is an intriguing, stimulating and intense affair, which addresses one of the greatest issues of our age. A tough choice to make between head and heart."
486,0,"Gareth Edwards' film takes a series of borrowed situations and blends them into a smooth, featureless gruel."
487,0,"I'd be lying if I said I didn't laugh every single time Joshua screams ""Alphie!..."""
488,1,"By far, though, the film’s greatest asset is its organic and rich visual identity. The Creator immediately enters the narrow pantheon of visually spectacular blockbuster films that are almost worthwhile on their vision alone."
489,0,"Had potential, but falls short of its Kubrickian ambitions."
490,1,"In the film, an off-handed remark speaks volumes when Joshua asks a child named Alphie (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) what she’d like, believing she will ask for a sweet treat. Instead, she says matter-of-factly, “For robots to be free.”"
491,1,"The main question about ""The Creator"" is: How has a movie this good and this big arrived in theaters with so little fanfare?"
492,1,"With Gareth Edwards (Rogue One, Godzilla), you expect thoughtfully rendered sci-fi full of visual flair and detail, and this delivers."
493,1,Go for the delectable cinematic experience -- including the Hans Zimmer score -- but keep other expectations under control.
494,1,"This movie’s thoughts about the future of artificial intelligence aren’t well-formed enough to make it a great science-fiction film, though it is remarkable in some other ways."
495,1,"[Director Gareth Edwards] has created an impressively hushed, serious meditation on humanity born from machinery. The Creator may not fully come to life, but at least it understands that life, in all its forms, is precious."
496,0,"I rooted for The Creator, hoping this latest futuristic extravaganza would be a major addition to the big-screen sci-fi canon. Although the movie comes close, it ultimately falls short."
497,0,"Writer-director Gareth Edwards and his collaborator, Chris Weitz, have crafted a script which tries so hard to cover all the ethical dilemmas posed by the rise of artificial intelligence that I’m not sure what it’s meant to be saying."
498,1,"The anti-imperialist themes are thought-provoking, if a bit heavy-handed, but Edwards balances the anti-AI zealotry with explanations of AI violence toward humans."
499,1,"This film - like a lot of great sci-fi, says a lot while still managing to be highly entertaining and is quite a feast for the eyes."
500,1,"There may be a few teeny hiccups in the characters and plot of The Creator, but they do not take away from Edwards’ magnificent cinematic achievement."
501,1,"Somehow feels both old and new, familiar and unusual, an anomaly in a cinematic landscape that lacks originality, yet struggles to bring anything new to the table."
502,0,"Looks great, but the plot falls apart if you poke it and makes no attempt to grapple with AI’s potential. Instead it renders its robot people as a racialized Other in a clunky metaphor for bigotry."
503,1,"[A] pretty smart and highly entertaining spectacle with cool sci-fi concepts... [and] a truly gorgeous film, with big bold action sequences that could go toe to toe with the best of any big-budget franchise you can name."
504,0,"An atomic level of schmaltz. If you watch The Creator and end up wondering what on earth it is about, you will not be alone."
505,0,Edwards has decided to continue operating expensive toys without clearly knowing what he wants to do with them. [Full review in Spanish]
506,1,"Edwards returns to sci-fi as the backdrop for strange and displaced figures in the ambitious The Creator, and once again places a love story at its center... [Full review in Spanish]"
507,1,"While the character building is a bit simplistic and the pace rather frantic, the film works beautifully both in its action and the deeper themes and emotions."
508,1,"The Creator has all the technical elements needed to be a masterpiece but lacks the voice and focus needed to actually do something worthwhile with its potential leading to a mixed effort that while passable, is far from revolutionary."
509,1,"The Creator aspires to deliver a smart, humanist sci-fi tale and it succeeds just enough to make you realize the potential that was missed."
510,1,The Creator is a genial movie from a director that has a lot to offer. [Full review in Spanish]
511,1,"Ridley Scott’s film hovers over much of Edwards’s, but The Creator is one of the few Blade Runner remixes I’ve seen that not only invites but withstands the comparison without too much embarrassment. If only he had shaved it to the bone."
512,0,Say this for Edwards: there's enough talent on display that you keep rooting for him despite his repeated stumbles. Maybe next time he'll finally get it right.
513,1,"The Creator is sleek, but thoughtfully so. It’s impressive, but humble. The film is, to risk hyperbole, a true vision, a filmmaker reasserting their unique talent for spectacle."
514,0,"Particularly given the last AI-focused year, even though this film was written before we knew what a ChatGPT was, there was a real opportunity for this film to be exploratory and prescient. Instead, well, at least it looks fantastic."
515,1,What matters is that it works because Edwards has a true sense of vision beyond mere entertainment. He’s chasing after art while still spinning a good yarn.
516,1,"Despite the occasional sloppy messaging, “The Creator” remains a striking original work. The world Gareth Edwards has created is captivating and imaginative, full of evocative imagery and jaw-dropping spectacle."
517,0,"The Creator is a visually sumptuous and original sci-fi epic, but except for young Madeleine Yuna Voyles’s beautiful smile, the film never truly feels alive."
518,1,"While certainly nice to look at with neat designs and great action, it doesn’t explore A.I. relationships with humanity in a meaningful way and ends up feeling like a high-budget television movie setting the stage for a series that will never be."
519,1,"The Creator has all the ingredients to make a really great sci-fi film and honestly, it almost gets there. It has more than enough going for it to definitely recommend but I have a feeling many will pass this by."
520,0,There’s a strong vision here and a mesmerizing world. But there ultimately isn’t enough here to meet the potential.
521,1,"The creator of an original sci-fi odyssey, director Gareth Edwards’ visually stunning spectacle helps offset clunky dialogue and a potboiler plot which would otherwise render it obsolete."
522,1,"Not only does The Creator work as a good time at the movies, but it is also a reminder that mid-budget, (somewhat) original, crowd-pleasing stories can be told with aplomb."
523,1,"A remarkable achievement, and a persuasive argument in favour of carte blanche creative freedom for Edwards in whatever he chooses to do next."
524,0,There is no soul in this new machine.
525,1,"A sublime sensorial experience that immerses your senses into a beautifully realized sci-fi world. But a derivative story and uninspiring performances prevent this creation from truly impacting you, intellectually or emotionally. [Review in Spanish]"
526,1,"The Creator impresses visually, showcasing a promising concept. But, it falls short in emotional depth and character growth. While not fully there on a narrative level, it remains far from dull, especially on the expansive canvas of the big screen."
527,1,"A captivating story of humanity and love, showcasing the compassion that’s possible when someone doesn’t drown it out with fear and bias. This is a must-see movie and celebrates what original storytelling can look like when given the opportunity."
528,1,"When people bemoan the lack of new projects in Hollywood, which loves producing sequels and reboots more than some people love their own children, The Creator is exactly the kind of movie they’re missing."
529,1,"Gareth Edwards and his cinematographers create stunning sci-fi - but, basically, it's style over substance - as a plethora of gritty man vs. machine fighting sends viewers into a superficial stupor."
530,0,"Every director, it seems, gets a chance to take a big swing at this type of dystopia; while most of the results, like The Creator, are perfectly fine, few are all that memorable."
531,1,Gorgeously shot and conceived.
532,1,"The story is missing some connective tissue and follow through, but the imagery is so evocative that you don't always miss it. There's a textural richness to Edwards' scenes that few filmmakers can match."
533,1,"Dig beyond the immaculately created surface and you’ll find wasted potential. However, potential is potential, and Gareth Edwards does show that he has it if he can refine his own voice and not rely on existing tropes."
534,1,"Visually, The Creator rivals high budget Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and James Cameron movies. There are so times when the story does not meet the high goals the movie has set up for itself."
535,1,"In the hands of writer-director and sci-fi veteran Gareth Edwards, these familiar story notes feel almost renewed when combined with the dramatic visuals, creating an engrossing film experience that manages to show a little heart before its end."
536,0,"The stunning aesthetics notwithstanding, Garett Edwards' follow-up to ""Rogue One"" flounders on a confused, predictable, and frustratingly illogical script--committing the cardinal sin of sci-fi films of not sticking to the rules of its own universe"
537,0,"An original movie that's not original enough, a standalone movie that doesn't quite stand up. Despite spectacular visuals, some fascinating world-building and weighty, non-generic special effects, the overall story feels confused and slightly synthetic..."
538,1,Gareth Edwards’ The Creator is a derivative but dazzling sci-fi epic.
539,0,The best visual joke in The Creator? The subtle suggestion that AI humanoids might actually be smarter than humans. Even with literal holes in their heads.
540,0,"...if watching it [The Creator] as a cohesive narrative that has emotional depth or substantive quality, then it would fail to live up to even the lowest of expectations."
541,1,A visually arresting sci-fi that challenges us whether AI is truly the enemy. May not be groundbreaking narratively but there is plenty to admire in Gareth Edwards's passion project.
542,0,There is the slightly conspiratorial sense that the team behind this trip down movie-memory lane simply fed the scripts of various canonized sci-fi epics into an AI program and waited to see what sort of composite it spit out.
543,0,It is a visual feast without the feels.
544,1,"Gareth Edwards is more accomplished at world-building and orchestrating chaos than he is at developing characters, but the way the movie was made could be a game changer throughout Hollywood..."
545,1,"The Creator delivers in some style, with gun-toting robot hordes, massive machines of mass destruction, and the odd moment of quirky visual wit."
546,1,"Stirring if muddled, this ambitious and provocative cautionary tale offers rewards for both the eyes and the brain."
547,1,"An interesting adventure in a dystopian future, although it falls short when it comes to trying to reach the great successes of the science fiction genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
548,1,"Even if it is a somewhat convoluted and silly mishmash of familiar tropes and sci-fi cliches, it still evokes the feeling of something fresh, something novel, something exciting to experience and behold."
549,1,"The script’s not that good. But, visually, the film is another matter entirely, Edwards combining exotic location shooting with seamless CGI, endless invention and flair, to offer a staggering exercise in world-building."
550,1,It’s one of the most visually stunning and emotionally heart-wrenching movies of the year.
551,1,"The story of the journey that Joshua and Alpha take is compelling, hopeful, and stunningly realized. Time will tell if it enters the lexicon as one of the greatest films of its kind, but it’s certainly one of my favorite of the year."
552,0,"The Creator’s many impressive technical qualities are entirely mishandled, their import put above what a movie really needs: a good story."
553,0,"Where The Creator fails is in its script, which after some imaginative world-building in the first act careens first into joyless derring-do and then into heavy-handed political allegory."
554,0,"Sadly, Edwards and fellow screenwriter Chris Weitz make it more about the robots, technology, and whiz-bang dressing than they do about wanting us to fall in love with their characters."
555,1,The film could have easily been called Blue Beetle & His Amazing Family. The filmmakers are more concerned with the supporting players than the superhero they push to the background.
556,0,Practically everything related to the superhero saga is so formulaic that the dialogue track could get swapped with that of a dozen other superhero flicks and no one would know the difference. Where the film scores is in its moments dealing with family.
557,1,"If audiences still want movies as an art form a few years from now, and we end up with an inevitable wave of nostalgia for superhero films, it seems clear to me this one will be quickly reclaimed as an unsung classic of the genre."
558,1,"It’s ok for superhero stories to be fun, creative, and inviting, all things ""Blue Beetle"" is, suggesting that a future outing, should this film not be a oner in the new DCU, would not only be absolutely welcomed, it would shoot up to hotly-anticipated."
559,1,"The adventure of the first hero in the upcoming DCU, with its blend of humor, heart, and emotion in a Latin key, has become a strong contender to rise to the podium with the best comic book adaptations of the year."
560,0,"There's a sweet, important message in here about the importance of family, but sadly it's buried in a heavily cliched superhero flick whose beats you can list off well before they happen."
561,1,... What distinguishes Soto's work is the emotional honesty that is present in the work of his entire cast. [Full review in Spanish]
562,0,"Blue Beetle is a half-baked comedy and an even more pitiful melodrama about the importance of family. It feels aimless, as if it were cut down from under the knees before it started."
563,0,"Blue Beetle has moments that are plentifully enjoyed, overall when the humor works, although it does so at the cost of those clichés it supposedly aims to avoid.  [Full review in Spanish]"
564,1,That love that is so authentically Latino is a key element in the story. [Full review in Spanish]
565,1,Blue Beetle generates just enough goodwill to warrant a tepid recommendation.
566,1,"Blue Beetle is an amiable, sincere, and fitfully enjoyable piece in the superhero genre that entertains and engages in both thrills and poignancy thanks to its grounded approach and Soto’s focus on family over special effects. Recommended."
567,1,"Blue Beetle’s director, Angel Manuel Soto, and screenwriter, Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, could have concocted a family comedy with these engaging characters, eliminating the trite superhero theatrics, and they probably would have had a stronger film."
568,1,"Blue Beetle is charming, disposable pop entertainment. Not every film needs to be a apocalyptic spectacle."
569,1,"While the special effects are a little clunky here, the non-action scenes featuring Jaime’s funky family circle are invariably warm, inviting, and fun."
570,1,Gareth Dunnet-Alconer's screenplay has plenty of those big laughs and deserved bad-guy-comeuppances that slay in the hyped-up atmosphere of a large audience...
571,1,"The film serves up exactly what we now wearily expect, an over-egged slice of super-powered mulch with all the standard ingredients – blurs of action; overlong fight sequences; incoherent storytelling; and, of course, plenty of blue energy bolts."
572,0,"Director Angel Manuel Soto and writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer do their best to weave a few additional progressive elements into this basically routine production, evidently aimed at younger viewers."
573,1,"With a smaller scale and beautiful focus on character, family, and culture... a genuinely refreshing change of pace from all the bombastic, overblown superhero features... a passionate effort that might just stand as one of the best solo origin flicks."
574,1,Blue Beetle is a good time and proves that with the right blend of heart and passion the lesser-known superheroes can soar.
575,1,"… if you’re up for two and a bit hours of amiable character work, noisy action (with dodgy CGI), good representation but a one dimensional villain and zero surprises, you might find something to like in Blue Beetle."
576,1,"Blue Beetle won’t recharge the timeline, but in taking itself less seriously it provides a sense of levity to a genre so often bogged down in its own self-importance."
577,1,"If there’s a second movie, and that’s a big if, there’s a lot in Maridueña’s performance and the celebration of “la familia” that can be built on."
578,1,It's a great story about family... There were a couple of moments I completely forgot I was watching a superhero film. I just wanted to spend time with these people.
579,1,"Arrives with low expectations, but the film is a pleasant surprise."
580,0,"For me it's a bifurcated experience with this movie. I appreciated it from a ""la familia"" level, but on any kind of comic book, action-adventure level, I thought it was kind of subpar."
581,1,"I had a fun time and can't begrudge a movie giving Adriana Barraza, a great Mexican actress, a lot of cheesy lines to deliver."
582,1,Blue Beetle hits everything we could want in a comic book adaptation and easily surpassed my expectations!
583,1,Feels like something you've seen before but scrapes by thanks to the cast.
584,0,"By the time Blue Beetle’s end credits start rolling ahead of a pretty predictable mid-credits teaser, there’s a solid chance you’ll find yourself thinking that it would have been more memorable had Warner Bros. not taken so long to get it into theaters."
585,0,"The film is, in its last instance, wasted potential.  [Full review in Spanish]"
586,1,An adventurous superhero flick with the unique combination of family drama.
587,1,"The best film DC has put out in a while, 'Blue Beetle' offers fun, heartfelt action and comedy. Xolo Maridueña shines as Jaime Reyes, while director Ángel Manuel Soto succeeds in delivering an ode to Latin American culture in a superhero outfit."
588,1,"Ultimately, Blue Beetle reverts back to the tried-and-true superhero template."
589,1,Blue Beetle punches well above its weight visually; the effects are terrific and give the film a scale and spectacle the equal of any film in the genre with three times the cash available.
590,1,"While it plays like a lot of most superhero films, this still has its own unique charm and that's due to the style and culture that makes this a entertainment watch."
591,0,Formulaic and uninspiring family-orientated superhero DC comic book film.
592,1,"This superhero origin/adventure tale packs equal amounts of action, social commentary, family drama and Hispanic pride."
593,1,"Essentially Max Steel with a budget, but its charm remains."
594,1,"Mariduena’s charm keeps us hooked, while the positive message regarding the power of family is sincere and ultimately poignant. As a result, “Beetle” is able to keep superhero fatigue at bay, at least for two hours."
595,1,"This is one of the most low-key comic book films ever made. That laid back approach proves to be the film's strength, with ""Beetle"" one of the most charming surprises of the year."
596,1,"With an emotional family-focused core and some unique visual flourishes, it is a standout amongst recent superhero films."
597,1,"What makes Blue Beetle... more interesting than other typical superhero films is that Jaime isn’t tragic and he’s far from being alone. Despite their struggles, Jaime’s family are around him, supporting him and fighting with him from the very beginning."
598,0,A new superhero movie that never breaks away from the pack.
599,1,A hearty caper that flies above formulaic narrative and superhero fatigue.
600,1,"The charm is undeniable to the point that it's hard to not be happy with the film by the end...yet it has many noticeable issues that ultimately hold it back from being a memorable entry to the genre. High on potential, lower on execution."
601,1,"Blue Beetle has certain things going for it, even for what is ostensibly a by-numbers origins tale."
602,1,"Blue Beetle is one of the last films in the soon-to-be-defunct DC Extended Universe... It’s too late to salvage the series, but Soto deserves credit for creating one of the more charming entries in a mixed-bad franchise."
603,1,"In Soto’s hands, what would become a genuinely generic superhero story becomes a swell tribute to Mexican-American culture which filters its way from the reference-heavy dialogue to the style of the fight scenes."
604,1,"There's actually this battle not just between good and evil in the movie but also a little bit of class warfare that's going on, and that feels different than [other] superhero underdog stories."
605,1,This movie is really fun... The thing that makes this different from a lot of the big shiny noisy spectacles is that family element.
606,1,"The Reyes family are by far the best thing about this otherwise by-the-numbers caper. Funny, endearing and surprising, they recall the family in The Incredibles, and give the story its heart."
607,1,"At the heart of ""Blue Beetle"" are themes of family, community, gentrification, and corporate greed, all rolled into one unoriginal but fun flick."
608,1,It's such a shame that this movie will probably underperform because it's actually quite a fun time. The family dynamics really works and adds some heart to the thing. Please give us more.
609,1,A very charming superhero movie.
610,0,"Too silly, too cheesy and too obvious, Blue Beetle fails to pack a powerful punch when needed, especially when highlighting issues including elitism, racism, gentrification and ignorance."
611,1,BlueBeetle is enjoyable! A focus on family and Latin culture keeps the film grounded in heart. Xolo Maridueña is fantastic.  It can feel like Power Rangers at times but the third act is strong. It’s a mix between the first Shazam! and Ms. Marvel.
612,1,"BLUE BEETLE is one of those films that best exemplifies Roger Ebert's quote of ""it's now what a movie is about, it's how it's about it."""
613,0,Another DC Universe entry that is just too late in the rotation to stand out as anything but a simplistic rehash of old material that never fully takes advantage of the cultural relationships and surroundings that serve as the only identifying trademark.
614,1,"Blue Beetle was absolutely baller! it superseded my expectations with its heartfelt story , family dynamic and well directed action!"
615,1,Blue Beetle has a distinctive creative voice that needs to be heard. The Reyes family is a wonderful addition to the cinematic comic book canon.
616,1,"Submit to the fun fast-paced romp and you'll find it to be one of the more engaging movies of the summer. Its blend of fun, heart, and important representation make this one a real winner."
617,1,"Blue Beetle is both scrappy and tailored, poignant and breezily amusing. Pitched from a new angle and guided by talented hands, Blue Beetle is a rarity in these superhero end-times: a genuine pleasure to watch, reviving tired old formula with brio."
618,1,"This is an origin story for the titular character, paired with a one-off adventure. No more, no less. And all things considered, it’s not bad."
619,1,"This light-hearted, clever B-movie steeped in Latino culture is a more appealing superhero future than another Gothic Gotterdammerung."
620,1,"For a comic book superhero blockbuster, this movie has an unusual sense of peril in its action scenes, largely because it takes the time to develop its characters and their connections with each other."
621,1,This one’s for the kids.
622,1,"With thrilling visual effects action and a touching cultural look at family, the film introduces one of the genres coolest and most relatable superheroes yet."
623,1,"The Reyes family are the heart and soul of Blue Beetle.  George Lopez's Mexican Doc Brown, Adriana Barraza's revolutionary Nana and Susan Sarandon as a villain are fire! This film leaves the sweetest sting ever!"
624,0,"While Blue Beetle has plenty of heart and a fresh perspective, the villains and the heroes are a forgettable blend of standard comic book fare that’s never as interesting as the movie’s relaxed, warm, and loving scenes where this DC film lives."
625,0,"Largely good natured and charmingly Mexican-flavored, it's also crucially lacking in coherent action set pieces. And so it's a bit like a cup full of drywall insulation covered with Tajín and Chamoy."
626,1,Gather the family for this fun-filled adventure chock-full of laughs and plenty of heart. Xolo Maridueña and George Lopez lead the solid cast which also includes the great Adriana Barraza as the scene-stealing Nana.
627,1,"Worth seeing, but with many missed opportunities."
628,1,"Despite the ongoing talk about superhero fatigue setting in, Blue Beetle is very enjoyable by doing what it’s supposed to but with new, smarter approaches."
629,1,"Even if it is the cinematic equivalent of microwaved leftovers, Blue Beetle is generally a good time, largely thanks to Xolo Maridueña."
630,1,You can keep Marvel’s Avengers and DC’s Justice League. The Reyes family is the only superhero team we want right now.
631,0,"On the surface, it's entertaining to see the references to Mexican culture and enjoy a varied (and very Latino) soundtrack, but apart from that (and the solid central performances), “Blue Beetle” doesn't offer much. Full review in Spanish."
632,1,"The superhero genre is a little bit crowded, and while I think I'm not sure if this is anything hugely different from the many others, it is entertaining.. It has a lot of funny moments, and the action is well choreographed."
633,1,Sometimes it’s better to keep it simple. The layup will suffice to build momentum besides the 360 Tomahawk dunk. 'Blue Beetle' provides just enough juice for a franchise seeking nourishment.
634,1,I did not expect to cry during Blue Beetle. Twice...I was not ready for a film that not only delivers a solid superhero origin story but does so with a tremendous amount of heart and sincerity.
635,1,"The actors were funny and lovable, but the Blue Beetle’s real enemy in this movie was the stereotypical Hollywood trope.  I really wanted to love Blue Beetle. I really did."
636,1,Most of the superhero elements in Blue Beetle is stuff we see on a weekly basis now. Jaime's family is full of personality and elevates the film above average.
637,1,"Blue Beetle as a superhero is something that can be enjoyed by everyone in equal measure, Blue Beetle the movie is something that will especially connect with Latine audiences."
638,0,it's difficult to imagine Blue Beetle becoming one of the comic book movies that is remembered a few years — or even six months — down the line.
639,1,"It’s like the movie is screaming for Blue Beetle to be a hero for La Gente (The People), but it didn’t want to lean too hard on that so as not to scare the white audience and instead, subbed in the soft-ball Shazam stuff."
640,1,"Blue Beetle features some fun action sequences, a fantastic score, and a charismatic performance from Xolo Maridueña. Susan Sarandon plays a throwaway villain, but the movie thrives when this wonderful family is on screen."
641,1,"Blue Beetle is a fun and funny film that celebrates the Latin culture in authentic ways while also delivering an engaging, thrilling & touching superhero movie! Xolo Maridueña delivers a star making turn under the confident direction of Angel Manuel Soto."
642,0,Blue Beetle progresses into an aggressively generic and padded-out midsection that slowly-but-surely drains the viewer’s interest and attention...
643,1,"This is, first and foremost, fun – and it wouldn’t be half as much fun were it not for the boisterous dinner-table vibe that drives the film."
644,1,"An exciting, fun, and wholesome superhero origin..."
645,1,"A funny, heartfelt and culturally-significant entry into the superhero genre. With family at its center, the film’s true superheroes are the Reyes family."
646,1,"Charm and personality do a lot to help this. It feels oddly dated; such a young, fresh character deserved a fresher movie."
647,1,"Soto shoots all of the action clearly and knows when to end a sequence too, be it action or comedy. It’s deftly made, never wearing out its welcome, and how many superhero films can you say that about these days?"
648,0,"Blue Beetle is a hollow, uninspired recycling of superhero tropes. Every idea, both significant and inconsequential, is lifted from works that are just as formulaic and tired as it is."
649,1,"With plenty of heart and fun, DC’s Blue Beetle ushers in an exciting new hero for the big screen, and if this is a sign of things to come in DC’s new chapter, then it’s a step in the right direction."
650,1,"Yes, this is but another CGI heavy superhero origin story about a young guy accidentally acquiring superpowers and awkwardly learning how to deal with them. But the refreshing spirit to be found in this young guy's family redeems the whole movie."
651,1,"Blue Beetle embarks on a deeply emotional journey intricately woven with engaging family dynamics. Despite the standard superhero tropes, the movie’s charisma and sentimental depth converge to create a compelling theatrical experience."
652,1,"A dynamic superhero origin story about the power of family, full of references to Mexican culture and values. [Full Review in Spanish]"
653,1,"While Blue Beetle may not introduce anything novel to the comic book genre, its hero's connection to a tightly-knit, lovable Latino family stands as its greatest asset."
654,1,This film follows the same old superhero formula. One difference is that it emotionally draws heavily on the culture of Mexican family to create the backstory of the characters’ motivation.
655,1,"It does what more Latin American horror pictures should do: move away from the Hollywood conventions and clichés of the genre, and take advantage of local stories and superstitions to develop an original and surprising story. Full review in Spanish."
656,1,A memorable feature you need to forget about when you're going to sleep. [Full review in Spanish]
657,1,A horrifying film that preys on the fears inside of its characters.
658,1,"If “The Exorcist: Believer” (2023) made you lose faith in possession movies, this Argentinean horror film will restore it, as it features the most merciless, mean-spirited Mephistophelian invader since “Hereditary” (2018)."
659,1,"In Argentina, the horror genre usually travels along predictable paths - as it happens everywhere in the world, in fact - so When Evil Lurks is like water in the desert. [Full review in Spanish]"
660,1,Is this a political allegory of our times? [Full review in Spanish]
661,1,"Rugna once again gives us a glut of horrifying imagery and intense sequences, but this time with the addition of character depth and a story that is well-constructed though not without its flaws."
662,1,"In an Argentine cinema where horror films tend to be too predictable, built with few and already well-trodden ideas, Rugna boasts immense dramatic and visual imagery. [Full review in Spanish]"
663,1,Yikes!
664,1,The original horror film is not for everyone and especially not for those unable to watch children mauled by mad dogs without turning purple.
665,1,"Nobody is safe from the unnamed, unseen evil that wreaks havoc on a rural Argentine town in this buzzy new horror film."
666,1,"The movie is very inventive in the horrific, oozing retribution it allows its characters to inflict on themselves."
667,1,At no point in “When Evil Lurks” will the viewer feel like this is a bad film.
668,1,"After having two thrilling viewings of Demián Rugna’s chilling, gory and incredibly tense tale of demonic possession, the odds are stacked against a stronger horror presenting itself in 2023."
669,1,"When Evil Lurks is inspired and immersive, thoughtfully composed visually, and, most importantly, crazy as hell."
670,1,"Kind of a zombie movie and kind of a demon-possession movie, though also quite unlike anything you'd expect from those genres, this potent chiller is truly shocking, as well as clever and knowing."
671,1,[A] visceral horror experience.
672,1,Demián Rugna’s film is purpose built to shatter the viewer and leave them with nothing to hold on to but encompassing misery.
673,1,"A possession thriller unlike any that you’ve likely seen before... It's one of the boldest, most viscerally intense, and unpredictable horror movies of the year."
674,1,"The visceral <i>meatiness</i> of this demonic-possession–infectious-zombie combo hits like a blow. The social and political context for the grotesquerie is even more appalling, and so very pertinent."
675,1,"It is wild, chaotic, disturbing, and big F***- those kids' energy. I was disgusted and leaning forward. It's my favorite movie to hit Shudder this year (so far). The intensity and violence had me on the edge of my seat.  People to watch it immediately."
676,1,"This Argentinean exorcism film from writer/director Demián Rugna manages to one-up ""The Exorcist: Believer"" in every conceivable way."
677,1,"This creepy premise makes this film lights out scary, with lotsa gore & horrific death scenes. And this all seems what horror fans want the most, including the inevitable solution that’s not a solution at all. An unsettling fright-fest for for Halloween."
678,1,‘When Evil Lurks’ is a disturbing waltz of brutality and madness and a welcome scream-at-the-screen addition to the extreme horror cannon.
679,1,"Bleak – but also physical, noisy, bloody, exciting and fresh."
680,1,"A demonic-possession movie set in a post-God world, a land of the damned upon which evil flourishes within a creation gone rotten."
681,1,"It's not going to be for everyone, but if you've got the stomach for it, then 'When Evil Lurks' is easily among the year's most gruesome, unrelenting, and unforgettable horrors."
682,1,"When Evil Lurks is a shocking yet highly accomplished horror film, and Rugna’s name is one that demands to be up there with Cronenberg, Romero, Carpenter and Argento – this is a true master of the genre."
683,1,"It’s breathlessly paced, sprints through a fleet 99 minutes and will give your nerves a big workout."
684,1,"When Evil Lurks can’t quite sustain its impressive escalation... But if your Halloween watchlist needs a sick new heart and brain breaker, try a movie that’s liberal with its entrails."
685,1,"I’d be hard pressed to call [it] a masterpiece, but it sure is a great horror film."
686,1,"When Evil Lurks is nasty, chilling, shocking, and so damn effective. Another example of why foreign-language horror should not be overlooked - there’s a fearlessness, a ferocity, and a voice here that is often missing from Hollywood horror."
687,1,"'When Evil Lurks' is a new take on the possession sub-genre of horror. It's intense and unrelenting. With that said, it may be too much for viewers looking for a less tragic and uncomfortable watch. It is not for the faint of heart."
688,1,"In a time where mediocre productions such as The Exorcist: Believer (2023) frequently make it up on the Marquis, this movie returns the genre to where it should be. [Full review in Spanish]"
689,1,"A demonic thriller that’s unrelenting as it is incredibly disturbing, Demián Rugna’s “When Evil Lurks” is the movie “The Exorcist: Believer” thinks it was."
690,1,"A nihilistic and nasty thriller that manipulates known tropes of the possession drama to tell a post-pandemic story with an unbridled willingness to go there with its depictions of violence, particularly against children."
691,1,"A very unique and interesting take on a possession situation that I wished was more fleshed out, but it is one of the most disturbing movies you'll EVER see."
692,1,"Rugna’s When Evil Lurks is a freaky ride for the duration, and perhaps that’s enough."
693,1,For those stalwart genre fans looking to raise the bar ... it will likely be a must-see.
694,1,"When Evil Lurks is a tense and relentless movie. It never hesitates when portraying extreme situations thru Horror and Fantasy, ultimately tapping into darker aspects of the human condition such as rage, selfishness and the fear of the unknown."
695,1,"When Evil Lurks is a capital “H” horror film that risks it all and hits the jackpot, pummeling its audience into submissions and still leaving us asking for more."
696,1,When Evil Lurks is full of images I will never shake because they’ve been delivered via the cinematic equivalent of a hypodermic needle. Demián Rugna is the truth. All hail.
697,1,"Demián Rugna has crafted not only the best “feel bad” horror film of the year, but a uniquely brutal possession film that ditches the genre's usual religious jargon in favor of a viral twist."
698,1,"The film’s breathless pace creates a sense of hopeless brutality that it follows to its logical conclusion. Even with the renewed interest in horror over recent years, few films have the courage and single-mindedness to be this mean-spirited."
699,1,Demián Rugna’s harrowing film spares no one from the cruelty of its world.
700,1,Argentine writer-director Demián Rugna follows up Terrified with an equally petrifying new tale.
701,1,It’s a strong contender for the year’s best terror for its cold touch that lingers and feels soaked in the Devil’s bathwater.
702,1,"In a genre full of hack filmmakers, [Demián Rugna is] a distinctive talent, and When Evil Lurks is evidence of how far he’s willing to go."
703,1,"Director Demián Rugna does a superb job combining unpleasant makeup and prosthetics, an ever-present sense of dread and disturbing imagery."
704,1,"A lack of safety, indicated early on by some twisted acts, will keep the viewers on their toes, along with just having Argentinian actors who do not exist in the same realm as manicured movie stars."
705,1,"Sometimes crude...But Demián Rugna...plops us into this world unprepared, and turns our vague unease into genuine shocks when the violence comes"
706,1,A masterful work of horror that tackles the possession genre from a fresh perspective. Not for the faint of heart. It leaves you with images of horror that will remain forever embedded in your psyche.
707,1,"Grim and gruesomely effective, When Evil Lurks takes audiences on a disturbing ride to a destination they may fear to go."
708,1,"Rugna could have elected to take the easy way out, but carved out his tense path to a place of no return."
709,1,"The film carries us from a carefree existence made possible by not paying attention, to a crushing tragedy."
710,1,When Evil Lurks is memorably unnerving.
711,1,When Evil Lurks isn’t just a grim and nightmarish cautionary tale – it’s also insanely fun.
712,1,"It’s demons galore in the horror genre these days, and there seems to be what you could call “possession fatigue.” While most of these films hit tired beats, Demián Rugna’s When Evil Lurks is an original experience."
713,1,"The tension is heightened not with cheap jump scares, but with truly terrifying story elements. Filled with harsh, graphic imagery that will haunt you forever, this isn’t a film that relies on the easy scare, but one that is legitimately disturbing."
714,1,"Argentinian filmmaker Demián Rugna returns with When Evil Lurks, easily his most ambitious and polished effort to date. It’s one of the most viciously cruel and deeply unsettling motion pictures I’ve seen in all of 2023."
715,1,"When Evil Lurks doesn't shy away from the horrific, keeping viewers on edge with a surplus of discomforting moments. It's bold and intensely bleak, and it is one of my favorite horror films of the year"
716,1,"Rugna’s taken demonic possession, that increasingly threadbare horror trope, and twisted it around until he found his own angle of attack. He’s interested in two things: dread and dubious Satan-fighting advice."
717,1,Argentinean writer-director Demián Rugna's powerfully unsettling horror film When Evil Lurks is not for the faint of heart or faint of stomach.
718,1,"Excels when employing the horrifying and macabre practical effects, full of realistic stomach-turning gore. The story is mildly intriguing, but the progression is a little chaotic, leading to a convoluted narrative that doesn’t stick to its own rules."
719,1,"If Terrified was a film that built tremendous suspense, When Evil Lurks uses gore and shock to force the audience into submission."
720,1,"It never lacks the conviction, style or sardonic wit needed to make [its] flaws seem incidental to what’s overall a pretty bracing ride."
721,1,"If this Halloween season, you're looking for a new movie that is not only scary but will f*ck you up, you can't do better than When Evil Lurks."
722,1,Demián Rugna’s post- and pre-apocalyptic chiller imagines the demonic dissolution of the family in a godless world
723,0,"When Evil Lurks could have worked so well as a black comedy. Unfortunately, it wants to be taken seriously, and I cannot."
724,1,When Evil Lurks brings a fresh and unique spin on the demon possession subgenre. The sudden explosions of gore & violence are visceral and shocking while the story always keeps you guessing on where things are headed. Buckle up!
725,1,"This is a magnificently written piece of horror, and Rugna’s expansive direction gives it an otherworldly yet dirty, earthy presence."
726,1,"Heads up, sickos. If you’re looking for an uncompromising, no-one-is-safe horror movie that’ll make you squirm, “When Evil Lurks” is the film for you."
727,1,"When Evil Lurks is genuinely frightening beyond its violence, because this is as much a story about people dealing with uncertainty and terror as it is about the shocks..."
728,1,A creepy-as-all-get-out Argentinian demonic horror/thriller that offers plenty of fresh meat to a chewed-over genre.
729,1,"This is a dark and timely parable about what happens when trust — among community members, within families, between a government and its people — disintegrates."
730,1,"Delivering scares at a pace that rarely allows one to catch their breath, and with enough gruesome surprises to consistently startle."
731,1,"Whether you’re meeting it on a completely superficial level, or digging in deeper, confronting its religious-tinged brutality and sobering meta-context, the provocative portrait painted is terrifically horrifying."
732,1,"The addition of a new character in the second half of When Evil Lurks takes away almost all of the chaos that makes things so horrifyingly charming. The next shocking scene is never too far away making sure the movie never gets too stale, however."
733,1,A no-holds-barred demon-slaying nightmare of blood and guts and unstoppable evil.
734,1,"It’s a fresh take on the possession film, and it uses the audience’s familiarity with certain tropes only as a jumping off point."
735,1,"It is a gory and, at times, very unsettling watch, but Rugna has a striking vision that stands apart in the overstuffed demonic possession sub-genre."
736,1,"Relentlessly dark, disturbing and palpably scary, but also somewhat exhausting and repetitive."
737,1,"When Evil Lurks takes no prisoners as a horror film where innocence is either non-existent or ineffective against the dark, and Pablo Fuu‘s score helps drive the energy and the horror towards that abyss."
738,1,Rugna takes a certain amount of glee in barreling past the line of good taste... steadily ratcheting up tension only to have scenes explode in easily anticipated but still nearly photorealistic graphic violence.
739,1,When Evil Lurks proves itself a visceral horror that will get under your skin.
740,1,"If there's a place where it stumbles, it's in the fact that this ever-evolving ""evil"" is the subject of expansive lore and rules. Its conclusion is satisfying, especially if you've been paying attention to every little twitch and sputter that is shown."
741,1,It stays on the right side of WTF just enough to WTF you up
742,1,When Evil Lurks is uniquely grisly.
743,1,Horror filmmaker Demián Rugna (Terrified) returns with a tale of rapidly spreading demonic possession in When Evil Lurks.
744,1,"A hectic mix of carnage, mayhem and gore, When Evil Lurks will have viewers laughing, crying, and quite possibly throwing up as well."
745,1,"Vibrant characters, grotesque body horror, and swift and utterly breathtaking violence make this film an excruciatingly spine-chilling, mind-melting, and ultimately heartbreaking experience. Rugna’s Latino and macabre sense of humor is always at work."
746,1,"When Evil Lurks is a shocking, mean-spirited possession film pumped with one jaw-dropping spike of violence after another."
747,1,There's enough unforgettable imagery in “When Evil Lurks” to overcome its unfulfilled potential.
748,1,"It generates an eerie atmosphere as the evil unleashed by the possessed seeps into everything and viewers anxiously await the next horror, which Rugna delivers with terrible verve."
749,1,Rugna once again delivers a shocking and sinister descent into depravity guaranteed to shake viewers to their core.
750,1,This is a delightfully brutal horror film where stress is the name of the game as it takes a classic possession story and twists it into more decidedly macabre territory. It demands its pound of flesh and comes away with more than its bloody share.
751,1,There are set pieces in this film that will haunt us for the rest of our days. There is violence so casually executed that we cannot stop thinking about it. Trust us when we say that When Evil Lurks will shake you to your core.
752,1,"The central theme of infectious evil and a gruesome commitment to gore carries Rugna's latest far, making for a Halloween season treat."
753,1,The enthralling mystery at the heart of Mister Organ is the way Farrier establishes that there is nothing there to Organ—he calls him a “black hole” at one point—while being unable to stop himself from getting caught up in the man’s grievances.
754,1,Mister Organ is the kind of documentary one needs to experience along with Farrier. When Farrier isn’t feeling as threatened as he should a new piece of information pops up to expand on Organ’s grip over people and the numerous ways he has ruined lives
755,1,An unhinged character study.
756,1,"It feels taxing in some way to even watch the movie—like, great, now I need to go through life knowing he exists. What can I do to avoid him?"
757,1,"This is someone who sucks the life out of you, but it makes for a hell of an interesting documentary. Mister Organ is fantastic."
758,1,David Farrier’s latest documentary Mister Organ is perhaps scarier than any horror movie as it paints a portrait of a real-life narcissist.
759,1,It’s a gripping yarn fuelled by larger than life figures and twists upon twists without making light of serious material.
760,1,"Another New Zealand-based exploration of weird behavior, although this time it’s centered around the behavior of a specific guy."
761,1,It's less an examination of the psyche of one man than a PSA about manipulators.
762,1,Mister Organ is a chilling work that will have viewers cautiously looking over their shoulders and screening their phone calls after leaving the theatre.
763,1,"At the risk of his sanity, Farrier has bottled one of the darkest ways a law-abiding human can be made."
764,1,"Farrier doesn’t offer a tidy conclusion or many answers; however, his film is irresistible and gripping. It’s also a warning."
765,1,"Mister Organ is unhinged chaos; Michael Organ is a black hole, and David Farrier has fallen into it."
766,1,Farrier eloquently captures and transports the audience into the state of infuriation and mania he must've felt during filming. Organ is a psychological terror who weaves an entrancing spell. A riveting and disturbing watch.
767,1,It's the kind of story that might need a trigger warning for viewers who have fallen victim to manipulators like Organ. And it's a journey that can't help but draw you into its web of deceit—coercive and fatigued alike.
768,1,"It’s a long, hard ninety minutes, even with someone as charming as Farrier leading the charge, but that ultimately feels like the point — that minutes turn to hours with Michael Organ."
769,1,"Mister Organ is the kind of documentary that makes you sit there with your mouth agape, stunned by what you’re witnessing."
770,1,"Farrier may regret this experience, but regardless, it's compelling..."
771,1,"If its title, “Mister Organ,” initially strikes you as humorous, you won’t be laughing long."
772,1,"Farrier’s frustrations spill off the screen and give the viewer the same anxiety the reporter feels, the same anxiety anyone shares who knows something about facing down a lying, harassing, bullying moron who won’t leave you be."
773,0,"Mister Organ is a portrait of Michael Organ, a man who has been wreaking havoc throughout the “Beverly Hills of Auckland.” It’s David’s own pride that keeps him here long after the audience wishes he would put away the camera."
774,1,"Entertaining in the way the true crime documentary genre has blossomed, addictively, in the past decade or two. But it also captures the exhausting and petty banality of its main subject."
775,1,"Mister Organ is a tangled web of deceit, devious dealing, and death. In many ways, it's a document of a tragedy in progress and a warning beacon to everyone in all of New Zealand to avoid it's subject at all costs."
776,1,"Like Farrier’s previous documentary Tickled, Mister Organ takes viewers down one garden path before veering sharply down a darker, far more twisty road — a chilling, personal account of a man who sinks his claws into you and refuses to let go."
777,1,"Somehow, Farrier continually finds himself involved in the strangest stories imaginable. Much of Mister Organ feels like he's reckoning with his own poor decision-making."
778,1,"Part of what makes Mister Organ such a rich text is that it isn’t just a portrait of a strange man. It’s also a portrait of the documentarian, a film about its own filming... [it's] funny and strange, thrilling and sad."
779,1,"As much as the credits roll before all of the answers are forthcoming, Farrier is able to engender interest in this character, and in how his personal story began to overlap with his subject’s."
780,1,"Mister Organ is an early contender for the most jaw-dropping and entertaining doc of the year, moving briskly and never outstaying its welcome."
781,1,"Ultimately, Mister Organ is a fascinating – and hilarious – look at one man’s rampant narcissism and how it affects those he comes into contact with."
782,1,"If you haven’t knowingly observed a narcissist before, this may well make for fascinating and, indeed, cautionary viewing."
783,1,"Although [Farrier's] latest film doesn’t have the same degree of shocking twists and turns as [Tickled], viewers will nevertheless find a fiendish stranger-than-fiction story about a central figure who’s more urban legend than man."
784,1,"David Farrier’s documentary feature is a study in sociopathy, as the filmmaker and his gaslighting subject play mind games"
785,1,"Another disturbing, perplexing, larger-than-life yet unshakeably authentic slice of life, and another piece of proof that humanity's worst impulses will always seep out any way they can."
786,1,"Mister Organ is everything you are hoping it will be. This is a dark, compelling, bleakly hilarious and -- at times -- disturbing film."
787,1,"Once again, Farrier has somehow attracted - or been attracted to (it’s hard to tell) - another unbelievable real life character that is fascinating and mesmerising in the worst ways possible."
788,1,"It's one of the best-looking documentaries ever made in this country-cinematographer Dominic Fryer actually manages to do something new and interesting with 1:1 interviews, and certain locations take on a truly sinister quality thanks to creative framing."
789,1,"Mister Organ is a remarkable film: A comedic horror of a documentary, a simple piece of investigative journalism descending into madness, and a spotlight on the human spirit’s capacity for darkness."
790,1,"""Mister Organ” deserves attention."
791,0,"Mister Organ offers a somewhat lucid glimpse of the danger that people like him pose to the public. If only it didn’t feel like Farrier himself were standing on the outside looking in, perhaps Mister Organ could have offered more than just a glimpse."
792,1,"Mister Organ is a riveting, tense examination of when something is so fascinating that it might not be worth poking around in order to just not wake up a dangerous sleeping bear."
793,1,"By the time things end, Ferrier and the audience have been on an out of control ride that is frightening and taxing. Ferrier shows vulnerability in allowing the audience get so immersed in this work and the toll it is taking on him."
794,1,Fascinating and highly disturbing.
795,1,It will both shock and amuse in equal measure.
796,1,"By the time things end, Ferrier and the audience have been on an out of control ride that is frightening and taxing. Ferrier shows vulnerability in allowing the audience get so immersed in this work and the toll it is taking on him."
797,1,Fascinating and highly disturbing.
798,1,It will both shock and amuse in equal measure.
799,1,"By the time things end, Ferrier and the audience have been on an out of control ride that is frightening and taxing. Ferrier shows vulnerability in allowing the audience get so immersed in this work and the toll it is taking on him."
800,1,Fascinating and highly disturbing.
801,1,It will both shock and amuse in equal measure.
802,1,"A troubling, somber study, but one shot through with dark, edgy humor that sneaks up on you.  The result is funny, unsettling and poignant by turns, but still feeling all of a piece rather than a disjointed composite."
803,1,"Todd Haynes’ provocative drama is full of questions. After watching it, I’ve got a few of my own."
804,1,"May December is a thought-provoking, multilayered exploration of voyeuristic tabloid culture and a complex character study of a man whose childhood was taken away too soon. The film features three of the best performances of the year, especially Melton."
805,1,"Todd Haynes will make you feel for the characters long after the credits end.  See it with friends and then get ready to talk, argue, dream and scheme about where the characters go next.  There will be Oscar nominations. There should be Oscar wins."
806,1,"Haynes' two main characters provide twice as much opportunity to plunge the depths of human emotion and complex histories, and he does so in heartbreaking, fascinating ways."
807,1,"May December, Todd Hayne’s riveting, comic, yet poignant look at the ghoulish curiosity of the human mind, the blurring of lines between performance and feeling, and the moral red lines we cross to achieve our desires."
808,0,Applying a smattering of unlikely kinks and a confounding third act of insecurity swerves sinks the film. Haynes is left with a mood piece of examining taboo with more taboo. and it gets unattractively lost in just that very vibe.
809,1,"Despite the high controversy of the central theme, the black comedy peeks shamelessly throughout the script co-written by Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik. [Full review in Spanish]"
810,1,"Portman and Moore give sensitive, thoughtful performances in a Persona-like meditation on identity, agency, trauma, boundaries, and the gulf between the way we want to be seen and the need to be known for who we are."
811,1,"a gripping very femme-centric drama scripted by Samy Burch, directed by Todd Haynes and starring Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore as utterly fascinating women, revealing in turn their sparring personalities and counterpoint objectives."
812,1,"First time screenwriter, Samy Burch taps into a vibe of horror meets soap opera as she explores a May – December relationship that mimics that of Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Fualaau’s illegal love affair and then lawful marriage from the late 1990’s."
813,1,All three leads of May December know exactly the tone that Todd Haynes’ has set for them. It’s a fascinating probe taking the viewer on a different mindset then you’d expect from this story.
814,1,"Todd Haynes' May December is about the ugliness that permeates human nature, and our leanings towards the salacious, practically ignoring the very real people at the centre of it all."
815,1,Portman and Moore deliver a master class in acting during every scene they inhabit. What becomes a case of opposites slowly turns into personalities melding together.
816,0,"If May December is meant to be a critique of media exploitation and the public’s voracious appetite for sexual scandal, it’s trying to have its cake and eat it too."
817,1,"And that’s Haynes’s film: two lionesses licking their lips while they apply each other’s make-up. It’s a strange film, a little chilly, veering between black comedy and zoned-out melodrama..."
818,1,"May December works best as a dark comedy, a portrait of the American suburbs hungry for gossip and cobblers but unwilling to grapple with tough conversations."
819,1,Engaging and sincere as an exploration of what the artistic process even means in the face of strange human tragedy.
820,1,"Ultimately, it’s a work of art to be admired more than adored, and the end result is an emotionally hollow experience. But that’s not to say that it won’t make you chuckle at a host of characters oblivious to the irony of their actions."
821,1,"May December is a trick of a movie, and it doesn’t hide it."
822,1,Anybody looking for something off the beaten path - but not too off - will appreciate the subtle underlying humor and cleverly stylized performances.
823,1,"Serpentine in its plotting, queasily unsettling in its subject matter, and very, very funny, Todd Haynes’s latest picture is as deft a tonal juggling act as you will see anywhere this year."
824,1,It’s a little as if Bergman’s “Persona” had been remade by the Real Housewives of Savannah.
825,1,"Much like the gossip-laden tabloids that spawned the latest from director Todd Haynes, his fifth screen collaboration with Julianne Moore flashes a clunky quality that works both for and against it."
826,1,"Todd Haynes’ new movie is one nasty piece of fun...Funny, but quite vicious."
827,1,"Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore lock horns in this small town melodrama, that see-saws between intimate character study and intriguing love triangle, propelled along by powerhouse performances."
828,1,"We’re left with plaguing questions that challenge what we hold dear: our entertainment, our source of empowerment, our safety."
829,0,It unfortunately becomes muddled and can’t decide what it is trying to say
830,1,The Joe-Gracie dynamic is like Gus Van Sant’s To Die For; the Elizabeth-Gracie clash recalls Ingmar Bergman’s Persona. The result is a creepy master class in acting.
831,1,"May December is a film that leads you to feel one thing, only to immediately make you question whether you are complicit -- a bad person, even -- for feeling it."
832,1,This film masterfully handles its various tones of feeling uncomfortable to laughing at the melodramatic moments almost perfectly. Moore and Portman are both sensational but Charles Melton is outstanding in this very difficult and complex role.
833,1,One of Haynes' most unbalancing and provocative films.
834,1,"Picking up where the tabloids usually leave off, this well-acted character study navigates morally unsettling territory with an assured balance of melodrama and biting satirical edge."
835,1,"it’s a film that draws great drama from a tabloid-inspired premise, with both lead actresses selling the hell out of it."
836,1,"Twinged with dark comedy that, combined with the trauma of these characters, manifests in a camp-infused drama, the balance of tone and atmosphere is superb."
837,1,"A twisty psychodrama that nods to both the upper-middle-class soap operatics of his own Far From Heaven and the identity-blurring gamesmanship likes of Bergman’s Persona, while waxing more caustic than either."
838,1,"Todd Haynes' tweak of the Mary Kay Letourneau case is half-campy, half-serious and just strange enough to work"
839,1,"May December is pretty and alluring, but if you start to look a little closer, you see the darkness and the ugliness that has been there all along."
840,1,Haynes carefully constructs a cinematic world in May December where the environment reflects (and perhaps inspires) the characters' feelings.
841,1,"May December exists in an uncomfortable realm. Haynes isn’t afraid of that, and American movies are better for it."
842,1,"It really is one of the thorniest, most thought-provoking movies you’ll see this year. But it’s difficult not to walk away feeling like the film itself is as stunted as Melton’s man-child..."
843,1,"An interesting exercise, but lacking in Haynes' magic."
844,1,"Absorbing and quietly challenging, May December engages us in a pursuit similar to the one Elizabeth undertakes."
845,1,"Haynes, Moore and Portman deliver tabloid camp couture."
846,1,The result is a complex character study that demands we not lose sight of the layers involved. You don't have to vilify or champion anyone to do so either. Stop short and consider where happiness meets contentment and acceptance meets defeat
847,1,What would make a grown woman have sex with a 12-year-old boy? You'll be thrown thrillingly off balance with peak acting from Julianne Moore and Charles Melton as the lovers and Natalie Portman as the actress eager to go Hollywood with their squirmy tale.
848,1,"It’s kinda funny, kinda nasty, weirdly heartfelt, and entirely one of Haynes’ absolute best."
849,1,"Although not on the same level as Haynes’ best movie (2015’s Carol), this one highlights the director’s ability to explore complex and dysfunctional human relationships with insight and intelligence."
850,1,"In its refusal to flatten out the bumps of its situation to promote a slogan or a cause, it’s a model to all of those self-satisfied message movies that confuse repeating favored clichés with artistry and reduce character to talking points."
851,1,"Joe, and Melton, might be the biggest masterstroke of May December. Scandalous fun and camp are, you imagine, relatively easy with performers like this. But to give it a soul, too? It makes it monumental."
852,1,"A melodramatic campy satire on tabloid stories, character studies, crime docs, & specifically Method Acting. Haynes really delivers with something so unexpected.  Portman & Moore are just Impeccable but Charles Melton gives a sincere standout performance"
853,1,May December loses some of its hypnotic weirdness – but it becomes a more emotionally rewarding film for it.
854,1,"Haynes, working from a smart, layered script by Samy Burch, comes at this material from a fascinating angle."
855,1,"May December, a prickly story about performance and persuasion, about prejudgments and predation, is a triumph."
856,1,"Watching Portman watch Moore, and Moore watch her back, is fascinating."
857,1,"A delightful piece of ironic, darkly funny, and occasionally thrilling melodrama. Wrought with moral ambiguities and several outstanding performances, this ranks among Haynes’ best films."
858,1,The filmmakers ... elevate that drama by constantly poking and prodding at their film's existence.
859,1,"The three leads are phenomenal, Portman’s husky come-ons amusing in their brazenness and revelatory in their application, her direct camera reading of Gracie’s love letter the film’s climactic assumption of character."
860,1,Thrillingly discombobulating. One of the best films of the year.
861,1,A ripped-from-the-tabloids confection that feels like a Lifetime TV movie reimagined by an early-career Atom Egoyan.
862,1,"The two Oscar-winning costars pull you into this tawdry tale based on taboo fodder, elevating it in the process to something much more profound, and more unflinchingly honest."
863,1,"Tells a darkly funny story about method acting, tabloid obsession, and sexual abuser narcissism with its pitch-black melodramatic camp grounded by a soulful turn from Charles Melton"
864,0,"As May December peters out, it’s inescapable that filmmaker Haynes, ordinarily a competent stylist with a flair for stressed-out heroines, went shopping for the wrong story in the wrong place."
865,1,"It’s a morally ambiguous, gorgeously realized character study. It’s so good to have Todd Haynes back."
866,1,"A deeply engrossing, grotesquely fascinating battle of wills between two formidable women . . . who do not fit reassuringly into neat pigeon-holes. Or genres."
867,1,"Director Todd Haynes comes up with one of his best features in years with this cynical, smart and bloody takedown of true-crime stories."
868,1,"Throughout the film, the director plays the audience like an accordion, pushing buttons and pulling and squeezing us into feeling things — disgust, ironic laughter, confusion, voyeuristic guilt, genuine curiosity — like a master."
869,1,Haynes wants to rehash more than salacious headlines. May December is also a critique of our true crime obsession and the podcast-focused idea that an investigation must have a satisfying conclusion.
870,1,"Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore impress, though Todd Hayne's melodramatic exploration of taboo seems more like snippets of melody than a fully realized ballad."
871,1,"It’s debatable if “May December” reaches a satisfying conclusion, but the journey there is interestingly performed and executed, with Haynes hoping to reach hidden spaces of shame instead of achieving complete closure."
872,1,There’s so much to mine out of this crafty and complex Todd Haynes concoction.
873,1,Enquiring minds want to know: May December is terrific.
874,1,May December feels like Masterpiece Theater Movie of the Week.
875,1,"The result is engaging and resonant—but it nonetheless feels incomplete, unfinished."
876,1,May December identifies the complicated humanity in the notorious... while being a little rueful about the entire idea of digging up the past for content… which very well may extend to the film itself.
877,1,"The stylized campiness of extreme close-ups and surging music drives the twisted nuances of this film. It’s impossible to take your eyes off of it, even if the interactions make you squirm."
878,1,"The actors follow suit, signaling you should be alarmed in performances akin to badly bandaged wounds; you can sense the infection beneath the gauze—that is praise for the acting."
879,1,"“May December,” a skillful and inspired movie, is the product of enormous directorial confidence."
880,1,"May December might be Todd Haynes’ most poignant and emotionally troubling film to date. The director allows his actors to mix comedy and drama in genuine ways, never losing sight of the blurred lines in romantic partnerships."
881,1,"In his most provocative film to date, Haynes’ May December is a chilling yet visually intriguing drama that not only captures the audience’s attention but also showcases Portman and Moore’s electric performances."
882,1,"We watch, increasingly uncomfortable, but can’t look away."
883,1,"The dialogue is faultlessly naturalistic, the acting is uniformly good and, inevitably it seems, in the case of [Julianne] Moore, it’s superb."
884,1,"Thought-provoking, heartbreaking, and at times awkwardly funny. It's a completely melodramatic observation of the family dynamics in a taboo relationship, and yet often campy, too. It's crazy, but it rocks if you vibe with the unique tonal approach."
885,1,"Terrific, riveting but ignores the fact that women can sense a teenage boy’s strong sexual pheromones and their flattering interest is an overwhelming narcotic. And this is why women are still being arrested for sex with teenage boys."
886,1,"May December is lightly told yet packed full of punch; intimately profound, bitterly funny and bitingly sad. An essential watch."
887,1,May December has three powerhouse performances.
888,1,"Todd Haynes takes it to the next level in his talent of complex adult dramas with intimate and profound portrayals, in this Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman vehicle about desire"
889,1,"Once you understand the melodramatic flourishes are intentional, [Todd] Haynes’ soap opera is a treat to behold as it finds its balance between scintillating and solemnity."
890,0,"May December is a captivating fusion of melodrama and camp, reflecting the allure of tabloid sensationalism. The film shines when it focuses on the intricate psychological tango between Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore."
891,1,It's a fiendishly clever film that gleefully deploys a range of metaphors in ways that both lead and wrongfoot the audience.
892,1,"Todd Haynes May December 'pits your emotions against each other, basking in situations that walk a fine line to where morality should land. When you think that you can enjoy yourself, the film acts like a Venus fly trap closing in on you."
893,1,"This unlikely scenario is rendered with wildly shifting tonal complexity, from soap opera to black comedy to intense psychological thriller. And there are searing performances from Moore, Portman, and Riverdale’s Charles Melton as Joe."
894,1,"Julianne Moore is extraordinary as the non-repentant wife, and ""Riverdale"" hunk Charles Melton impresses as her young husband. But it's Portman who delivers a career best turn as a thesp who discovers much more than she expected."
895,1,"In league with their star-studded cast, Burch and Haynes turn a razor-sharp wit and ruthless focus on their audience and our insatiable thirst for true crime carnage, as well as those that feed it."
896,1,"It takes a remarkably self-assured filmmaker to turn such a lurid tale of abuse into something so wildly entrancing and entertaining, but Todd Haynes’ mix of tenderness and camp is a perfect fit for May December."
897,1,"This is an unlikely crackerjack of a film, twisty, sly, provocative, and luxuriantly intelligent."
898,1,"May December recalls soap operas as much as it does cerebral arthouse films like Persona, and proves a watchable romantic drama with plenty of depth."
899,1,"Electrifying. A wickedly funny, taut and provocative psychological thriller."
900,1,"This is an often-hilarious melodrama that never quite goes where you expect it to, knowing when to shock and make the audience laugh in equal measure. It’s safe to say fans of Todd Haynes and his more colourful works will leave very satisfied."
901,1,"Wickedly funny yet truly unsettling, May December walks a tonal tightrope with compelling style."
902,0,"It's ironic that much of The Marsh King's Daughter takes place in a backwoods marsh area, because this entire movie is a soggy mess. It starts off as a monotonous drama and devolves into a series of silly action scenes that don't look believable."
903,1,"Ridley feels challenged in the right ways, while Mendelsohn channels another scummy character to strong effect. The stakes are just high enough to have kept me involved, and that’s fine for a decent paperback come-to-life situation."
904,1,"There’s nothing especially surprising about the way the film wraps up, but it still packs a mild punch, thanks to Ridley’s cold stare, borne of childhood trauma."
905,0,A potent premise and earnest performances from Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendelsohn are let down by an under-written screenplay that submits to the temptations of its genre.
906,1,"The tale is too tame, its savagery held too much in check to truly hold the audience in its thrall."
907,0,"It might make for a better book but The Marsh King’s Daughter is a stiff and stuffy thriller, lacking in a tighter script, and any true energy to dig itself out of the mud."
908,1,"While the premise of The Marsh King's Daughter is rich with the possibility for how introspectively deep the story could go, it doesn't manage to get there."
909,0,"Rather than keeping us guessing or catching us by surprise, the movie goes the more conventional route, leading to an ending that's as far-fetched as it is predictable."
910,0,"After a promising opening, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” quickly falls into a predictable and monotonous slog, plodding along toward an inevitable confrontation between father and daughter."
911,1,"On the positive side, the acting is good and the atmospheric setting is visually pleasing."
912,0,"Carried by a solid cast, The Marsh King’s Daughter tackles its intriguing premise in a competent fashion but never rises above the level of Lifetime thriller."
913,0,"For a thriller to work, you have to guess what's gonna happen, but the minute he [Mendelsohn] escapes from prison you just know exactly what's going to happen. This is a formulaic, predictable thriller."
914,0,It doesn’t take much of a survival instinct to sense that this should be avoided at all costs
915,0,"It's part psychological drama, part thriller, but not an effective whole. ... includes some on-the-nose dialogue for the more-than-capable cast."
916,0,"What starts as an atmospheric, introspective melodrama about fractured family bonds and primal instincts transitions into a formulaic cat-and-mouse saga about paranoia and past secrets."
917,1,"While the opening and closing acts are strong, the middle section sags. Still, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” is a competent, unnerving thriller."
918,0,"When we need the churning dread of an intimate tale of generational trauma, The Marsh King’s Daughter goes formulaic, and when we’re primed for exploitation sweats, it gets flabby."
919,1,"It’s the remarkable cast that saves the day for the film. Daisy Ridley delivers a controlled and haunting performance as Helena, a character deeply scarred by her traumatic past."
920,0,"While the first third establishes the premise with a lot of promise and a compelling backstory, the rest of the film can’t rise above perfunctory cat-and-mouse dynamics that lack urgency and emotional stakes."
921,0,"The film’s pacing sags, undercutting the sense of urgency that makes a thriller."
922,0,"Fans of Ridley will want to check this out for her, because there’s not much suspense to be found elsewhere."
923,0,It's almost inevitable—and just as disappointing—that The Marsh King's Daughter takes the third-act turn that it does.
924,0,Even the more genre-inflected marsh-girl movies have conducted themselves with a little too much decorum—a polite way of saying they take a cheesily therapeutic approach to the lookie-loo pulp they’re peddling.
925,1,"Burger remembers the strength of his opening when father and daughter return to the woods in the last third, and it’s worth the wait."
926,0,"A dull, shallow and underwhelming psychological thriller."
927,0,The Marsh King’s Daughter is a lackluster adaptation of a best-selling novel.
928,0,"The two sides of the endeavor don’t snap together, leaving the viewing experience uneven and the conclusion unsatisfying."
929,1,A powerful story about the psychological hold one person can have on another.
930,1,"With strong performances, the dawdling pace prevents the narrative from fully being realized, but it manages to maintain interest until the very end."
931,1,"Neil Burger’s newest film isn’t revolutionary in its storytelling, nor does it keep us guessing how it’ll end. Still, it features a twisty and unexpected intro and solid performances from talented cast members."
932,0,'The Marsh King's Daughter' is yet another addition to the forgotten library of inconsequential and underdeveloped action thrillers.
933,0,The movie is so afraid of making viewers restless that it shies away from dramatizing anything it can’t resolve in 20 seconds or less.
934,1,B-movie material elevated by A-level performances.
935,0,"Once the film turns into a paranoid home-invasion thriller, there’s no ambiguity left to the tale."
936,1,"The Marsh King’s Daughter doesn’t really have much more on its mind than just serving as an effective thriller, but it achieves its goals thanks to an outstanding cast that makes it all work, and a filmmaker who navigates it all in style."
937,0,"While Ridley gives her all to a more thoughtful and nuanced performance, The Marsh King's Daughter remains a film on a directionless journey to nowhere. Even with the commitment of its lead, it just gets lost in the woods before falling flat on its face."
938,1,"The settings, the striking cinematography, sharp, suspense-heightening editing of the action beats and the stars lead this Marsh King's Daughter out of the swamp."
939,0,"Fans of Ridley will want to check this out for her, because there’s not much suspense to be found elsewhere."
940,0,It's almost inevitable—and just as disappointing—that The Marsh King's Daughter takes the third-act turn that it does.

954,0,"While Ridley gives her all to a more thoughtful and nuanced performance, The Marsh King's Daughter remains a film on a directionless journey to nowhere. Even with the commitment of its lead, it just gets lost in the woods before falling flat on its face."

990,1,"[Please Don't Destroy: The Legend of Foggy Mountain] is awkward, ridiculous fun from some fresh voices, and the best SNL-produced comedy to come along in decades."
991,0,"I mostly found myself giggling through the movie, and I think that’s as much as the creators could hope for from someone who enjoys Please Don’t Destroy in small doses on SNL but isn’t sure their sensibilities translate into a feature film."
992,1,...an entertaining-enough debut for a trio of exceedingly promising comedy stars.
993,0,"If anything, it feels apt to refer to The Treasure of Foggy Mountain as their “not ready for primetime” attempt to deliver a feature capitalizing off their chemistry and sense of humor."
994,1,"With Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, they toe the line between teen boy humor (fart jokes, vulgar sexual references) and genuine messages about friendship and manhood."
995,0,"With their uneven feature vehicle Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, the three decamp to small-town North Carolina as doofuses far outside showbiz, though “Ben,” “Martin,” and “John” remain suspended in a state of arrested adolescence."
996,0,"“The Treasure of Foggy Mountain,” while having its share of laugh-out-loud moments and trademark bizarre humor, is primarily a lifeless mess, just not really connecting in any meaningful way and often just too silly to function in a movie form."
997,1,"Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain has way more laughs than the standard direct-to-streaming comedy, with some gloriously silly running gags and hilarious non sequiturs. But it lacks any real point of view behind that silliness."
998,1,The movie fully embraces how much fun it is to watch people who understand each other on a molecular level.
999,0,"While there are plenty of laughs along the trio’s journey, PDD reminds us why it’s been over a decade since the last SNL feature-length project."
1000,0,"There’s obviously some talent at work here, but not much in the way of stretching, and the initial energy and sheer dorkiness doesn’t generate enough laughs to sustain a movie."
1001,1,"With incredible performances, high-quality jokes, and ambitious production, the movie is a worthwhile adventure that centers on the value of friendship. In the end, you’re bound to be craving more from the comedy trio!"
1002,0,This one is more forgettable than it could have been but also nowhere near the disaster that often comes when members of Lorne Michaels' troupe are allowed out during the day.
1003,1,"The comedy Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain is a hit-or-miss affair, but one that hits slightly more than it misses."
1004,1,"Ultimately, that's what The Treasure of Foggy Mountain is: pure dumb fun, albeit with some awkward dead spots."
1005,0,"Sketch comedy tends to work because you don’t have to spend more than a few minutes at a time with exaggerated caricatures of human beings. This type of humor rarely translates well in a full feature, and this film is proof of that."
1006,1,"A strong feature-length debut for Please Don’t Destroy, mostly proving they can handle the run time and remain fresh with their comedic targets, and their high-energy, good-natured nonsense is great fun to watch."
1007,0,Can an act who does their best work in two-minute bursts hold our attention for an hour and a half? Sort of.
1008,1,I don’t know how long the boys can keep tapping the well of their surreal imaginations before they become exhausting. But I do know that The Treasure of Foggy Mountain made me laugh so hard I missed a number of jokes.

1042,1,"To try to explain and encapsulate the oddity that is Mad Cats seems like a fool’s errand; it’s a puzzling, singular genre blend that’s best experienced rather than rationalized. You’re either in or you’re out. But if you’re in, you’re in for a fine time."

1133,1,"Branagh’s confidence in direction is strong as ever with a narrative half-predicated on thoughtful sound design that equally hinges on his performance, the use of depth in frame draws the eye to clues and behavior while setting the mood"
1134,1,"As a review, this film feels like a detective film from days past, younger audiences might want more, but those who enjoy a slow reveal will have a good time. It gets a B grade from me."
1135,1,It’s not the same kind of reliable guilty pleasure we expect these vehicles to be [...] but this outing of Branagh’s Poirot is at least an interesting experiment in expanding these stories' usual limits.
1136,0,"Stunningly cinematically accomplished that it is, this whirlwind spectacle comes out short in the one thing that matters most in a mystery – the story itself. [...] Feels like a hollowed-out pumpkin, minus the candlelight."
1137,1,"Branagh’s third outing as Poirot is the charm... playing in the what-if gray area opens up options for some great visuals, startling reactions, and cranking up the spooky factor."
1138,1,"In Branagh’s relatively prolific corner of the playground, the real mystery continues to be how Poirot maintains that motherf—er on his face."
1139,1,The secret ingredient has been none other than adapting Agatha Christie through the lens of gothic horror; a subtle twist that instantly turns the fantastic 'Mystery in Venice' into the most stimulating and enjoyable installment of the trilogy.
1140,0,Hercule Poirot is back in this mildly entertaining whodunit with supernatural touches. [Full Review in Spanish]
1141,1,"The film resonates with qualities found in classics of the genre by Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles, and is simultaneously reminiscent in its aggressive theatrical approach to Branagh’s own neo-noir thriller “Dead Again” from 1991."
1142,1,A Haunting in Venice elevates well-worn genre tropes with exceptional casting and filmmaking flair to create a satisfying experience.
1143,1,"A Haunting in Venice isn't quite the best of Kenneth Branagh's Hercule Poirot films, but it's still an inspired effort."
1144,0,"After too many coincidences, Poirot is required to name the killer. Alas, his panache has undergone some wear and tear. Is here anything worse than a gloomy Hercule? He's still a man who needs to think rationally. Solving mysteries is his Belgian waffle."
1145,1,Director and star Kenneth Branagh’s third outing as Agatha Christie’s brilliant and persnickety detective is his most satisfying turn yet. ... briskly entertaining Agatha Christie comfort food with a larger theme about the secrets we carry.
1146,1,"Thankfully, the consistently engaging Haunting feels fresh in a way the nonetheless enjoyable Death didn’t thanks to the addition of a spooky vibe to the series."
1147,0,"The weakest of Branaugh's associations with Agatha Christie, highlighted by the miscasting of Tina Fey."
1148,0,"The mystery itself is rushed and convoluted, rendering this a middling rather than truly timeless Christie adaptation."
1149,1,"A Haunting in Venice is an adequate mystery, with shadows, mystique and a plot with twists and turns."
1150,1,"The film presents a different Poirot than we’ve encountered, just like the story itself is more unfamiliar than the rest. A Haunting in Venice is an example of the treasure trove of stories that Christie has created that we have yet to explore on film."
1151,1,"It's beautifully shot, perfectly set, and filled with great actors - and it's even mercifully under 2 hours. So if you want a good pre-Halloween snack with some chills and thrills but isn't too much, this is a fun one for you."
1152,1,"It’s just some real solid meat and potatoes filmmaking that I’m starting to miss in a lot of stuff I see in the theater. I liked this film a lot, and I do hope they continue to make more of these, but who knows with the way show business is going."
1153,1,"There is a specter of trauma that hangs over the whole movie, turning it from a good classic detective story into something more ghostly and spiritual."
1154,0,"[Kenneth Branagh] seems way more interested in doing gothic horror than mystery. The mystery, in fact, does not make all that much sense."
1155,1,Branagh and Fey make an appealing buddy couple: American sass meets European weltschmerz.
1156,0,Those apparitions haunting A Haunting in Venice are the ghosts of better murder mysteries.
1157,1,"A step up from Death on the Nile, but it would be nice to see Branagh color outside the lines of genre and convention every once in a while."
1158,0,"Branagh tries so hard with those scares — doors banging, chandeliers plummeting, parrots screeching, ghosts looming — that they swiftly become about as chilling as your average caffe latte."
1159,1,"Christie purists may bristle, but the additions work well, especially with Fey’s take on a sort-of sidekick writer full of humorous asides."
1160,1,My guess is that Kenneth Branagh had a lot more fun making A Haunting in Venice than we have watching it.
1161,0,"When all the characters in a murder mystery are annoying, one loses interest in finding out who the killer really is. This movie scared me a little and annoyed me a lot."
1162,1,"It's such a bold stylistic departure from its predecessors, its grandiose production design far more tangible than the garish CGI of Death on the Nile, that it feels somehow bracing and teeming with a nervous energy that's hard to shake."
1163,1,"The style, lucid from beginning to end, supports the ambiguity that inhabits the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
1164,1,"Branagh's take on the material improves with each successive Poirot film. The A-list cast is great, although only Fey and Yeoh get opportunities to shine. It's Branagh's direction that takes center stage, helping to create actual scares and tension."
1165,0,"Though I love the cast and always enjoy the character of Hercule Poirot, A Haunting in Venice felt slow and uninteresting."
1166,1,"A Haunting in Venice is atmospheric enough – and entertaining enough – to make for an appealing Halloween-season diversion, but one walks away from it wishing it provided more."
1167,1,"Kenneth Branagh is not my ideal Hercule Poirot, but this film features an engaging cast and there's something delightful in this casual diversity casting. Also, loved the 1947 era costumes."
1168,1,"Kenneth Branagh’s possibly final entry has an elegance, a grace in how it balances the thematic darkness with the fun of a cracking good murder mystery."
1169,1,The third installment is clearly superior to its predecessor.  [Full review in Spanish]
1170,0,"Branagh himself appears to be having a bit more fun this time, but Tina Fey is trying to outplay him and beyond that destraction there is still a Shakespearean-like hold he still has on this material making any possible sense of fun with it reductive."
1171,1,"A Haunting in Venice is easily the best of Branagh’s Christie adaptations, drawing deeply from the old-world atmosphere of Venice and the allure of a locked room mystery."
1172,0,"A Haunting in Venice is a curiosity, on one hand, there are positives to take away but it also snatches some of them back, giving way to a clunky, disorderly pace that slows the initial promise and makes you feel criminally short-changed."
1173,1,"Branagh’s strong performance is enough to make A Haunting in Venice worth your time, but fortunately this mystery has a little more up its sleeve to make it a worthy addition to a franchise that continues to deliver."
1174,0,"A Haunting in Venice lacks the atmosphere and visual flair to properly spook viewers, or the character development to make the ensemble worth investing in."
1175,1,"An Agatha Christie murder mystery has once again been made a mess by director Kenneth Branagh, this time with A Haunting in Venice."
1176,0,A Haunting in Venice officially derails Kenneth Branagh’s rebooted Agatha Christie films.
1177,0,"The cinematography, the background score and production design prove ample distraction from Poirot’s guesswork-based casework. Given how weak the source material is, and how disinterested Branagh is in the actual death itself, it’s for the best."
1178,1,"More of a psychological thriller-ghost story than a horror tale, “A Haunting in Venice” is a satisfying movie for grown-ups – with a few well-placed jump scares to keep the mystery on track."
1179,1,This is my favorite of the three.
1180,1,It's fun. I think it's it's chilling. I think it's very effective emotionally.
1181,0,A Haunting in Venice eventually progresses into a repetitive and momentum-free midsection...
1182,1,This whodunit will haunt you.
1183,0,That sounds thrilling – the kind of stuff that crackles on screen – but it isn’t. “A Haunting in Venice” flops largely because there’s too much talk and too little action.
1184,1,"Smooth, sinister and studded with stars, A Haunting in Venice is precisely the kind of feet-up matinee entertainment that has rounded off generations of Sunday roasts, just as its David Suchet and Peter Ustinov predecessors did."
1185,1,A Haunting in Venice sits somewhere between the Orient and the Nile and should keep the Christie fans in excellent spirits.
1186,1,Kenneth Branagh finally lives up to his moustaches in the third and best of his Agatha Christie adaptations...
1187,0,"The horror-lite element gives it a boost, with Branagh’s direction conjuring up a few jumps, but this gently entertaining mystery could have used far more scares."
1188,0,"This film infuses the genre tropes of Murder on the Orient Express and its predecessor with the horror genre to mixed results. Each movie has been varying levels of mediocre. However, this one is a disappointment."
1189,1,"While Branagh, Fey and Yeoh are enjoyable to watch, this is the least impressive of Branagh’s Poirot films, especially when it comes to the inevitable denouement."
1190,1,A tribute to the Gothic cinema of yesteryear and also a work with deep themes that feel current. Hercule Poirot keeps him relevant thanks to this stylish and innovative horror film. [Full review in Spanish]
1191,1,A well made throwback to a time when whodunnits could also make the hairs on the back of our necks stand up.
1192,1,... Fun and exciting. Is it as good as the first two? Not quite. [Full review in Spanish]
1193,1,"After the artificial misstep of Death on the Nile, Branagh makes sure the plot is water-tight, and everything is more grounded this time."
1194,1,"A Haunting in Venice is short on any real spooks, but remains a satisfying and stylish murder mystery."
1195,0,"It's such a dull, stiffly rendered mystery that neither the who nor the what of the crime (a mare-dare!, as intoned by Poirot) registers, and even the Venice setting, potentially its chief asset, is wasted..."
1196,1,"A Haunting in Venice knows exactly what it’s doing. More Christie, played by A-listers having fun in a cosy-as-a-cushion, teatime ITV-drama-on-the-big-screen way — catering for a cinema audience left behind by superheroes."
1197,0,"Other than Tina Fey adding a sporadic-dramatic pep to the proceedings, there is absolutely nothing worth your time in this cinematic barbiturate."
1198,0,It's not so much that we figure things out early on; it's that we're not given enough reason to immerse in the gloomy game Poirot must play.
1199,1,"It may be the most simple mystery of the Poirot trilogy, but it is an authentic exercise in classic horror thanks to its camera angles and use of fish-eye lenses... [Full review in Spanish]"
1200,0,All of the ingredients are in place. It’s just that the recipe is completely wrong.
1201,0,"It’s not quite grisly enough to be a crime thriller, or juicy enough as a plot to sustain interest even as a mystery. The scares aren’t that scary, and Poirot’s solutions aren’t impressively revelatory. It’s Poirot by numbers."
1202,0,"With such a great cast, location and setting Branagh’s inscrutable Poirot is not nearly as evocative nor tongue-in-cheek entertaining. By the time the case wraps up, we found it more undaunting than haunting."
1203,1,"A Haunting in Venice is, by some margin, the best adaptation of the now trilogy featuring Hercule Poirot, correcting many past mistakes, and using Kenneth Branagh's innate talent as both filmmaker and actor to stand out as a darker, more atmospheric film."
1204,1,"A Haunting in Venice is being sold as a scary movie yet it’s another good puzzle from Branagh, who goes for a slow burner approach that makes for an elegant mystery. The ghosts dissolve but the fun of the sleuthing remains."
1205,1,A Haunting in Venice is well-made and broadly fits the mandate of what it’s supposed to be. It’s just not as much fun as its predecessors.
1206,1,Branagh gives Poirot vulnerability and depth while handing us a visual feast in his latest Agatha Christie murder mystery
1207,1,A Haunting in Venice is both the best Kenneth Branagh film and the best Agatha Christie adaptation in decades.
1208,1,It's not the most entertaining murder mystery I've seen but it had an interesting premise and engaged me throughout.
1209,0,"This was a pretty significant departure from its source material, which should have made it more intriguing and mysterious...it didn't. This is my favorite of the Branagh's adaptations, but that isn't saying much."
1210,0,The twist(s) were pretty obvious to me from the first act. I wish the pacing was more consistent.
1211,1,"It's a well done, well-crafted story that has a lot of good character development, along with thrills and chills throw in for good measure. If you like the Agatha Christie novels...this one is for you."
1212,1,"Akin to a cinematic escape room, A Haunting in Venice stands as the best of Branagh’s trio of recent murder mysteries."
1213,1,This is the best Christie adaptation from Branagh so far. The Halloween vibes are incredible and Venice is shot beautifully!
1214,1,The best of the three Agatha Christie adaptations. A suspenseful murder mystery with the perfect amount of horror mixed in.
1215,1,"Branagh’s performance and direction provide a level of introspective depth that the standard whodunnit rarely includes or requires, and elevates A Haunting In Venice slightly above the standard detective (and ghost) story."
1216,1,"Well-designed crime construct and atmospheric ambiance with a sprinkle of supernatural, “A Haunting in Venice” is a hauntingly captivating and credible murder mystery."
1217,1,The gothic setting is unique with cinematographer Haris Zambarloukous' lighting evoking classic noir films. The visuals are actually more intruding than the storyline.
1218,1,"Stark and spooky, Branagh's third Poirot movie successfully adopts a whole new atmosphere. It's less exotic and edgier, more haunted; it's a tense, thoughtful, and satisfying mystery."
1219,1,"It’s enjoyable, if familiar."
1220,1,"Like [actor-director Kenneth] Branagh, A Haunting in Venice is both tasteful and tasty. Moody without sacrificing story. Good to the very last whodunnit drop."
1221,1,"But how does A Haunting in Venice compare to Hallowe'en Party, the novel it's supposedly based on. The movie is actually much better than the book."
1222,1,"When embittered Poirot's verbose disillusionment with humanity gets too tedious, Branagh relies on production designer John Paul Kelly & cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos to provide sinister, shadowy distractions wafting in Venice's rain-shrouded canals."
1223,0,"Not the charm you might be hoping for, unless you’re a fan of endless rain, too many jump scares, unsettling camera angles, ragged hand-held camerawork, onerous close-ups, and a score drowning in dreary woodwinds and screechy violins."
1224,0,"Agatha Christie's famed detective has now solved three cases under the Shakespearean actor's direction, but the latest, starring Tina Fey and Michelle Yeoh, still suffers from rigor mortis."
1225,1,"Overcomes complex talkiness to get deeper, which is Branagh's mark on the Poirot character. Tina Fey does her best Dorothy Parker, in a positive way, and mystery buffs (who dig the whodunnit) will also dig this combo of jump-scare & detecting. Mustache!"
1226,1,A Haunting in Venice wears its decadent luxuriousness proudly on its sleeve with the warm lamps throwing sinister shadows that contribute to a glowing gloom as Poirot reveals the dark secrets hidden in normal hearts.
1227,1,"The blend of the supernatural and the cerebral makes A Haunting in Venice the perfect Halloween treat, one where the line between reality and the supernatural is deliciously blurred."
1228,0,"Kenneth Branagh’s latest murder-mystery as Agatha Christie’s Belgian super-detective Hercule Poirot turns out to be a bit of a snoozer...A plodding, muddily plotted affair that looks suspiciously like it was designed for small-screen streaming."
1229,1,"At last Branagh has a sidekick to bounce off in the form of gentle tease Fey, who gleefully delivers put-downs such as describing Poirot as the “number two” greatest detective. They are a fine double act, able to switch tone with ease."
1230,1,A little horror is a welcome addition to these cozy whodunits.
1231,1,A Haunting in Venice is cracking good fun.
1232,1,"A Haunting in Venice turns Poirot into one of the Warrens in The Conjuring saga, allowing him to be poisoned with the senselessness of Gothicism. [Full review in Spanish]"
1233,0,The documentary Bye Bye Barry hardly offers any more insight from the day Sanders left the NFL to the day Prime Video stopped filming and called it a wrap.

1308,0,"At less than 80 minutes, it’s barely even a movie, more one long montage of bits that never run on long enough to be defined as scenes."
1309,0,"Norwood fans hoping for something as hard-hitting as any random episode of “Moesha” will be disappointed, but she does a nice duet of “Let It Snow” with Biggs and sings another pleasant carol over the closing credits."
1310,1,"Its message is an important one and one that will resonate with many, even if the delivery takes a while to fall into place."
1311,1,"This is a film that probably reads better on paper than it plays on screen due to some awkward pacing and clunky editing, but a more serious second half allows for a heartwarming ending."
1312,0,I gave Best. Christmas. Ever! my undivided attention. What I found was an uncanny valley-esque experience that I have to confess I found difficult to translate into the usual form of what we humans know as a ‘film review’.
1313,0,"It's still early in the season, but all viewers should want for Christmas is that Best. Christmas. Ever! won’t be the best holiday title on offer."
1314,1,"Best. Christmas. Ever! is nothing more than a light-hearted comedy, made to be watched with the family and presumably while we put up the Christmas tree. [Full review in Spanish]"
1315,0,"The title of the movie feels ironic here, when it's probably closer to being one of the worst Christmas movies ever."
1316,0,"The best you can say for this — aside from Netflix finding work for older writers and directors — is that it’s shiny, childish background noise that might keep a child distracted long enough for adults to get a turkey in the oven"
1317,1,[Brandy and Heather Graham] explore their character’s strained female friendship with care and nuance. These over-the-top Christmas shenanigans will make you grateful for what you have and for the people around you… with a pinch of Santa’s magic too.
1318,0,It’s a bit presumptuous (and maybe even intentionally ironic) to title a movie Best. Christmas. Ever! (Nov. 16) when the film itself falls below the standard of even the most mediocre of the streamer’s original holiday movies.
1319,0,It’s as artificial as an aluminum Christmas tree. “Best. Christmas. Ever!” isn’t the worst movie ever…but it’s close.
1320,0,"Best. Christmas. Ever! is not the most splendiferous Christmas movie ever, but it will satisfy those hungry for new sentimental holiday movies."
1321,1,"Christmas films should be filled with magic, hope, and all the trimming and traditions to get you in the holiday spirit. Best. Christmas. Ever! does this with its colorful sets, intense decorations, huge snowfalls, and family traditions."

1343,1,"There's something about this story — maybe it's too simplistic, maybe it's the fact that the actual events are so recent that the film can't comment meaningfully on their potential future implications — that makes its populist bent feel contrived."
1344,1,Craig Gillespie’s film guarantees unbridled fun with its uncompromising re-telling of how a cat-tee-clad Redditor/YouTuber and his loyal followers caused a never-seen-before revolution in Wall Street.
1345,1,"Beyond being a work that serves as a testimonial about this enigmatic case, the film is at most fun and not much more. [Full review in Spanish]"
1346,1,"The hedge fund guys are still thriving, still doing exactly what they did before, perhaps with a trifle more caution."
1347,1,Turns what is technically a very boring financial story into a highly entertainment film. Paul Dano and Pete Davison are sensational - the soundtrack could have been a lot better though.
1348,1,"Taken as a whole, “Dumb Money” is a pretty smart dissection of how messed up the financial system is, and why some very rich people prefer it that way."
1349,1,Memes sometimes have a way of making a joke of their reference object but not at the reference’s expense. That's Dumb Money.
1350,1,"Dumb Money is slick, admittedly entertaining stuff but, in reconfiguring whatever fleeting battle was won as a series of fist-pumping financial figures, it merely confirms that the system wins in the long run."
1351,1,You can’t help but feel there was a great movie brewing that got chucked off the boil.
1352,1,"A cautionary tale as much as it is one of conquest, it’s difficult to think Dumb Money won’t serve as something of a blue print for wannabe stock enthusiasts who want to become a little more savvy in their financial moves."
1353,1,"As directed by Craig Gillespie, a lively cast led by Seth Rogen, America Ferrera and Pete Davidson lean hard into the absurdity of this David-vs.-Goliath tale with most amusing results."
1354,1,The writers care about even their smallest characters.
1355,1,"Dumb Money is relatively restrained for such a wild story, but it’s an engrossing one all the same."
1356,1,"Director Craig Gillespie moves things at a cracking pace, punching the point that no rule in the business world, however sacrosanct, is immune from the collective will of people who barely know what they’re doing...Terrific stuff."
1357,1,"Dumb Money is a hugely entertaining yarn, brought to life with real wit and poignancy by director Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) and writers Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo."
1358,0,DUMB MONEY is uninspired with all of its most important beats told to us through mundane montage.
1359,1,Dumb Money is a mostly fun look at a brief moment in which working class underdogs tipped the scales in their favor. For once.
1360,1,Craig Gillespie's The Social Network
1361,0,Isn’t it time that Woodley received a role that is befitting of her strong emotional range and naturalism? She is completely underused here.
1362,0,"Dano and Woodley can’t rescue the film from the valleys into which the story sinks. Happily, the mountains are high when they’re on-screen, but there aren’t enough mountains to climb for others. Too much occurs that comes across as flat and unfocused."
1363,1,"Two-and-a-half years on, GameStop is still struggling, and the system is still rigged. But for an hour or so, the little people can jubilate in their historic moment of collective power."
1364,0,"What are audiences supposed to do with this, anyway? In the midst of the constant buzz surrounding the stock market, Gillespie's film struggles to find its footing."
1365,1,"Keith Gill is a character that could've fallen into caricature, but Dano is capable of grounding him and making him relatable. [Full review in Spanish]"
1366,1,"The acting in this film is strong and effective. The characters are interesting and the story is compelling. It is funny and dramatic, and very entertaining."
1367,1,"It’s fun to watch, though it misses the mark with some of its characters."
1368,1,"That such a specialized story is so pleasant, fun, and even exciting is to the merit of the dialogues by Angelo and Schuker. [Full review in Spanish]"
1369,0,"Rather than a feel-good story, Dumb Money’s overenthusiasm in depicting small victories ignores a harsh reality."
1370,1,"It’s impossible to operate in the real world right now, with union strikes popping off like fireworks in a frying pan, and not get swept up in a movie that thumbs the eyes of the elite."
1371,0,I could barely keep my eyes open during this unfunny snoozer packaged as a wannabe heir to Adam McKay’s 2015 film “The Big Short.”
1372,1,"Dano makes an effective central presence. As he's shown in many previous roles, he can use his unassuming moon face to turn on a dime from a seemingly passive, guileless pawn to a conniving antagonist."
1373,0,"Dumb Money never pays off because of a muddled concept, weak characters and a failed effort to create any real winners in the tale of the little guy versus big financial institutions. Interest starts low and keeps dropping to the point of tedium."
1374,1,"I think Dumb Money is completely worth seeing, but I can’t say you need to go in person to the theater to enjoy it."
1375,1,Craig Gillespie once again draws inspiration from a real case to praise small investors who dare challenge large investment funds. [Full review in Spanish]
1376,1,"Gillespie has a knack for spinning stranger-than-fiction tabloid headlines into compelling entertainment. Dumb Money bursts off the screen with the same anarchic exuberance as Gillespie’s earlier successes, I, Tonya and Pam & Tommy."
1377,1,It is a movie of such fun performances from every single one of the characters. Everybody is just giving it their all.
1378,1,"This movie is brilliantly seamed together with a sprawling cast, but in my mind they weave it well to create a very compelling story. You find yourself rooting for the ""average Joes"" to stick it to the rich folks."
1379,1,A fun and fast-paced comedy about a populist financial uprising.
1380,1,Paul Dano's performance is what makes this movie so great. He blends into the character and seamlessly becomes an analyst who wears cat sweaters and posts memes about the stock he finds interesting.
1381,1,"Documentaries may have beaten it to the punch, but Craig Gillespie's film livens things up with a great cast and some solid laughs while putting more of a hopeful spin that somewhere over the rainbow the rigged system can be taken on."
1382,1,"In the words of GameStop, ‘power to the players’ – Dumb Money is a game worth playing."
1383,1,"There’s a much better version of Dumb Money out there in some alternate universe, but for now, this will do. After all, like Keith Gill said, I like the stock."
1384,0,"...a very, very hit-and-miss comedy that is, to increasingly distressing effect, more the latter than the former..."
1385,1,"Though rough and messy, Dumb Money makes for an entertaining and relatable recount of the GameStop stock story."
1386,1,"This little film has its flaws, but basically, if your bank balance is less than nine figures, there will be something here for you to enjoy."
1387,1,Director Craig Gillespie’s new film Dumb Money transforms the 2021 GameStop short squeeze into a rousing comedy about everyday Americans turning the tables against the financial elite. It’s the best “COVID movie” so far.
1388,1,"Learning the nitty-gritty of this unprecedented stock market event is thrilling, especially since the movie is briskly paced."
1389,1,Director Craig Gillespie treats a serious true story with an appealingly light touch...
1390,1,Paul Dano’s performance elevates this film far above it’s best line or sharpest edit.
1391,1,"It's true, it's funny, and it's smart."
1392,1,"Dumb Money remains watchable, perhaps because it sweeps past us without worrying too much about dotting every ""i'' and crossing every ""t.''"
1393,0,"Strong performances, an interesting topic and a compelling mixture of archival footage and staged content aren’t enough to escape the film’s insistent mediocrity."
1394,1,"Taking clear cues from The Social Network in look, feel, and even score, this is serviceable “punching-up” drama with a good ensemble cast. Don’t expect it to stay that long with you, however."
1395,1,"Despite The Big Short-ish pace and rapid-fire gags, there's a sadness hanging over Dumb Money."
1396,0,"Despite its cynical sentimentality, Dumb Money worships dumb money."
1397,1,"It’s deeply sympathetic towards these people, who are only trying to claw their way out of a trap. It also leaves its own breadcrumb trail of warnings that suggest the community they’ve invested in may not be their salvation."
1398,0,"Takes a story in which a group of people were seen in the popular imagination as scrappy underdogs, and doesn't really do anything to question or interrogate that"
1399,1,"I liked the film/performances, & I used to love the stick-it-to-the-man genre of capitalist criticism. But let's face it, the 1-percenters will always find a way to win the way the system is set up, despite momentary setbacks. Anyway, Pete Davidson rules!"
1400,1,"Like Gillespie's I, Tonya, it's a funny but empathetic portrayal of people who've been reduced to punchlines in news articles."
1401,1,"The film plays with a single card, [Dano's] timid interpretation, that triumphs and goes beyond simple imitation, gifting the protagonist with an air that is both clueless and sagacious. [Full review in Spanish]"
1402,1,"Odds are you’ll...like “Dumb Money.”  It might simply have been a real-life helping of Capracorn, but thanks largely to Dano it’s more substantial than that."
1403,1,"Even with all the finance jargon, Dumb Money has a lightheartedness to it and some humorous lines expertly delivered by the cast."
1404,1,"Focusing mostly on the power of the internet, especially social media, as a means of calling to action among people who would otherwise never connect. [Full review in Spanish]"
1405,1,"A feel-good story about the smarter-than-you-thought pack of misfits who gamed a rigged system, via GameStop, and scored a touchdown for the little guy."
1406,1,"It is never as biting as it should be, although it does give visual and narrative agility to the event... [Full review in Spanish]"
1407,1,"For a Quixotic, quick turn-around comic thriller about stock market winners, losers and supervillains, “Dumb Money” isn’t half bad."
1408,1,"There’s certainly a very cerebral, sharply scripted version of this film somewhere else in the universe. But the Dumb Money we got is serviceably funny and narratively competent if nothing else."
1409,0,Dumb Money is a masterclass in audience emotional manipulation.
1410,1,"Paul Dano is the standout, capturing the courage, doubt, and charisma of someone who accidentally became the voice of the financially depressed in an epic David versus Goliath scenario."
1411,1,Paul Dano never misses in this eccentric film that reminded me of The Wolf of Wall Street meets The Big Short.
1412,1,"A thoroughly entertained viewer will be finger-pointing insanity occurring, in some shape or form, at nearly every turn of this off-the-cuff, firebrand movie."
1413,1,Accomplishes its Money-For-Dummies-Like-Me mission admirably.
1414,1,Dumb Money is worth investing your time in.
1415,1,There’s enough class resentment in this film to warm the heart of Noam Chomsky.
1416,1,"Sounds dry and simplistic, but the script from Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo is vivid and visceral, and somehow brings the stultifying grimness of that central pandemic time block back to painful life."
1417,1,Dumb Money is a giant middle finger comedy to the establishment that’s hilarious and empathetic.
1418,1,"Gillespie manages to make this financial story tense, funny and surprisingly rousing."
1419,0,The Big Short (2015) managed to make the intricacies of the housing crisis both understandable and entertaining. Dumb Money never explains the mechanism behind a short sale or why the short squeeze proved so disastrous for institutional investors.
1420,1,Dumb Money is the first mainstream movie to show how sad and unfair life really was during COVID.
1421,1,"It's rife with F-bombs and other unapologetically raunchy expressions that are likely to shock most people over 40, but if you can endure that, you just might learn something and laugh all the way to the bank."
1422,1,"...We get to partake in a fun re-enactment and see an intriguing overview of the circumstances that took place, (but) the film also becomes somewhat difficult to personally and totally invest in."
1423,1,While the film might have slightly defanged its depiction of the users of the subreddit r/wallstreetbets... it is undeniably perceptive about the insidious influence of social media as a whole.
1424,1,There is a tenseness to this film that keeps you engaged.
1425,1,…. bloody hilarious and well worth your time.
1426,1,"Dumb Money is Gill’s Campbell-esque hero’s journey, and thanks to Dano, it’s one I’m very glad I went on."
1427,1,Dumb Money...certainly works well as a crowd pleasing film.
1428,1,This chronicle of the weird January 2021 boom in GameStop stock is waggish fun.
1429,1,"The mostly young investors in ""Game Stop"" stocks face-off with wealthy hedge fund owners who literally were betting against them, and Gillespie's hip cast makes the whole historic revolution a lot funnier than it really was or, honestly, ever should be."
1430,1,"It’s not a bad way to spend a couple of hours, keeping in mind that this fairy tale, like most, has only a tenuous link to reality."
1431,1,Paul Dano excels in this true tale of how little-guy investors took down billionaire Wall Streeters. Call it a slapstick tragedy with a windfall of laughs
1432,0,"If there were ever a need for a movie to be 75-80 minutes, this is the film I would put up for that... It feels stretched and also not enough due to the script."
1433,1,"This stock market story is a worthwhile buy, and Dano is perfectly cast to bring order to the on-screen chaos."
1434,1,"Paul Dano heads a sprawling cast as the guy leading the rebels with pitchforks on behalf of GameStop, resulting in a film that’s smart and satisfying enough to earn every dollar it makes."
1435,1,"In January 2021, the DIY operation comes to a head when the bigwigs conspire to take back the upper hand. The film does a superb job of showing the difference between the haves and have-nots by contrasting the space, light and décor of their surroundings."
1436,1,"'Dumb Money' is pretty good, even if the culture of instant nostalgia that forced it to rush into production to beat out nine competing projects is pretty terrible."
1437,1,Explores the universal themes of dreams and ambition while also reminding us that there’s a lot of power in the bottom 99%
1438,0,There are  a dozen or so characters that all get arcs and all have stories but none of them are explored enough
1439,0,"Dumb Money doesn’t have the same market value as The Social Network, which has a major hold over its entire stock. Pro tip, you should be selling instead of buying into this mid-movie."
1440,1,"But what it does do well is champion the little guy and, from the music to the memes to the masking, “Dumb Money” amplifies all those little details that made being alive in 2020 and 2021 so cuckoo, bonkers crazy."
1441,1,"The stranger-than-fiction real life story is skillfully brought to the big screen by a team so talented, it's an embarrassment of riches. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1442,1,"Comparisons The Big Short are inevitable, because it is kind of covering similar, complicated territory... but [director Craig Gillespie] makes it accessible."
1443,1,"Where the reactionary slashers of the ’70s and ’80s exploited their young audience’s appetite for sex and effectively punished them for it, Talk to Me is a thoughtful attempt to figure out what really frightens teenagers today."
1444,1,"Everything an audience might want from a horror movie is here: original ideas, quality acting, jump scares, rising dread, and a powerful sense of allegory."
1445,1,"Talk to Me is uncompromising and emotionally brutal, it’s gross and smart, and I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind since I saw it."
1446,1,"Disembodied hands have long been a mainstay in horror cinema, and it’s to the credit of the Philippou brothers that they’ve come up with a unique approach to the errant appendage."
1447,1,...it is easy to label [Talk To Me] as one of 2023's best horror films.
1448,1,The majority of the feature demonstrates the capacity of the Phillipou's to be at the service of their characters and for their fabrication of a tense environment that is more and more desperate.  [Full review in Spanish]
1449,0,"It works like gangbusters until it really doesn't. Still, there is something to be said for a near miss that leaves you somewhat intrigued for what the filmmakers will do next."
1450,1,"It has a good rhythm and curated visual work - characters that appear slightly blurred, dark lighting, overwhelming close-ups - that contributes to creating a disturbing atmosphere throughout the film. [Full review in Spanish]"
1451,1,"Talk to Me is TWISTED, TERRIFYING, and the BEST HORROR film of the year. Directors Danny and Michael Philippou deliver inventive and genuine scares that will linger long after watching."
1452,1,"Despite its flaws and the relatively simple concept, Talk To Me proves to be a successful spookster for the majority of its runtime."
1453,1,"The debut from YouTubers-turned-filmmakers the Philippou brothers makes for sharp, bloody viewing, even if it runs out of steam"
1454,1,"Although Talk to Me isn’t particularly innovative, it does show considerable skill from the Philippous, who show some inspired visual acumen and keenly balance the gross/scary/funny equation, two things that better horror films do."
1455,1,"Talk to Me is a sleek, frightening, and unique construction that digs into teen loneliness and dispossession through actual possession. It is literally bone crunching and ferocious with gore aplenty but is also empathetic."
1456,1,"It's committed to the darkness of its premise, and I like that."
1457,1,"Despite its minor issues, Talk to Me is still a hell of a debut feature and an excellent Australian horror picture. Wilde is absolutely terrific in it as Mia and the Philippous inject new ideas into ancient formulas."
1458,1,"TALK TO ME is extremely effective as a horror film, but I don't know if its ambiguity (in the end) completely works as its final moments are arguably misguided."
1459,0,"A supernatural horror film that shakes hands with topics about the grief of loss and adolescent fragilities, but whose core remains trapped in a chapter of possessions and jump scares that lack any kind of chills. [Full review in Spanish]"
1460,0,"The concept is cool. The performances are solid, with a haunting atmosphere that keeps the tension going during crucial moments... but I couldn't connect at all. [Full review in Spanish]"
1461,1,A refreshing Horror film that builds on its story & characters over just visuals that will shock you. Fantastic film.
1462,1,"The shock value of the violence and terrifying imagery is enough to stay with you long after you leave the theater so be warned. However, cinephiles will know that since it's an A24 film, it's going to stand out in more than a cheap jump scare way."
1463,1,"A frightening and innovative tale of grief, loneliness, and the dire consequences of messing with the dark arts."
1464,1,"The Philippou twins, aka YouTubers RackaRacka, make a chilling feature debut as they chart Mia’s journey from cherished friend to exiled girl alone and in grief and guilt."
1465,1,"The Philippous refreshingly mine their own viral video experiences, as well as the potent concept of trauma allowing otherworldly forces to take body control. The confident style and sharp imagery make this worthwhile viewing for horror aficionados."
1466,1,"""Talk to Me"" is a compelling watch, showcasing skilled direction, emotional depth, excellent sound design, and a standout background score. Although it excels in many aspects, it falls short of perfection and the hype surrounding it."
1467,1,"Gripping from the beginning and unrelenting in its terror, Talk to Me will surely be the source of nightmares for many."
1468,1,"Talk to me is pure horror. A creative, rebellious and fast-paced study of anxiety in the age of immediacy. [Full review in Spanish]"
1469,1,"Despite its flaws, we can say the Philippou brothers have debuted with the right foot forward. Or rather show that they have a good hand? [Full review in Spanish]"
1470,1,"It’s cool, unsettling, and a return to a recipe that I often worry has been forgotten. Talk to Me is the kind of movie that reminds me of why I fell in love with the genre."
1471,1,"With a fresh take on the genre formula, the Philippou siblings deliver a truly scary and unsettling modern horror story. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1472,1,Incredibly effective.
1473,1,"It's beautifully cast, and I think we get to make judgments about the characters -- and we actually sympathize with them -- without them being mawkish or unbelievable."
1474,1,"Talk to Me feels fresh, due to the emotionally grounded performances of its young cast, and how the Philippous continuously raise the stakes on the consequences of their characters’ horrendous choices."
1475,1,"Danny and Michael Philippou achieve a horror film that, even though it stays on well-trodden paths, knows to reach its own destiny where boredom and cell phones reveal its most tragic and fatal side. [Full review in Spanish]"
1476,1,"Talk To Me is a brutal, relentless movie unafraid to go places mainstream Horror rarely visits in contemporary Cinema. Its unique and efficient set up place it one step above from siimilar productions."
1477,1,Talk to Me has the effervescence of a debut film and the technical solidity of a career that's been simmering for years. [Full review in Spanish]
1478,1,"Filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou emerge as the promising new voice of horror. It’s frightening, well-crafted, and on par with genre greats Wes Craven and Sam Raimi."
1479,1,"A decent effort, but doesn't hit like the best horror does."
1480,1,"Imagine an early M. Night Shyamalan movie, such as The Sixth Sense, stripped of all the director's fuzzy optimism and belief in serendipity, and you're starting to grasp the mood of Talk to Me."
1481,1,The twin brothers of Danny and Michael Philippou have found the right formula for a modern horror tale.
1482,1,"A young, talented cast and a captivating production make a horror film that aficionados of the genre should not miss. [Full review in Spanish]"
1483,1,A brilliant deconstruction of the habitual history of the ouija. [Full review in Spanish]
1484,1,"Although the film's plot is not without holes, Mía's drama is so convincing that they get relegated to the background. [Full review in Spanish]"
1485,1,"With a solid year for horror, Talk To Me stands out as something fresh and chilling. Honestly, this is the type of film to haunt you after."
1486,1,"In addition to well-crafted horror scenes, the film is supported by a disturbing color palette and a mix of confounding sounds and real noises, and it touches upon fears that are very natural. [Full review in Spanish]"
1487,1,Director and co-writer Danny Philippou and director Michael Philippou bring us an eerie story with unexpected violence that is the source of the horror. The level of violence will make you look away or gasp like the crowd in my screening.
1488,1,"TALK TO ME is a terror filled movie that burrows its way into your worst nightmares. A gritty, seemingly simple horror film that uses a fantastical object to make a sinister and brutally truthful commentary about the dangerous power of unresolved grief."
1489,1,Talk to Me works so well because it knows when and how to build a scene with latent tension. Each séance possesses superlative intensity. [Full review in Spanish]
1490,1,"... A bloody story that while it also rewards with themes about addiction, mourning, and the darkness of loneliness, it never loses its intent: to put forth a horror movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
1491,1,"A legitimately thrilling first act sets the stage for a movie we will never get, making for a resolution that nails all the technical aspects, albeit with a frustratingly predictable narrative."
1492,1,"The direction, acting, editing and especially sound design are all flawless. Alas the narrative - which feels fresh in the front half - becomes too pedestrian and familiar in the back half with its focus on Mia's grief."
1493,1,"This is a superbly made debut that marks out both Philippous as serious horror talents to watch. Their next film can’t come soon enough, even if it ends up being Talk To Me Too."
1494,1,"Though not the masterpiece it's being lauded as, Talk to Me is a good (and at times very good) entry into this well-trodden and popular horror genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
1495,1,"Talk to Me holds you in its grip until it’s over, but that’s it. On the strength of pure craft and ambition, the Philippous have earned entry into the elevated-horror club; maybe as they grow and develop as directors, they’ll renounce their membership..."
1496,1,"One of the scariest horror films in recent years! Impressive practical effects, superb makeup, hypnotizing performances – Sophie Wilde clearly stands out the most – and impeccable execution of truly shocking, gory, unpredictable moments of violence."
1497,1,A supremely terrifying film mixing the horrors of the restless undead with the greater horror of emotionally absent parents.
1498,1,The themes of grief and loss in Talk to Me are felt very much throughout the story. The film has a very creepy ending that isn't typical of most horror movies.
1499,0,I expected it to be much more of a thriller. It was just average all way round.
1500,1,"From its gut punch of an opening to its poetically ironic ending, directors Danny and Michael Philippou wring viewers dry with their masterful horror film “Talk to Me.”"
1501,1,Grittier and more naturalistic then many would have expected it to be.
1502,1,"Talk to Me is a gripping dialogue on the dread and vulnerability of love, loss and longing."
1503,1,"“If there are ghosts, we probably shouldn’t TikTok them possessing us” is a simplistic but alarmingly sufficient argument. No notes."
1504,1,What separates Talk to Me from some other entries in this genre is just how unrelentingly cruel it is.
1505,1,"Talk to Me's unsettling atmosphere and uncanny visuals will leave you on edge throughout, and its clever, sparing use of effects adds to the authenticity of the supernatural stuff. This film will not just scare you, it will chill you to the bone."
1506,1,"While some horror fans may argue the movie doesn’t quite nail the ending, all will readily admit this production does much more right than it does wrong."
1507,1,"What drives the film and its scares are the excellent lead performances. Aside from the directors, this movie is also a great introduction of an actor like Sophie Wilde, who brings a wide-eyed, human intensity to the role."
1508,1,"Everybody does a great job, but Sophie Wilde is the star of this film... I thought she was phenomenal: human, vulnerable, and scary all at the same time."
1509,1,"Horror movies can be really good with a minimal budget... You don't need big-name actors, [you just need] a good premise. And this movie has a great premise."
1510,1,Talk to Me brings a fresh and unique spin to the otherwise cliche-ridden subgenre of haunting/possession movies. The first-time directors achieve an uneasy sense of dread that makes for one of the most effective horror movies of the year.
1511,1,"There are moments when the movie makes the theater feel like a vacuum, sucking you into a vortex of heart-racing, chest-clutching, jaw-dropping terror. It’s the enthralling kind of horror that you can’t look away from."
1512,1,The silly humour and the earnest writing make this inherently watchable. It’s clear there’s an intense love of the genre through every frame of this film.
1513,1,"The naturalistic dialogue, realistic relationships, and character-driven plot points -- enhanced by the performances of a tight and talented cast -- make the supernatural scares and brutal violence hit the viscera even harder."
1514,1,"The ensemble never steps out of character, no matter how improbable the situation. While Wilde and Otto are the standouts, best supporting actor must go to the embalmed hand."
1515,1,... tailor-made to become a cult classic... a script that gets under your skin as much as in your face... delivering horrors promised while fulfilling the needs of the story... possibilities will live rent-free in viewer's heads after the credits roll.
1516,0,"...a complete misfire that does, in the end, take itself way, way too seriously."
1517,1,"One sad, scary allegory on why kids shouldn't do drugs — especially if they're going through personal pain."
1518,1,"Talk to Me is a lot of unsettling fun. The Philippous show tremendous promise, and Wilde has the entrancing screen presence to become a major star sooner rather than later."
1519,1,"Flies by with thrilling energy, plenty of nightmare fuel, and inventive ways that make the very tired possession subgenre come alive again"
1520,1,A potent mix of psychological and visual horror.
1521,1,"Though the resulting film owes much to the like of Flatliners and the Evil Dead, it’s a solid launch pad for the Phillippou brothers."
1522,1,"Beyond being a great horror movie Talk to Me is one of the best films of the year. Sophie Wilde gives a star turning, tour de force performance you can't take your eyes off of."
1523,1,The movie steadily generates a palpable sense of unease that culminates in a handful of genuinely chilling scenes and one cracking ending that makes the film’s frustrations a little easier to digest.
1524,1,"It might’ve been slightly oversold to horrorheads as a new height of never-before-seen terror, but at its best, Talk To Me still packs a grisly, dread-inducing impact."
1525,1,"This is horror of the highest order, the kind that leaves you feeling both giddy and unsettled — almost as though you’ve allowed some strange force in and aren’t sure whether you want it to leave."
1526,1,"It’s like painfully spicy food; it hurts in places you didn’t know you could feel, but the reward is worth the pain."
1527,1,Talk To Me is a good movie that both serves its horrorcore and has intelligent observations about high school behavior.
1528,1,"The film's emotional depth may surprise fans of the Philippous' raucous, ultraviolent YouTube channel RackaRacka. Make no mistake, though, the brothers demonstrate cracking filmmaking skills."
1529,1,"There are just enough emotional undercurrents to make it feel like there's depth to the characters, but even this is adeptly deployed to freak us out in properly disturbing ways."
1530,1,"Even if Talk to Me falls away towards the end, ditching satire and sass for ghosts and ghouls, every new generation needs a horror to call its own, and this, like The Blair Witch Project in the Nineties, may just be that."
1531,1,"Though it leans on familiar genre tropes and stylistic conventions, a devastating script and charismatic cast (spearheaded by Sophie Wilde) make Talk To Me a terrifying and pervasively heartbreaking tale of grief."
1532,1,"Signals a strong new voice in the genre with the Philippous that is equally confident, commanding, and committed to slinking under your skin."
1533,1,"Talk to Me is meticulously crafted to scare the shit out of you, haunting you long after the credits have rolled."
1534,1,Potent and evocative meditation on grief and addiction.
1535,1,"A completely original, frightening, terrifying and shocking horror film led by a captivating performance from Sophie Wilde. More horror films like this please!"
1536,1,A scrappy little effective horror movie
1537,0,"The Philippous blessedly resist relying on jump scares and put their trust in the power of disturbing imagery. Even still, these jolts prove far too few."
1538,1,An auspicious debut. There’s a bracing meanness to the movie that keeps you guessing where it’s gonna go.
1539,1,Talk to Me defines what makes indie horror so dang fun
1540,1,"I'm not particularly a big fan of scary movies, but this movie was terrifying - in a good way. This is one of the better scary movies I've seen in quite a long time."
1541,1,"Actors as incisive and persuasive as Wilde, Jensen and Bird break your heart a little, while the trials they endure are making that same heart race."
1542,1,...skips the random set-piece killings you might expect and tightly focuses on familial horror and doom-laden dream logic...
1543,1,"The result is an eerie, gross, and darkly amusing film."
1544,0,"This VOD horror-adjacent character study looks at newlyweds on their honeymoon in Miami, where drugs, lust and resentment combine for grisly results."
1545,1,"In John Ainslie’s trippy hotel psychothriller, a drug-taking couple checks in, drops out, eats in and works through what they really want"
1546,1,"An example of a bad romance in every sense, Do Not Disturb is enthralling horror that thrills, entices, and titillates, becoming something rather unique and unexpected."
1547,1,"‘Do Not Disturb’ starts a slow-burn romantic drama and erupts into an arterial spray full of psychedelic, cannibalistic sex."
1548,1,"A mature take on marital horror. The leads look great covered in blood, but the issues they face are scarier."
1549,1,"The result is an eerie, gross, and darkly amusing film."
1550,0,"This VOD horror-adjacent character study looks at newlyweds on their honeymoon in Miami, where drugs, lust and resentment combine for grisly results."

1572,1,"A mature take on marital horror. The leads look great covered in blood, but the issues they face are scarier."
1573,0,The Hunger Games is insipid. [Full review in Spanish]
1574,1,"I confess that for all my issues with the film (and there are many), I more impressed at how much it got right."
1575,1,"The first film in this franchise is really fun. Yes, it is long, but with the smaller budget the filmmaking is really strong and the emotional beats do work."
1576,1,"Whatever objections one might have about the execution, it’s a compelling story that’s been made into a serviceable film."
1577,1,It’s a dystopian science fiction film that’s based on a preposterous premise yet it manages to be strikingly entertaining.
1578,1,The Hunger Games is every bit as thrilling as its source material even if it does make some changes from the book.
1579,1,[Rue's] presence gave the heart to the whole movie.
1580,0,"The world and the situation in which Katniss finds herself are ripe with possibilities for deeper commentary, but so many of those possibilities are dissipated as the reader or viewer becomes swept up in the steady piling up of corpses."
1581,1,"Despite its intriguing, albeit recycled plotline, several plaguing elements eat away at the intensity and - perhaps more importantly - the believability."
1582,1,"The Hunger Games isn't a masterpiece, but it is far better than what most likely expected from the film."
1583,1,"'The Hunger Games' is a fantasy spectacle that energetically takes over your eyes and leaves you hungry for more ""games"" and its strange dystopian future.. [Full review in Spanish]"
1584,0,It doesn't leave any room for virtuosity and is about as literal and unsurprising a visual realisation of the story as you can get.
1585,1,"Although the casting of a relative unknown like Jennifer Lawrence in the crucial role of Katniss was a bit controversial, in the hindsight of her Oscar win and status as hottest young thing in Hollywood, the choice seems brilliant."
1586,1,"THE HUNGER GAMES has made its mark and, despite its issues, is a more interesting and admirable one than the 12A audience has been offered in some time."
1587,1,"It's a bit of a thrill to see a bow-hunting girl nursing and defending her man, a good enough takeaway on its own to recommend The Hunger Games to both kids and the parents who drive them to the movies."
1588,1,"Jennifer Lawrence is engaging as Katniss; indifferent to the circumstances and determined to survive, you end up admiring her spunk and defiance to The Man."
1589,1,"Are you hungry yet? I hope so because with The Hunger Games you are in for a seven course meal with all the trimmings, guaranteed to satisfy even the most ravenous fan."
1590,1,"At its best The Hunger Games is a taut thriller, an edge-of-your-seat ride once the actual games begin."
1591,1,"Jennifer Lawrence is superb, with an unflinching gaze that's like a powerful alloy of fear and defiance."
1592,1,"A beautiful, deeply affecting, and riveting film with a heroine for the ages."
1593,1,The odds are in its favor to please its hard-core devotees and newcomers alike.
1594,1,"The Hunger Games is undeniably progressive in making its protagonist so plucky, independent, and self-actualizing a young woman."
1595,1,"The Hunger Games is good, moves adroitly and holds our attention. It just doesn't fire the imagination the way its source material seems to have done for many readers."
1596,1,Lawrence is superb in her role.
1597,1,What the film offers that the book does not are elements of the outside world that readers were not privy to when confined to Katniss' head.
1598,1,The Hunger Games isn't a masterpiece. But it's finally given us a thoughtful action picture for the young and old alike.
1599,1,"The Hunger Games is impressively cast, beautifully styled, dynamically shot and powerfully edited. However, the standout feature of the film has to be its all encompassing success as an adaptation."
1600,1,"Ross' film has a defined universe of its own, populated with genuinely emotive, living characters and a tangible sense of despair and decay."
1601,1,"It takes a while to get off the ground as they are setting up the story for the entire trilogy, but other than that, this movie is a well-acted, visually stunning film."
1602,0,"Just to show you how dim Gary Ross is, he seems to think he had an ""idea"" about how to portray the poor oppressed people of District 12. He has them all dressed up like 1930s characters. Yup. That's his idea."
1603,1,"It's as thrilling, captivating and immediate as the book, while streamlining the narrative and cast to fit the conventions of cinema."
1604,0,"An edible product, but it leaves the spectator in need of a more satisfying meal."
1605,1,"Extravagant special effects are passed over to give the captivating characters the audience's full attention. Even the picture is often drained of colour, ensuring focus is placed on the people rather than the spectacle."
1606,1,"This is explicitly not a film about young love, or being torn between boyfriends...It's about being brave, and being alone, and having to grow up too soon."
1607,1,It's too derivative to feel really special... but it approached some of the material boldly enough to at least feel like an interesting view of familiar ground.
1608,0,"We've been telling this story for a while now in different forms and modes. . .But The Hunger Games, the books and now the film, have inspired a frenzy in the pre-teen set. I'm not exactly sure why."
1609,1,"It adds up to an intelligent, reasonably well-made first installment that leaves us primed for Katniss' future adventures."
1610,1,"A refreshingly gritty and adventurous affair that packs plenty of thematic depth, it doesn't let the ambitious source material down."
1611,0,"Has all the technical ingredients of a great (and even important) film, but sideswipes them in order to leave the audience feeling like that they have been abandoned in the wilderness of extreme cruelty."
1612,1,"Though not at all innovative or original, is at least a worthwhile action fantasy."
1613,1,Director Gary Ross does a great job in bringing the thrilling novel to life in this uncompromising drama.
1614,0,"The movie is oddly blithe about its central premise. How can this movie set up this monstrous society and this brutal game of genocide and expect us to not only cheer for someone to ""win,"" but also hope she finds someone to kiss in the end?"
1615,0,The film shows precious little hunger and no sense of game.
1616,1,"Lawrence makes Katniss a heroine every bit as strong, fearless and compelling as the patron saint of badass females, Lisbeth Salander."
1617,1,"The filmmakers' devotion to Collins' page-turner will please the book's fans and anyone who likes action, sci-fi, social commentary or a female protagonist with smarts, compassion and survival skills."
1618,1,An exhilarating debut from the bestselling series about teenagers engaged in a deadly bloodsport.
1619,1,"Given the recent failure of so many big-budget films, the odds weren't in The Hunger Games favor, either. Thankfully, Hollywood got this one right."
1620,1,"The supporting cast is excellent (most notably Stanley Tucci as flamboyant television host Caesar Flickerman, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy, Katniss and Peeta's troubled mentor)."
1621,1,Some plot threads are underserved but The Hunger Games is a fascinating and disturbing character drama that successfully captures the core themes of the book.
1622,1,"Sure this entry is a ripoff of ""Battle Royale,"" but it's still an entertaining ride with great casting that will more than likely please fans of the book and those who've never even heard of it."
1623,1,"Despite a few minor problems, The Hunger Games proves to be a promising start to what will no doubt become the next beloved Hollywood mega-series."
1624,1,"While the 12A rating renders any serious violence a tad impotent, there is much more going on here than the fawning and frowning of its soppy vampire peer."
1625,0,A retread of a tale that's The Running Man meets Lord of the Flies with a dash of Twilight for tween-adoring measure.
1626,1,"I never thought I'd describe a film by Pleasantville and Seabiscuit director Gary Ross as 'whackadoodle,' but if the shoe fits."
1627,1,"The Hunger Games may be a flawed beast, to be sure, but there's plenty of subtext to glean from the narrative, and a slew of wonderfully rich characters worth investing in."
1628,1,"While a great ride of a movie, it is also one wrapped around an oddly disquieting message."
1629,1,The first genuine can't miss film of the year that you'll want to go back to the theater to see over and over again.
1630,0,"Katniss embodies all that's better than her Hunger Games opponents, being aptly appalled at what she sees while also learning to manipulate her audience."
1631,1,"""The Hunger Games"" stomps the ""Twilight"" saga flat, and though I found those films somewhat amusing, this one is the real deal..."
1632,1,... Does a more-than-adequate job of introducing a future world and characters I won't mind revisiting. And it gives you a little to think about while you're waiting.
1633,1,"A blockbuster that has something to say about the world we could be living in. Unlike Twilight, this film actually has a deeper and more important philosophical meaning."
1634,1,The phenomenal cast with great chemistry and sincere authentic performances from the older actors empowers the material.
1635,1,Here's the movie for which millions of fans have been starving.
1636,1,If 'The Hunger Games' represents the latest book-turned-film blockbuster franchise built on the backs of fanatical adolescents then this is progress indeed.
1637,1,"[Ross'] version of The Hunger Games, while not perfect, is probably as magnificent I ever my wildest dreams could have hoped for it to be."
1638,0,"For those unacquainted with the novel, it's a narratively unsatisfying - not to mention visually static - affair, regardless of how much Jennifer Lawrence holds her own."
1639,0,"What works on the page may not translate to the screen. That's always been the challenge of bringing a writer's vision to the movies. It all comes back to ""suspension of disbelief."""
1640,1,"Whatever rough patches and shortcomings this first film has, that by the end I was indeed interested in seeing what happens next speaks to how Ross got it mostly right."
1641,0,"If you've never read Collins' novels, the odds that you'll enjoy the film are not in your favor."
1642,1,This movie rules.
1643,1,"If the setup behind 'The Hunger Games' upsets you, that's a good thing."
1644,1,"Lawrence is a strong role model for young girls with her character's sacrifice, courage, moral grounding in a world that's lost its own, and will to fight for what's right, even if it means sacrificing her own life or sparking a revolution."
1645,1,"I didn't read the book. While the film is entertaining enough, I never felt drawn in to this new world."
1646,1,"An entertaining adventure, but while director Gary Ross gets terrific performances from Tucci, Banks, Harrelson, and Lawrence, he drags it out far longer than the story requires."
1647,1,"Lawrence is terrific in the lead role and gives us someone to root for to survive this horrible ordeal. The supporting players carve out memorable characters. The musical score, costumes and makeup are the other strengths."
1648,1,I found the sardonic satire of the movie's first half in the Capitol (a city that suggests a meeting of L. Frank Baum and Albert Speer) more intriguing than the insufficiently suspenseful depiction of the Hunger Games competition itself...
1649,1,"Lawrence proved her ability to carry a character's heavy burden in Winter's Bone. As Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who is both physically and morally strong, she has gravitas, rarely breaking into a smile, but reveals no sign of self-seriousness."
1650,1,"Smarter and tougher than Twilight - and with a heroine who couldn't be further removed from drooping, love-struck Bella Swann."
1651,1,"Solid enough, but for a non-fan fairly unremarkable."
1652,0,"A cheap looking, drab film."
1653,1,A triumph of restraint - but had the film been more visceral and less sanitised it might have better implicated viewers in the voyeuristic bloodlust of its entertainment.
1654,1,"It is better than any of the Twilight movies, which isn't saying much, but it isn't bad. It is just barely O.K. and it badly needed more Steadicams."
1655,0,The battle that informs this adaptation is between the filmmakers' intent to create a moneymaking franchise... and the efforts of star Jennifer Lawrence to create a compelling movie.
1656,1,"It has the slightly grubby, cobbled-together look of a futuristic flick from the '70s, but that is part of its charm."
1657,1,"Jennifer Lawrence brings to the pulpy material a sense of weight and gravity that few young actresses could muster; she has a flinty strength that enhances, rather than belies, her soft features, and it makes Katniss a completely believable protagonist."
1658,1,"The movie on its own terms is an entirely likable thriller, if a bit light on intelligence and personality."
1659,1,Jennifer Lawrence's shining talent makes it all come together.
1660,1,The film is aided immeasurably by Judianna Makovsky's costume design. Clothes are an intentional method of deciphering The Hunger Games' politics.
1661,1,"This tension-filled action-adventure delivers a pulse-pounding, pop culture message of female empowerment."
1662,1,The Hunger Games is much more than a game. It is a memorable human experience. Thank the gods for the wonder of literature and the vision of movies. Some of us still hunger for eloquence on the screen.
1663,1,"Comparisons have been made to Battle Royale - and they're not entirely undeserved - but this is a different film, and never feels like a watered down version of anything else."
1664,0,"Even when two people are just talking calmly, Ross jerks the camera around. Why? As the sense of danger increases, he has nothing to build toward."
1665,1,As if it were a survival reality TV show with a real pulse.
1666,1,"Finally we have a female lead character who is strong without being brutal, appealing without being objectified, and confident without being female-chauvinistic."
1667,1,"While the ending is a bit of a mess, the rest isn't terrible (and nobody sparkles in the sunlight)."
1668,1,"Gary Ross' first foray into action filmmaking is occasionally hampered by wobbly camera-work, but is successful in the way it communicates the horror of violence without threatening the teen-friendly rating."
1669,0,"For those who have not read the book, this film is a movie without a cause."
1670,1,"Lawrence lends Katniss the kind of gravitas that, initially at least, makes the film's bleak vision of the future seem credible."
1671,1,Does it really matter that this is not an entirely new idea? Nope.
1672,0,It's far too long and much inferior to the ferocious Japanese Battle Royale.
1673,1,A sassy comedy that raises questions for people of all ages about what it means to frame your life as a quest.
1674,1,"Barbie is feminism 101, but for the global mainstream audience who have been served nothing but depoliticised superheroes for decades, the directness of Barbie's feminism is an essential step for reclaiming the soul of the Hollywood blockbuster."
1675,1,"[Barbie] takes our complicated real-world relationship to Barbie and uses it as a metaphor to interrogate the impossibly high, often contradictory standards women are held to in our male-dominated culture."
1676,1,To watch Barbie is to feel totally and completely seen. And that's what makes Barbie worthy of the wait.
1677,1,"The laughs are plentiful and the set design is eye-popping, but what makes Barbie truly work is its deft tackling of numerous themes."
1678,0,"Barbie boasts impressive production design, costumes, and a pair of leads up to the task of bringing their respective dolls to life, but sadly comes up a little short when it comes to its screenplay."
1679,1,"The film’s boldness and, frankly, weirdness, allows Barbie to become a successful sum of its parts. It’s a film that clearly has something to say and doesn’t want audiences to get caught up in the fact that it’s a doll at the center of it."
1680,1,"One of the best films of the year in cinematographic terms, probably the best comedy that we have seen in a long time, and an extraordinarily entertaining product that promotes the value of searching for a more cohesive society. [Full review in Spanish]"
1681,1,"Gerwig and Baumbach lure viewers with the promise of squeaky clean pop-culture fun, all while Trojan-horsing a stranger, more complex battle of the sexes."
1682,1,Barbie is a dazzling new instant classic and unlike anything you’ve seen before. It’s the perfect summer movie and one of the funniest of the year.
1683,1,"Though presented as a funny comedy about the doll that we all know, in reality, it is a very fine and brave portrait of what it means to be a man and a woman today. [Full review in Spanish]"
1684,1,"Early-on, ""Barbie” resembles those Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello beach party movies. It's breezily photographed in pop art colors by Rodrigo Prieto. In Barbieland, the houses don’t have walls and everybody seems happy. Mellow whimsy prevails."
1685,0,"It explores the frailties of masculinity and the post-feminist struggle to escape the matrix of utopian feminism, even though Barbie and Ken's journey of self-discovery sometimes misses the point of fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
1686,1,It's the rare film that's as intelligent as it is entertaining.
1687,1,"...[Greta] Gerwig’s pink, plastic epic is infused with its director’s indie spirit and far more cognizant of the toy’s complicated legacy than you might expect."
1688,1,"The film gets a little lost at times, as if it had too many storylines to play with and won’t let any of them go... But there are many great jokes in the film."
1689,1,Greta Gerwig has created a coming-of-age feminist self-aware masterpiece in Barbie with a heart of gold that both subverts and matches expectations.
1690,1,"Barbie isn’t as streamlined as my favorite girl comedies, but it’s more thematically ambitious than many of them too. And I’ll take flawed ambition over plastic perfection any day of the week."
1691,1,"All is peaceful and idyllic, that is until Stereotypical Barbie inexplicably blurts out a passing thought about death."
1692,1,"Greta Gerwig's summer blockbuster is well worth watching, but fails to reach the storytelling heights of her previous work."
1693,1,"This funny, eye-catching film sports pitch-perfect performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, paying tribute to the iconic toy while skewering the patriarchy and feminist window-dressing."
1694,1,Gerwig didn’t just make a great movie; it’s something that will buckle the knees and tug hard on the heartstrings for generations of viewers. This is the work of a marvelous filmmaker who knows exactly what she is and wants to do.
1695,1,"Serious and lightweight at the same time, Barbie proves surprisingly successful, much like the doll that inspired."
1696,1,"Barbie is not a perfect movie, but it is a conversation, and a conversation worth having. For me, Barbie brought the unexpected pleasure of finding shared experiences in our fractured, factious age."
1697,1,"While these existential questions are refreshing in a mainstream movie, the real magic is found in how they move toward maturity: through imperfection and mistake."
1698,1,The story is simple and sweet.
1699,1,"[Gerwig] and partner Noah Baumbach have penned a very clever script that packs in humour, sadness, satire and a powerful feminist message."
1700,1,"Barbie, the movie, might make a few missteps as a feminist polemic, but it largely succeeds as a gleefully subversive look at the dehumanizing effects of inequality and how a simple idea can change the world."
1701,1,Barbie is full of laughs and lots of pink! But the one thing that stood out to me the most were the messages within the movie. While the film was very meta in many ways it brought a lot of  much needed women's rights issues to the forefront!
1702,1,"In the new film, “Barbie,” Greta Gerwig paints a world where anything is possible, where girls can realize ambitions, dream big and call the shots – not unlike the activity that has swirled around the toy for decades."
1703,0,Barbie‘s downfall is triggered by a midsection that grows less and less interesting (and more and more grating) as time progresses...
1704,1,"The film is a wicked satire of all that the Barbie franchise stands for; at the same time, it is never mean spirited. In fact, it’s a celebration. A balancing act for the ages."
1705,0,"I can’t imagine seeing it a second time, because everything is right there on the surface (except for the Mattel Easter eggs, I guess), easy to grasp and easy enough to enjoy. And that’s it."
1706,1,"Greta Gerwig, seeking to forge a distinguished persona for Barbie, one that steps beyond the corporate machinations and transnational interests of Mattel, secures a delicate equilibrium that noticeably tips in her favor."
1707,1,There's a winking sense of humor that I really enjoyed.
1708,1,"It is in many ways reverential to Barbie, and in other ways subversive. It's kind of amazing that it manages to do both."
1709,1,"This first live-action Barbie film is not, as some may assume, for kids, but more for the teenagers and adults who have played with the doll in the past"
1710,0,"This is the only Barbie movie that could have been made, and though colorful that makes it a little bland and a little sad, like staring deeply into a bowl of Lucky Charms."
1711,1,"The first forty minutes were hilarious and then it started to taper off a bit, particularly things with America's daughter. The leads did an amazing job and the musical numbers were weird and fun."
1712,1,"Kudos to Greta Gerwig for balancing a talented cast with different comedy sensibilities into a cohesive, hilarious and thought provoking film that made me examine my own biases."
1713,1,"Greta Gerwig’s pink-plastic jab at the patriarchy is one of the most subversive films of the year, possibly the decade. It's also one of the most philosophically rich."
1714,1,Barbie is a good time at the movies. The nearly two-hour runtime flies by and is jam-packed with incredible set pieces and endless imagination.
1715,1,"Gerwig’s pacey direction of her own co-written script delivers 114 minutes of neon-pink absurdity, big musical numbers, genuine belly laughs and sly, self-aware digs at popular culture."
1716,1,"At its core, Gerwig’s film delivers a surprisingly strong emotional hook in Barbie’s conundrum of being caught between her idyllic plastic life and the ever-changing, complicated real world."
1717,1,"There are many references that the movie makes to aspects of pop culture, and to discover them all one would need to give it a second look [Full review in Spanish]"
1718,1,BARBIE is a cinematic phenomenon that pulls off the rarest of feats: using a doll to make a striking commentary about gender politics. Greta Gerwig levels up as a director and writer with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling delivering career best performances.
1719,1,"It's hard to understand getting angry about a film like Barbie. It's such a joyously bonkers, rip-roaringly hilarious, and yes very pinkly-coloured piece of pure unbridled entertainment."
1720,1,This Barbie movie might be too candied and flamboyant but is certainly not silly.
1721,1,"Barbie, while far from perfect, is an unexpectedly delightful breath of fresh and campy air with a reasonably well-delivered feminist message."
1722,1,"With a final line that's one of the best in the business, Barbie shows it's possible to both deconstruct the ideal and keep the manufacturer onside with a script that is a masterful balancing act, some subtle, smart direction and some terrific actors"
1723,1,Barbie is a small miracle. [Full review in Portuguese]
1724,1,Signaling the reach and limitations of a feminist point of view beleaguered by a consumerism that assimilates and trivializes social causes... the film simultaneously mirrors it and questions it blandly. [Full review in Spanish]
1725,0,"If Barbie were made 15 or even 10 years ago I would have eaten it up like a perfectly toasted waffle with a dollop of cream. Instead, being feministsplained about the patriarchy & gender inequality every 5 minutes soured me to it"
1726,1,Better than I could have ever expected a Barbie movie to be.
1727,0,"It’s unfortunate that in a film where she goads her characters to find themselves, director Greta Gerwig's creative voice is flattened out by a corporation’s."
1728,0,"This is what happens when you don't do a satire correctly. Barbie is what happens when capitalism dictates messages about girlhood, feminism, and gender inequality."
1729,1,Gracefully combines the lightness of cotton candy entertainment with the cleverness of a well-crafted plot
1730,1,"Barbie is Gerwig’s weirdest, funniest and most bonkers film to date. Within the studio system, we should all be very grateful it exists."
1731,1,"When I became a father I searched for movies that would show my daughter positive role models, and it was tough going. Barbie makes up for lost time and should warm the hearts of parents and daughters alike."
1732,1,"...portrays the message that men need women but women, most of the time, only need themselves, but I doubt most will be offended as the harshness is done in a loving and humorous manner that we men are not supposed to understand in the first place."
1733,1,"In a world where blockbuster films are surrounded by digital landscapes, Barbie’s devotion to practical production is outstanding."
1734,1,"It might not land perfectly for every single member of its audience, but at its core, “Barbie” is a movie packed with joy, and a blast of fun at the movies this summer."
1735,1,"Barbie performs a great trick: it takes in crowds aching for fantasy and switches the script, telling them that reality and their flawed, beautiful selves is all they have to love."
1736,0,"Barbie is, at best, half a movie."
1737,1,"If you don’t like one gag, stick around, another is on the way."
1738,0,"The Barbie flick struts self-awareness, luring us all in. But humor falters by act three, like an SNL skit past its prime. Fear not, for Ryan Gosling's charismatic portrayal of Ken almost rescues the day... but not quite!"
1739,1,Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken were superb casting. They both can project a very plastic emotional shell or be internally damaged when needed.
1740,0,"Race, culture, sexuality and other parts of identity were left in its original packaging lowering the overall impact and highlighting the heavy handed focus on the gender binary."
1741,1,"It is clever and funny at times. The look of the movie, with its vibrant Barbieland colors, is a wonderful change from the bland way most movies look nowadays."
1742,1,"Slathered with satire that isn’t sugar-coated, Barbie’s message hits hard."
1743,1,"The film tries to do too much, but we can’t be anything less than deeply impressed that anyone came up with too many smart, funny, biting things to say in a movie about Barbie, of all things."
1744,1,"“Barbie” is the perfect brand to tell this story. An unexpected exploration of the value of being a human being, how we shouldn’t be solely defined by our gender and the pros and cons of both matriarchy and patriarchy"
1745,1,"This film is pink on estrogen! It is a smart, fun and important look at an American Icon. It humorously portrays male figures like Ken as accessories in Barbie Land, but the focus remains on highlighting Barbie's importance rather than vilifying men."
1746,0,"Barbie has a lot of good qualities. ... The problem is that a little amount of Barbie and Ken goes a long way, and the film eventually comes off as one-note. Barbie could have been a great Saturday Night Live skit."
1747,1,"A fearless feminist manifesto that’s perfectly wrapped in a pretty pink bow, the film is a defiant, thought-provoking, brutally honest exploration of the female experience."
1748,0,"Margot Robbie stars as Stereotypical Barbie with Ryan Gosling is her Ken, but the film doesn’t live up to the hype."
1749,1,"Gosling walks away with the film, both through the patriarchy and his hilariously sincere performance. Overall, it’s one hell of an achievement. It’s just not the one we were looking for."
1750,1,"The good news is that Barbie is an excellent film and is possibly the cinematic event of the summer. In leading their team, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig have made a smart and sunny blockbuster with something to say."
1751,0,"In trying to say too much, the film winds up not saying much at all."
1752,1,"Greta Gerwig tackles philosophical questions that are more daunting than a film based on a children’s toy can handle. It results in a strange, uneven, but beautiful movie."
1753,1,"The film goes beyond an ideological corset, yet it remains faithful to its framework as a comedy about marketing fiction. [Full review in Spanish]"
1754,1,"Just enjoy the performances by fine actors having a ball in fabulous costumes on outrageous sets. And if you or your little sisters come away with some meaty food for thought, more power to it. It can be many things to many people. That's the glory of it."
1755,1,Much deeper than its superficial pink packaging. Greta Gerwig cleverly comments on the complex gender dynamics of a popular toy brand that has so many inherent contradictions. Listen closely and you’ll hear the box office shouting: “Closer I am to fine!”
1756,0,"Barbie is strained and smug without much wit. One should bear in mind that Mattel, with revenue of $42 billion in 2022, partnered with Warner Bros. on the making of the movie."
1757,0,"Sadly, Barbie isn’t the brilliant film that many hoped it would be. The cheesy comedy often gets in the way of what could have been a very important storyline and to be honest many will expect more from a Gerwig film."
1758,0,A high-heeled Trojan horse from which it espouses all matter of feminist nonsense that is eye-rolling at best and sexist at worst.
1759,1,"Barbie, the doll, not the movie, is made of contradictions and Gerwig has done a mighty fine job of giving those contradictions the sparkliest, shiniest, warmest visual avatar."
1760,1,Greta Gerwig serves up a frothy confection of fashion and fun coupled with searing social critique of the iconic doll in the movie Barbie.
1761,1,"With a clever opening sequence and an excellent cast, Barbie manages to overcome cumbersome plotting and feminist pieties to provide a delightful spectacle of funny moments that add up to something pretty good."
1762,1,"Amid all the pink, there’s plenty of room for a think."
1763,1,"Through the film’s satirical insights about modern society, the director asks all the right questions."
1764,1,Barbie was solid -- it was a good time [with a] great message.
1765,1,'Barbie' actually turns examining the toy’s impact on generations of girls and women into its whole raison d’être.
1766,1,"For every nod and wink it offers the audience, there is also an urgent call to attention simmering beneath those barbed and razor-sharp quips and puns."
1767,1,Is Barbie a goofy romp or a heady subversion of genre?
1768,1,"The film may skew towards girls but there’s more than enough story, laughs and pratfalls for boys and their dads to embrace."
1769,1,"Gerwig’s satire and the comedic chops of Robbie and, especially, Gosling fall into perfect rhythm once Barbie and Ken leave the candy-colored comforts of Barbie Land and Ken discovers the patriarchy."
1770,1,"Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig have created an edgy, existential, empowering comedy-adventure that cleverly exposes our sexist societal shortcomings."
1771,0,The story of Barbieland’s descent into a patriarchal nightmare ... fails at the most basic level of prompting laughs. This is a mild problem for a film that is ostensibly a comedy.
1772,1,"BARBIE was always destined to deconstruct the long-lasting stereotypes around perfectionism with Barbie, but the way Greta Gerwig does that still blew away all expectations."
1773,1,"Raunchy and funny in so many wrong ways, I'm giving this film a B+ for the belly laughs it delivers."
1774,1,"It’s a real shame that [Jennifer Lawrence] spent a decade playing noted sourpuss Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games and its sequels, as she has better comic timing than just about anyone else from her age cohort."
1775,1,No Hard Feelings is for the most part good fun and makes for a witty coming of age story for both thirty-two-year-old Maddie and the teen who teaches her some unexpected life lessons.
1776,0,There is an attempt to pull this disaster out of a tailspin at the end but even the sentimentality of that moment comes across as forced. The only good thing about the final scene is that it signals this mess has come to an end.
1777,1,"No Hard Feelings does what it says on the box – and a little bit more, thanks to Lawrence, but only just a little bit."
1778,1,"If No Hard Feelings works, though, it’s largely because of the chemistry between Lawrence and Feldman. They make the dialogue fly, and both have a surprising talent for physical comedy"
1779,1,No Hard Feelings is a good time. [Full review in Spanish]
1780,1,"Though No Hard Feelings reverses some sexist clichés of the genre and explores what has changed in contemporary relationships, it doesn't completely lose the bourgeois modesty that was always the true limit of sexual comedies. [Full review in Spanish]"
1781,0,The comedy never questions having sex for money; a notable point for the comedy by co-writer and director Gene Stupnitsky. [Full review in Spanish]
1782,1,"No Hard Feelings, which plays super safe for a sex comedy, is just the medicine, as Lawrence makes patently silly scenes work with buckets of flair."
1783,0,"You’d expect an Oscar-winning actress of her popularity and stature, who presumably has her pick of material, to choose something with a little more substance than a generic sex comedy with a cringy premise."
1784,1,This frisky tale of seduction has a winning couple who add heart to the ribald laughs.
1785,1,"One of Lawrence’s most interesting characters, her vibrancy blazes beyond the film’s limitations."
1786,1,"""No Hard Feelings"" isn't the greatest comedy to come along in recent memory, but it stands out for its bold attempt to please its audience with sincerity and vulgarity. The chemistry between the leads is tangible, even if it's meant to be illogical."
1787,1,No Hard Feelings is reminiscent of 80s views on gender and comedy mixed with the charm of the early 2000s rom-com.  It is charming with enjoyable performances that hopefully will propel Jennifer Lawrence into more comedies
1788,1,"It’s a film that will make you wince, giggle, and, most importantly, feel as if you just witnessed 90 minutes of straight therapy once its credits begin to roll."
1789,0,"Despite Jennifer Lawrence's incredibly hilarious performance, No Hard Feelings is a conventional and uneven comedy that plays it too safe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
1790,1,Lawrence is a comic dream... she's such a natural here that wanting No Hard Feelings to constantly ramp up the OTT antics stems wholly from her performance.
1791,1,"It's kinda of a throwback to the raunchy comedies of the '80s & '90s... Jennifer Lawrence has good comedic timing... The first two acts work well, but it falls apart in the third act."
1792,1,"The movie frequently and cheekily emphasizes the sheer amount of work involved in maintaining some kind of glamorous movie-star mystique, even as people wonder aloud if you’re too old."
1793,0,An okay comedy. Nothing like the way it was promoted - but still a little bland.
1794,0,"JENNIFER LAWRENCE finally gets to flex her comedic chops but after the initial opening moments, the film falls apart & painfully crawls into the second half. The film struggled to find a balanced and consistent tone."
1795,1,"The best part about No Hard Feelings is that it doesn't limit itself to a ‘sex’ comedy. It turns that gaze inside and extends its purpose to an intense, meaningful romantic comedy."
1796,1,Jennifer Lawrence & Andrew Barth Feldman are a match made in comedic heaven. I laughed throughout in the theatre!
1797,1,I can recommend this film as a good solid comedy that is honestly more of a dramedy aspect of anything. This is a hard R Raunchy aspect that we don't get all too often.
1798,0,"Beyond the strong performances by Lawrence and Feldman, the film falls short and might leave audiences slightly disappointed when it comes to any further depth or thought-provoking elements."
1799,1,"Lawrence is wonderful, and the film is frequently hilarious, sporting a half-dozen outstanding comedic set-pieces"
1800,1,"No Hard Feelings isn't extraordinary... but it is a raunchy comedy reminiscent of erotic-youth ""classics"" such as American Pie or Porky's that shies away from the current compulsive search for prestige and political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]"
1801,1,"Earns big laughs, particularly from a scene of intense bravery by Lawrence that, if it wasn’t so graphic, would almost certainly play in the montage of clips at her future career achievement award ceremonies."
1802,1,"If you liked 'American Pie,' you should take a look at 'No Hard Feelings,' another raunchy comedy that might suit your taste."
1803,1,"Lawrence shows a flair for physical comedy we haven’t seen much of, and she draws strong laughs with Maddie’s clumsily slutty attempts to woo Percy."
1804,1,"Jennifer Lawrence, however, deserves a stronger script to really justify the work she’s asked to put in. She can bring the laughs (Andrew Barth Feldman can, too), but she’s expected to do too much."
1805,0,...progresses into an increasingly tedious and tiresome third act that adopts an almost incongruously sentimental feel...
1806,1,"The star turn in this screwball battle of the sexes for millenials is no-holds-barred, but the performance of her lead man as a diffident reclusive is sweetly affecting, as they bond despite it all"
1807,1,A sweetly amusing farce that could only be considered transgressive by a generation for whom 'Licorice Pizza' was their 'Last Tango in Paris.'
1808,1,"No Hard Feelings has a breezy, pleasurable quality, regardless. And let’s not forget Jennifer Lawrence, who’s as fiery as ever, bringing grit and sass to every vacillating emotion."
1809,1,"“Feelings” works despite a shaky premise, thanks in large part to Lawrence’s willingness to do anything for a laugh and a breakout performance by Andrew Barth Feldman."
1810,1,"An R-rated theatrically released comedy is a rare beast, after all. And while this film might be too bawdy for some, and it isn’t quite as strong as Stupnitsky’s other work, it’s a sterling example of sex comedy gone right."
1811,1,I love this movie.
1812,1,"This light pick-me-up of a flick is as eager to please as [Jennifer] Lawrence is to show off her luminous physical comedy skills, elevated by the star’s fiery comic timing and effortless drollness."
1813,1,"No Hard Feelings is a comeback story in multiple regards. It serves as Jennifer Lawrence‘s high-profile return and, more broadly, a test of the sustainability of comedies on the theatrical scene."
1814,1,"A nice and effective mix between sweet rom-com and raunchy comedy, led by Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence, who's great in ""all-in"" mode. Fun stuff. [Full review in Spanish]"
1815,1,"It is a surprisingly funny film, with an unexpectedly effective comic duo... [Full review in Spanish]"
1816,1,No Hard Feelings is a good and funny time to spend a few hours in the summer.
1817,0,"The relationship between Maddie and Percy feels forced as her attempts to get his attention are so aggressive and manic. The film attempts to balance raunchy comedy with a heartfelt coming-of-age story, but ultimately doesn’t do anything special."
1818,1,"The movie was cute, predictable, enjoyable. I chuckled. I had myself a good time."
1819,1,"Elevated by strong performances and buoyed by the relative dearth of mainstream comedy films these past several years, No Hard Feelings is worth a trip to the theater for Jennifer Lawrence fans and those simply in the mood for a good laugh."
1820,1,"While it's a predictable been-there-done-that comedy with some eye-rolling ridiculous moments, I somehow did find myself genuinely guffawing more than once and JLaw brings it whatever the role."
1821,1,A coming of age story that has some raunchy humor BUT also a tender heart.
1822,0,... the movie gets more and more solemn and talky and full of lesson-learning.
1823,1,"The movie has plenty of big bawdy laughs, many courtesy of Jennifer Lawrence's fearless performance."
1824,1,"No Hard Feelings is the antithesis of family friendly, but perfectly treads the line between risqué and offensive. One minute you’re laughing to the point of tears, the next you’re asking yourself, “Am I a bad person?”"
1825,1,No Hard Feelings manages to capture how two people with different backgrounds and levels of experience can still connect in a way that's not solely about the physical
1826,1,"Despite it being about some troubled and sometimes mean-spirited people, the movie does have its high points and some really funny cringey humor. It's very of its time and pretty fun - even if a little predictable and a throwback to less sensitive times."
1827,1,"While Lawrence has the film’s best jokes and storyline, the movie works only because of the equally effective comedic turn of A Tourist’s Guide to Love‘s Feldman."
1828,1,"There's a reason why Jennifer Lawrence is one of the youngest Oscar winners. She plays Maddie with such nuance and complexity, and delivers a performance that will make viewers forget the shadiness of the film's premise."
1829,1,"I am about to recommend a mildly raunchy R-rated comedy for one simple reason: I had fun watching it. I am so sick and tired of overlong, overproduced, formulaic “content” that this insignificant movie looks like a work of genius in comparison."
1830,0,"It appears to be a raucous sex comedy, but it ends up sentimental and predictable."
1831,1,"While the film favors sweetness over raunch in a way that makes for a messy third act, Lawrence’s performance holds it all together with real heart."
1832,1,"No Hard Feelings doesn’t mean any harm, and more power to it."
1833,1,No Hard Feelings is a welcome addition to a dwindling genre — and a reminder that Lawrence is one of Hollywood's best (and funniest) leads.
1834,1,"A refreshing blast of raucous, grown-up comedy infuses what is actually a sweet coming-of-age journey for an oddball couple."
1835,1,"It’s a journey for both characters to venture together to discover they both are worth more as people. It may sound like many conclusions before it, and it indeed is. But you’ll get a kick out of how these characters reach it."
1836,0,"[An] amusing but instantly forgettable romp. The unstoppable force of Lawrence’s charisma notwithstanding, this is not so much tasteless, just a bit bland."
1837,1,"Questions abound -- about sex, class and basic morality -- and an R-rated comedy like this one might seem ill-equipped to handle them. What a pleasant surprise, then, to find that the movie has more going on under its hood."
1838,1,"Yet for all its juvenile-yet-adults-only antics, No Hard Feelings lives up to its title, offering a surprisingly sentimental take on the unlikely relationship at its core."
1839,0,"This is a clichéd, dreary and often just plain pitiful attempt at a comedy about women, directed by Gene Stupnitsky, which doesn’t use the wonderful skills of the actress."
1840,0,"If it isn’t going to deliver on the raunch, No Hard Feelings could at least deliver on quality, and it does not."
1841,0,"None of No Hard Feelings’s big set piece scenes works, largely because Percy hasn’t been conceived as anything other than the butt of the joke, and the mean-spiritedness leaves the film with nowhere to go."
1842,0,"The premise is never once credible, and director and co-writer Gene Stupnitsky peppers this astoundingly unfunny film with implausible set pieces that have clip-worthy kudos and nothing else."
1843,0,"It’s a romantic comedy so feebly constructed, so lazily written, so devoid of wit and charm, that the ghost of Billy Wilder must be choking on his celestial cigar."
1844,1,"... The film runs off with a crazy premise that respects the principles of the genre and reverses gender roles, mastering the 'hot slapstick', and if not, there's the wild night scene on the beach. [Full review in Spanish]"
1845,1,"Thank goodness for No Hard Feelings, in which Lawrence looks like she’s having the most fun she’s ever had on-screen, finally releasing the pent-up screwball energy she’s never been able to fully channel into her characters before."
1846,1,... A modern screwball comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
1847,1,This felt like a genuine callback to some of my favorite comedies. Jennifer Lawrence should be doing more roles like this!
1848,0,No Hard Feelings is a comedy looking in vain for an audience.
1849,1,"It’s a throwback with a modern twist, headlined by a star who isn’t afraid to be goofy, silly, and sincere – sometimes that’s all a movie really needs to succeed."
1850,1,"The supporting cast is strong, there are plenty of wonderful set pieces, and Lawrence throws herself into all this ribald madness with gleefully intoxicating abandon."
1851,0,"Jennifer Coolidge's Stifler's mom in ""American Pie"" was a fun cougar. J-Law's Maddie Barker in ""No Hard Feelings"" won't exactly make you reach for your phone to call child protective services, but the thought will cross your mind."
1852,1,A raunchy comedy.
1853,1,"Once you get over what is a sex-worker-for-hire-on-Craigslist story, JLaw has a lotta cojones in taking this into the harsh light of Hard-R-rated land. But why must we learn lessons & have a redundant happy ending? And why is Matthew B. now Cameron's Dad?"
1854,1,"Doesn’t re-invent the wheel, but it’s a hilarious, fun, and raunchy comedy entry with a star that makes it look so easy."
1855,1,The story focuses more on friendship than it does on sex. It's actually a very sweet film.
1856,1,"The game of ping pong that [Jennifer Lawrence] and [Andrew Barth Feldman] play ... is irresistible fun, and the walls they've both respectively built are joyously picked apart in the most unexpected comedy of the summer."
1857,0,"Jennifer Lawrence is all in, but Oscar winner can't save conflicted comedy."
1858,0,"With jerky tonal shifts to make you feel as though you’re experiencing repeated whiplash, the movie veers off course in several directions that don’t make very much sense – not that we expect this format to be remotely plausible."
1859,1,"Jennifer Lawrence gives 110% in a gutsy performance and Andrew Barth Feldman plays his part to perfection. It may be a bit watered down for young adults, but perfect for older moviegoers. Did you just walk out of a feel-good comedy? Yep."
1860,1,No Hard Feelings has more heart and relatability than just about any other film I’ve seen from a Hollywood studio so far this year; it also has more laughs per minute than most of them as well.
1861,1,"No Hard Feelings is a coming of age story told through two vastly different perspectives. This R-rated raunchy comedy may not always land, but the film excels with the relationships developed between characters and the performances leading the way."
1862,1,No Hard Feelings is equally heartfelt and hilarious and will stick in the memory long after other modern comedies have come and gone. At the very least you’ll never look at someone getting suplexed the same way again.
1863,1,The film gets its big laughs but is ultimately a much sweeter (and even sadder) story that really comes to life thanks to the performances by Lawrence and Feldman as well as being one of the better eat-the-rich commentaries we have seen lately.
1864,1,Lawrence energy and likeability navigates around some of the script’s sloppier choices.
1865,0,"Not even J-Law off the nice-young-lady leash can save something this lazy and desperate to offend, however. The movie simply isn’t on her level. Or really much of any level at all."
1866,1,"Credit Lawrence with finding a worthwhile character in a movie that offers unexpected rewards for those who’ll see it, whether that’s in theaters or, more likely, after it wades into the more hospitable waters of pay TV and streaming"
1867,1,"No Hard Feelings is raunchy, refreshing, and heartfelt. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect these types of films. It falters a bit in the last act, but still quite funny and enjoyable."
1868,1,Letting Jennifer Lawrence have fun in a movie like this was nice to see. No Hard Feelings isn’t a perfect movie but it’s fun and we all deserve some pure dumb enjoyment.
1869,1,The raunchy comedy lurches from chuckle-funny to cringeworthy.
1870,1,"The R-rated, hit-and-miss romp has just enough wit and heart to carry the day over the utterly predictable plot and the occasional bit of physical comedy that misses the mark."
1871,0,The movie’s central failing is that the comedic elements aren’t as consistent or funny as they should be.
1872,1,"Percy, played with beguiling innocence and good will by a likable Feldman, may be unprepared for life, but he possesses a pure heart and an idealized view of love and sex. You want the best for him."

1908,1,I was especially taken by the performance of Greta Lee and the supporting work of John Magaro.
1909,0,"It has the singularity of discussing lack of communication, nostalgia and past love in times of urban alienation, but the characters remain in overly sanitized situations that, little by little, dissolve the layer of intimacy.  [Full review in Spanish]"
1910,1,"The entire film is punctuated by memorable sequences that function as warnings, as signs or, better yet, as clocks. [Full review in Spanish]"
1911,1,"With Past Lives, writer and director Song delivers a beautiful and impeccable film where everything is perfectly measured. [Full review in Spanish]"
1912,1,"In Song's film, delicacy, sensitivity and empathy towards her characters reign. [Full review in Spanish]"
1913,0,"Past Lives does not contribute much more to love, cinema and spirituality than what a luxurious Sunday article in an elegant magazine offers to sophistication."
1914,1,"With such a simple plot, full of silences, looks, and small gestures... in her debut, playwright Celine Song composes a story that speaks of the great evils and good of today, of identity, of frustration. [Full review in Spanish]"
1915,1,"A certainly a well-acted, well directed movie that shows that Celine Song can handle emotion (even sentimentality if you prefer) quite well, in a style that could as well dictate how romantic movies proceed from now on."
1916,1,"It is subtle, not heavy-handed. It is low-key, without gigantic emotional fireworks. There is real emotion, which finally is revealed, but it is just under the surface most of the time. This is a very well-written and acted film."
1917,1,"This all sounds rather cryptic, and the film is mysterious. It is also lucid and precise, intimately devoted to its strange lyrical sorrow. It’s as if we are watching feelings in slow motion."
1918,1,"An elegant and unexpectedly mesmerizing character piece that speaks profoundly to the concept of love in the modern age while using an intelligent and ambitious, but still very relatable woman to do so."
1919,1,"Taking her time to develop characters and relationships, Song deftly brings the audience deep into the narrative until we are fully invested in the eventual outcome."
1920,1,"Ultimately, we are all living the same lives, the same experiences, the same feelings. The film exploits the fact that coincidences don't exist and expands the potential of the eternal human question, ""what if?"". Masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]"
1921,1,"The images and the characters’ spatial relationships within them become such a part of the story that, in the final act, simple moments like an awkward silence at a bar or waiting for an Uber transmit tremendous power."
1922,1,"Subtle and understated, if occasionally mundane, romantic drama, that reflects our complicated lives in a universal story about the life choices, and sweeps you away in its final climactic moments"
1923,1,"Past Lives is based above all on two long scenes in which the characters talk, and while they do so, they evoke the wounds of time's passage. [Full review in Spanish]"
1924,1,"This is, possibly, the film that has shaken me the most in the last decade, and it does so not with exaggerated moments of screams and drama, but with the perfect words to rock you into its small cosmos... [Full review in Spanish]"
1925,1,"Its greatness doesn't so much immediately grab you by the throat but worms its way into your affections more and more with each passing scene, building and building until it becomes impossible to deny in its note-perfect final act."
1926,1,"Past Lives is notable for what it leaves out. It is a drama of accommodation, a minimalist romance in which the spectre of a grand passion is held tantalisingly at bay."
1927,1,"A sublime, aching meditation on memory and time, practical love and idealistic romance, and all the complex contradictions that exist in between."
1928,1,"This gorgeous, life-affirming feature is one of the best I’ve seen this year."
1929,1,"Past Lives is Song’s first movie, but it feels more like her ninth — it’s wonderfully assured."

1931,1,"Past Lives may be a weepie, but it’s a hyper-sophisticated one."
1932,1,"Plaudits to the principal cast, who do a miraculous job of portraying inner conflict and ecstasy with the merest tilt of a head, or subtle shift of a shoulder."
1933,1,"A quietly devastating drama, Past Lives might be one of the early contenders for next year’s Oscars, and is certainly one of the best films you’ll see all year. Watch it before the awards season chatter begins."
1934,1,Song finds the political in the personal and avoids seeming indulgent or niche.
1935,1,The film’s great magic is the way it captures the beauty of lonely cities with a camera that seems to caress their geography.
1936,1,"There’s a certain tragedy at the heart of this story that no amount of goodwill can soothe: sometimes you don’t get over traumas, you just learn to live with them. But Past Lives, a thoroughly grown-up film, is able to accommodate this inconvenient truth."
1937,1,"Aesthetically, too, the film is gorgeous -- like something you want to reach out and touch."
1938,1,"If you are looking for some grown up romance, don’t let Past Lives get away."
1939,1,It’s barely believable that this is Song’s very first feature. Her film is simply sublime from start to finish.
1940,1,"It is highly recommended as a touching and always subtle film about old memories, old friendships and contemporary realities."
1941,1,The performances are impossibly strong and awards-season ready. Anything other than a best actress Oscar nomination for Lee will be criminal.
1942,1,It is a film that embraces blended nationalities while acknowledging the pull of one’s earliest home. One leaves aware of unavoidable open-endedness but sated by a work that has achieved all its lofty ambitions.
1943,1,"Past Lives isn’t quite the woozy, lovelorn drama that its trailers have sold... But it is an eloquent attempt to understand how our memories can end up turning other people into projection screens for our own, confused desires."
1944,1,"Past Lives is breathtaking, leaving you speechless in the most wonderful way."
1945,1,"A little movie with the biggest of hearts, Past Lives heralds the arrival of playwright turned director Céline Song as a filmmaker with the brightest of futures. It's the most charming of debuts, and if you miss it, your screen life will be the poorer."
1946,1,"There is always a forward momentum to the film even when nothing much seems to be happening. All the scenario's emotional complexity, though, is articulated by the actors’ expressions."
1947,1,"That it’s exquisitely affecting and made with great precision and care is enough for now. No need to make a song and dance about it. Indeed, as Past Lives so deftly shows, you can have an excellent drama without any of the drama."
1948,1,"I've never quite seen a love story or a friendship bond told on screen like Past Lives, I was enthralled  with the film, easily one of the best of the year."
1949,1,It’s a must-see.
1950,1,"Past Lives is not only a breath-taking debut by Celine Song, it is a herald to an astounding voice in cinema."
1951,0,"Past Lives is naggingly unsatisfying: the characters are not fully realised, and nor is their story. The film anticipates an impact it doesn’t earn."
1952,1,"A transcendent debut for South Korean-Canadian filmmaker Celine Song, this romantic drama is a masterclass in slow, simmering storytelling. It will stay with you, maybe even into your next life."
1953,1,Celine Song’s directorial debut is a beautiful story of friendship & contemplation about the choices we make in life. It is powerfully relatable and the film shows us that it’s okay to be sad about the road not taken without having regrets.
1954,1,"In Past Lives, director Celine Song twists the knife on the all-too-familiar romantic woes that Asian immigrants like myself endure: the slow yet gut-wrenching impact of long-distance relationships and our complex relationship with fate."
1955,1,A tender and mesmerising romance with an absolutely sensational lead performance from Lee.
1956,1,"It is a movie that carries the weight of years upon its shoulders, of ineffable longing and the possibility of cosmic alignment, but it does so with a cinematic spring in its step."
1957,1,"The film's directness, its relative storytelling simplicity, is also its asset. Past Lives unravels at a rhythm that weaves a slow-burning spell, one that allows an audience the space to project their own experience onto the screen."
1958,1,"The masterstroke of Song’s screenplay is that, despite its emotional directness, there is still ample room to reinterpret character dynamics up to and including the devastating final moments."
1959,1,The bittersweet reconnecting of childhood soulmates wraps an unrealised love story in unanswerable questions.
1960,1,"One of the best written screenplays for a long, long time. It has a Woody Allen feel to it that just makes it a masterpiece."
1961,1,"It’s quite the remarkable first film for Song, who brings a tender, elegant economy to her storytelling that doesn’t quite prepare you for how much it’ll wipe you out at the closing stretch. This one aches really good, folks. I can’t shake it."
1962,1,"Like few others, Past Lives shows the cultural and emotional dichotomy of those of us who have left our countries of origin and never completely detach ourselves from them, no matter how many years go by... [Full review in Spanish]"
1963,1,"For this is as much a story of her [Nora] wrestling with the importance of her Korean heritage, as it is any romantic notions of fate, destiny or, as the Koreans call it, in-yun."
1964,1,"A small, sweet but ultimately soulful film, a triumph for Celine Song and a beautifully unwrapped gift for audiences."
1965,1,"… starts slow but then ramps up into an absolute stunner of a romantic drama, populated by fleshed-out and endlessly likeable characters who explore deeply relatable aspects of loves and lives that could have been."
1966,1,"Every shot is well-considered, every line of dialogue neatly parsed, each performance exquisitely choreographed to convey a thoroughly conceived idea in a naturalistic style. It’s a lovely, lovely film, and one of the year’s best."
1967,1,"A love story that will linger on your mind for a long, long to come."
1968,1,"This delicate and eloquent meditation on destiny and choice is an emotional experience, beautifully played."
1969,1,"This is the real deal. If you’ve an interest in five-star contemporary cinema, you miss this at your peril."
1970,1,"This is a film that understands the dopamine rush of digital connection, but also the way it can be used to prolong the blissed-out potential of a relationship by repeatedly deferring a real-world encounter."
1971,1,"[F]or all the talk of in-yun, the true past life is the one Nora left behind in Korea[.]"
1972,1,"Celine Song’s tender, time-spanning romance is an exquisitely judged wonder. A directorial debut of remarkable poise and power."
1973,1,Past Lives should not be missed.
1974,0,"It’s fine for a movie not to spell everything out, in fact, it’s preferable. But in Past Lives, Nora’s opacity left me uninvolved at times."
1975,1,"Past Lives is a film about time, missed opportunities and enduring connections, and Song ably juxtaposes private reflection with romantic longing."
1976,1,"Past Lives is the epitome of contemplative, meditative cinema."
1977,1,"Song’s masterful direction and ability to tell a story mostly visually make Past Lives a masterpiece. It’s an eloquent, alluring film about what we leave behind and what we gain from it."
1978,1,"There’s something transcendent about this story, which captures the bigness of human existence in a way that leaves you in awe, and maybe helps you understand love and loss and life a little better."
1979,1,"Culturally specific yet universally resonant, this bittersweet Korean drama is a quietly perceptive and deeply profound look at unspoken relationship bonds."
1980,1,"Past Lives is a heartrending and deeply felt examination of two souls linked together, that while leaving an enduring impact on each other’s lives, are destined to be apart."
1981,1,"“Who do you think they are to each other?” The question echoes as the film’s ending returns to the bar where it was initially asked. Perhaps a better question is, what does it mean to know someone?"
1982,1,"Past Lives is a sonic-visual feast in the service of a deeply moving, revelatory treatise on subtle human truths...it’s easily one of the best films of the year, if not, the best."
1983,1,Celine Song presents an intimate and delicate three-decade-spanning portrait of the importance people play in our lives that resembles Richard Linklater’s Before trilogy.
1984,1,"Past Lives is a emotional experience like no other! Nearly every moment in this film felt real and layered with so many earnest emotions, and it captures that haunting and heartbreaking reality of “what if” PERFECTLY!"
1985,1,Past Lives is schematic but effective; what makes it work are the performances by Greta Lee and Teo Yoo as these star-crossed not-quite lovers’ adolescent and adult incarnations.
1986,1,Past Lives is the sort of thing that might blow a hole in your chest if you hold regrets about roads not taken.
1987,1,"A24’s Past Lives is a masterpiece & lives up to everything you’ve heard about it already. Truly a romance for the ages that will break your heart, bring it back together, & then touch your soul."
1988,1,"Past Lives is quietly powerful – an understated examination of longing, connection, and unconsummated love."
1989,1,"The tug of Past Lives is situated in the many moments that come together to shape the film into a meaningful whole about love—lost and found, abandoned and claimed."
1990,1,"It celebrates the people who leave an indelible mark, regardless of time and distance. What's truly astonishing is how a film this levelheaded can still break your heart into a million tiny pieces."
1991,1,"Whether you find Past Lives mesmerizing or not, its portrait of relationships rings true -- and could inspire bouts of soul searching."
1992,1,Nary a dishonest note to be found in this mesmerizing film.
1993,1,"An absolutely beautiful film, that never collapses into cliche."
1994,1,"As Nora, Greta Lee, gives a complex, nuanced performance that understates and fully reveals the depth of her emotions."
1995,1,Past Lives is one of those rare films that charms audiences with its subtle beauty but wins them over with its immense intelligence and heart.
1996,1,"""[Celine] Song knows that sometimes to preserve the purity of an eternal love story is to leave it incomplete. After all, believers in romance will often tell you, there’s always a next life."""
1997,1,Past Lives has an autobiographical touch and offers a memorable cinematic experience well worth having.
1998,1,"Past Lives is an emotional powerhouse. It's a romance that’s not meant to be, and a film built on the immigrant experience and the power of empathy and honesty in difficult situations."
1999,1,"A bitingly poignant film about heartache, time, longing, childhood friendship and finding closure."
2000,1,"PAST LIVES is sexy and funny and tender along its seemingly familiar path, but it never ignores the mundane truth that destiny, more often than not, keeps people apart. Reality isn't a fairy tale."
2001,1,"It is an embrace of every hitch and hiccup, every misstep and missed opportunity that led you to be who you are. It is a dirge, an elegy for who others saw you to be but who you never were. It is an innocent idea, a dangerous daydream, a painful pleasure."
2002,1,"The MVP here is John Magaro, who delivers a quietly devastating performance as Nora’s husband, Arthur."
2003,1,"It is an honest introspection that explores gut-wrenching concepts of regret and destiny, asking us to ponder the consequences of choices."
2004,1,"Bookended by two departures, Celine Song’s delicate debut Past Lives, in which a woman finds herself torn between two men, is less about the longing for someone you moved away from and more about the version of yourself that you left behind with them."
2005,1,"Song juggles so many tricky and often conflicting emotions, then deftly wraps them in a delicate but devastating package. It's a dreamy, melancholy, and altogether remarkable debut."
2006,1,"Practical, logical, and infinitely moving in its humanity. [Full review in Spanish]"
2007,1,"It’s not about “taking the road less travelled” as Frost would tell with a sigh, but the road not taken that keeps the traveller thinking what could have been."
2008,1,"With the support of executive producer Taika Waititi, first-time feature writer and director Billy Luther’s semi-autobiographical, gentle coming-of-age story offers an understated, seldom seen slice of quotidian Native American life"

2010,1,"It’s a bittersweet tale with moments of genuine connection between the characters, as well as sections of real profundity."
2011,1,"...faithful to the approach Benny attributes to his grandmother in his opening narration (voiced by Luther): “In Navajo storytelling, symbols mean more than facts, and time means nothing at all.” |"
2012,1,[The] film’s gentle approach to storytelling ... and unhurried affect imbues small moments with outsized significance.
2013,1,"Gentle comfort is something the entire world is in need of these days, and “Frybread Face and Me” delivers that in abundance."
2014,1,"Frybread Face and Me features a guileless and charismatic young male in the lead, the “me” of the title, but the standout here has to be the fantastic Hogan, whose story perhaps this really is."
2015,1,An exceptional coming-of-age film that captures the beauty of self-discovery.
2016,1,"Luther therefore deals with some heavy-ish subject matter throughout without shining too bright a light on it. The film is playing with familiar tropes along a formulaic path, but it’s simply too endearing to dismiss outright."
2017,1,"A triumph. It's a remarkable artistic and thematic journey back in time to when we were eleven, reviving those innocent feelings. a beautiful helping of magic, gentleness, learning, humor, and the absolute importance of family."
2018,1,"...a gentle, lighthearted coming-of-age story that benefits from its solid performances and engaging atmosphere..."

2021,1,"A gentle, poignantly narrated queer coming-of-age drama, “Frybread Face and Me” provides nice insights by creating meaning with symbols, such as a Navajo rug, that express life’s possibilities."
2022,1,"It’s the heartfelt sentiment behind this sweetly imperfect film, which features a charming Native American cast and a story that amplifies Indigenous voices through cinema, that makes it feel so special."
2023,1,Frybread Face and Me is a touching coming-of-age story brimming with authenticity and the passion of its creator.
2024,1,"Watching this family interact is a reminder how rare it is to see so many American indigenous actors in a space, weaving the unique and universal into stories that expand our storehouse of their experience."
2025,1,"On paper, the film is quite a simple concept, but Luther takes the building blocks of a strong coming-of-age story and builds something that will undoubtedly leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside."
2026,1,"The relatively light touch gives “Frybread and Me” a cumulative power as it rolls along, reflecting a way of life where both tragedy and celebration aren’t treated as major events but part of a continuum making any effort to break the cycle feel big."

2035,1,The film can be enjoyed as irrefutable proof of what can be done with this type of proposal when placed in the right hands.  [Full review in Spanish]
2036,1,"Cruise's motorcycle stunt is exciting exactly the way thrillers should be exciting. You know that you’re watching a movie, but also you forget that you’re watching a movie."

2038,1,"McQuarrie and Cruise seem very aware that their storytelling beats are a metaphor for moviemaking: meticulously prepare and plan, vamp wildly when something goes wrong, and brazen it out before the fade to black."
2039,1,"Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is the summer blockbuster you’ve been waiting on. Once again, Cruise delivers a great cast to real locations, amid beautifully crafted action sets."
2040,1,"The only impossible mission is keeping Tom Cruise away from this spy franchise, and quite frankly, that’s not a bad thing."
2041,1,"It takes off ... at a full-tilt run, a nimble, entertaining thriller that zings along thanks to crackerjack action sequences and the chemistry of its cast."
2042,1,"Meeting the canons of the saga while taking the form of an artful spectacle, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was the most expensive and longest film of the series, but is far from being an extraordinary achievement."
2043,0,"""Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One"" is a fine excuse to sit in an air conditioned movie theater for a few hours in the midst of summer, but it's not as good as any of the franchise's predecessors.  ColeSmithey.com"
2044,0,"For all its efforts to topple Bond by mirroring/homaging the stunts that came out some 40 years ago, Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One ultimately is but a shadow of something much more interesting and worthy of a Friday night viewing."

2047,1,"There are some great villains, co-conspirators, strange bedfellows and events that will keep you guessing. By the end of the movie I was literally on the edge of my seat wondering who would still be standing and make it to part two."
2048,1,Tom Cruise understands better than anyone how to make a great action movie. Dead Reckoning Part One is the perfect summer action movie.
2049,1,"Cruise is fine as the ever-cool, superhuman Hunt, but the supporting cast gives the film its oomph. Hayley Atwell stands out, sexy and charismatic as Hunt’s new romantic interest, Grace, a thief."

2059,1,"A 163-minute runtime rarely feels this light, thanks to the contributions of the sublime cast - Hayley Atwell is outstanding - and the truly memorable score that elevates all the otherworldly set pieces."
2060,1,This is going to meet all of the expectations.
2061,1,"What makes ""Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One"" compelling is its stranglehold over beautifully shot action scenes complimenting an otherwise convoluted premise surrounding artificial intelligence."
2062,1,"Like the last several ""Mission: Impossible"" films, this one proves to be an exceptionally competent action-thriller full of beautiful set pieces and spectacular stunts from Cruise himself."
2063,1,"Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie just have the visual language for these films perfected by now, as you can tell they both feel fierce devotion to pushing every single limit for what stunts won’t get Cruise in trouble if he attempts them."
2064,1,"MI7 once again shows up the rest of this year's big CGI-heavy action blockbusters (again, except John Wick 4) on almost every level, and it often does so through very similar set pieces."
2065,1,"Tom Cruise continues to deliver a sequel that is equal, if not better, than the last."
2066,0,"Dead Reckoning is as advertised. A bombastic summer blockbuster that will put butts in seats, but will likely be forgotten before Dead Reckoning Part Two reaches theatres."
2067,1,"This has been a remarkably consistent series in terms of quality, with only that dopey Mission: Impossible II preventing a perfect record."
2068,1,"Cruise commands this exhilarating espionage thriller in full force. Its colossal action sequences and stunts are breathtaking, while its debate around the autonomy of machines is timely. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2069,1,...a consistently watchable blockbuster that fares better than the majority of similarly-themed contemporary releases...
2070,1,[A] testosterone soap opera ... If you can let your inhibitions go out the moving train then Dead Reckoning Part One will delight.
2071,1,The kind of movie spectacle that always looks best on the biggest and brightest of silver screens.
2072,1,"Like a motorcycle leaping off a mountain, this movie has very high highs and very low lows... But as soon as the action started, especially the last action set pieces, I could've rolled right into the sequel immediately."
2073,1,"While Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One is exceptional for action movie standards, it’s frustratingly middling for Mission: Impossible standards."
2074,1,"The familiarity is part of the game, of course: Introducing enough new stunts and beautiful faces to wow the crowds while taking ownership over the iconography to keep others from snatching it away."
2075,1,"The stunts are enough to make it a good time… They’re not enough to make it a great movie, or even a great Mission: Impossible movie. Like its AI villain, Reckoning may have become too self aware."
2076,1,"Doesn’t quite hit the same levels as Rogue Nation and Fallout. However, it still delivers an incredible action-packed film with compelling characters that manage to bring both moments of extreme tension and laughs."
2077,1,"There is very little doubt that Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part 1 is a very impressive film, but the good news is it a combination of some smart script writing, impressive stunts and great acting that makes it that way."
2078,1,Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is EXHILARATING. It’s impossible to fathom how this cast and crew manage to create these edge of your seat action set pieces that some how one up each other. This felt the closest to Brian De Palma 96 Mission.
2079,1,"With another strong outing, The Mission: Impossible series proves that it represents the pinnacle of blockbuster filmmaking."
2080,1,"""A real reversal of what we might consider socially acceptable."""
2081,1,"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One is absolutely a mixed bag of tricks. The high points are stratospheric, but the low ones are frequently head-scratching."
2082,1,"Forget best movie of the summer, it's the best movie of the year."
2083,1,Tom Cruise takes the franchise to new heights with breathtaking - soul snatching stunts.  Hayley Atwell steals the show...literally
2084,1,"Tom Cruise's stunts are a 5/5, but Dead Reckoning Pt 1 has a particular scene that is so detrimental to one of the best characters, that it took me out of the film."
2085,1,The new Mission Impossible is the summer movie we've all been waiting for.
2086,1,We all must agree that one of the best things about the new Mission: Impossible films is their selection of badass women with powerful on-screen magnetism.
2087,1,"Mission Impossible—Dead Reckoning: Part One has jaw-dropping action that inspires awe. While entertaining with solid chemistry, parts of the movie feels flat."
2088,1,"Tom Cruise reprises his now iconic role of IMF agent Ethan Hunt, giving yet another powerhouse physical performance that reaffirms his status as the most enduring (and best) action star in the business."
2089,1,"As energetic as one dares to hope a popcorn movie might be, in love with the capacity of movies to provide every sort of visual delight."
2090,1,"An extremely lively, stupid, grotesque, and entertaining experience. [Full review in Spanish]"
2091,1,The franchise remains undefeated.
2092,1,"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One  honestly dropped my jaw. McQuarrie infuses Tech Paranoia, Hitchcocking intensity, white knuckle action set pieces that remind you why movies like this *MUST* Be seen in theaters."
2093,1,"MI7 does offer summer escape but I can't help but think what a really efficient, fast-paced actioner Dead Reckoning could of been if it had been conceived as a single movie."
2094,1,"Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is more than just a movie for me. It’s one more well of motivation that’s keeping me from succumbing to the immeasurable forces at play, i.e., the algorithm gods and their fanatics."
2095,1,"As expected from a Mission Impossible film, the action sequences, stunts and fight scenes are top tier. Cruise hasn’t lost a beat, still performing his own stunts, kicking ass and running around with Usain Bolt type speed."
2096,1,Franchise still delivers out-of-this-world stunts but screenplay needs work.
2097,0,"How do you come up with a worthy adversary for someone who demonstrably thinks of themselves as infallible? Tom Cruise has solved his own problem; in the impossible-to-follow Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One, he takes on God Himself."
2098,1,Mission: Impossible remains a unicorn amongst action franchises either topping or closely masking what has come before. This team and its leaders in Cruise and McQuarrie are delivering action spectacle like few others and this is no exception.
2099,1,"The latest installment of ""Tom Cruise's Jackass"" is a blast!"
2100,1,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, Part One may not be the best film you'll see this year but it's most certainly a film you won't easily forget."
2101,1,"Adrenaline-pumping sequences, flirtatious interludes, high pitch drama and a save-the-world plot do their jobs. However, something about the process doesn’t feel new."
2102,1,"Kudos to Cruise for knowing his audience and how to please it. He nails a nearly impossible mission: becoming the summer’s box office savior riding a sequel, again, while performing stunts that would terrify actors half his age."
2103,1,"The third act more than makes up for lost momentum with its stupendous stunts that Cruise nails, A tip of the hat to the greatest risk taker in Hollywood history, surpassing early practitioners Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. Breathtaking."
2104,1,"Tom Cruise once again puts his life on the line, diving into the stuntwork with gusto while adding some underlying moodiness as a secret agent whose job might be getting to him. Above all, it's a thunderously entertaining movie."
2105,1,"With thrilling action sequences, a talented cast and a fearless leading man, Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is an absolute blast. One of the best action movies you'll see this year."
2106,1,"Mission Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One has all the bells and whistles as McQuarrie and Cruise deliver on another great film.  Incredible sound and production throughout, strong stunts, a compelling story and an amazing score are all present."
2107,1,Cruise and McQuarrie have once again collaborated to make a poster boy summer blockbuster that lovingly embraces what makes the big screen experience so uniquely special.
2108,1,"McQuarrie’s lasting contribution is a style of intensely pressurized efficiency. His films push the Mission: Impossible franchise away from espionage melodrama and toward a spectacle of function, of situation and action over emotion and impact."
2109,1,"A crowd-pleaser and then some. This mission, to pull the theatrical experience of cinema back from the edge of death, is an amazing hat trick that combines the tangible with the abstract. Alchemy? Almost."
2110,1,"Cruise skating by the skin of his teeth, and narrowly escaping would-be captors and death dealers alike, feels more like a Chaplin boxing match than any boringly grounded contemporary superhero feat."
2111,1,"The first half of Ethan Hunt's sizable final adventure isn't without its narrative shortcomings, but it does immerse you fully in accepting the mission with new backstory, characters, and a state of the art villain, buoyed by amazing action spectacle."
2112,1,"McQuarrie and Cruise deliver the must-see movie of the summer. Astonishing stunts and practical effects, a well-timed narrative, humor, and Esai Morales as a series-best villain."
2113,1,"Dead Reckoning Part One is a vigorous dose of action filmmaking at its finest, due in no small part to Cruise and McQuarrie pushing themselves further with each entry."
2114,1,Well-executed thriller that's all spectacle and no substance.
2115,1,Stingy with the stunts...
2116,1,"Action set pieces and visceral action make Dead Reckoning an ideal blockbuster. However, enough goes wrong in Dead Reckoning to leave it as one of the weakest entries in the very good franchise."
2117,0,"Cruise's latest slice of intercontinental intrigue will have you experiencing déjà vu all over again, not only because it trots out the oft-filmed scenarios, but because he stopped doing the very thing that kept the franchise on its toes."
2118,1,"It's the ultimate proof that Cruise has become Mr. Movies (™)—THE Hollywood star who knows exactly how to lure us to the big screen, justifying the existence of this kind of ridiculously budgeted blockbuster. Full review in Spanish."
2119,1,"Dead Reckoning Part One is (so far) the cumulative masterpiece of the M:I franchise, featuring a plot that’s very timely while immersing itself in elements from the series’ past."
2120,1,"It’s dopey but thrilling, and I recommend seeing it on the biggest screen possible while you still have the chance."
2121,1,Top-notch action hides a whisper-thin plot for a great summer action thrill ride.
2122,1,"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning, Part One honors the filmmaking techniques of yesteryear while injecting them with invigorating contemporary freshness. [Full review in Spanish]"
2123,1,"Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I boasts some of the best action footage you'll see this year. Moreover, a strong cast adds enough nuance to keep the story from seeming like an excuse to vault from one dizzying set piece to the next."
2124,1,"There are no new surprises in the new MI instalment -- in fact, McQuarrie assembles the film more as a fan than like a maker, distilling it down to its greatest pleasures."
2125,1,“Reckoning” is the film of the summer -- an old school throwback to the bygone days of action blockbusters.
2126,0,"Reducing cinema to gimmicky sensationalism is regressive, especially when McQuarrie’s repetition is this witlessly conventional."
2127,1,"Dead Reckoning Part One is reliably great. But like many recent Cruise-led projects, it’s also deeply concerned with the future of cinema."
2128,1,"Sugar embarks on a wonderful adventure, traveling the world, using his abilities for the benefit of others, not for himself. This is the kind of movie we need right now, in world where destructive selfishness and xenophobia are running rampant."
2129,1,...a wittily verbose master class on the way voice can be employed in fiction.
2130,1,The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is a fascinating experiment in narration and storytelling.
2131,1,The story-telling here is beautiful.
2132,1,The longest of [Anderson's Dahl shorts] collection is also by far its richest.
2133,1,"Wes Anderson's inventive, precisely calibrated cinematic contrivance works - making this enigmatic anthology enchanting viewing."
2134,1,"The result is exhilarating to watch, with Anderson's witty filmmaking sitting perfectly alongside Dahl's darkly provocative narratives."
2135,1,"It’s thrilling to be distracted by really good storytelling. But it’s more thrilling to be provoked, or even altered by it."
2136,1,I think this is the just the right bite-size amount of Wes Anderson... I kind of feel like shorts are an excellent use of his his style [and] his voice.
2137,1,Anderson seems to have perfected the art of simultaneously showing and telling – a tinkertoy approach to cinema that can pall over the length of a feature but plays with delightful brio in a short.
2138,1,A confounding mix of admirable skill and disconcerting ideas carries over from author Roald Dahl’s short stories into a series of mini films directed by Wes Anderson.
2139,1,As charming and heartfelt as any film Anderson has made.
2140,1,"Taken as a whole, and the four films should be watched together, it's a deeply significant work for Anderson, and one of the year's best movies, no matter how you parse it."
2141,0,"I promise not to review the rest of Wes Anderson’s Roald Dahl adaptations when they come out. I can see them already without the use of my eyes, just like Imdad Khan in The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar."
2142,1,"Once more, Wes made me cry with the beauty and sweetness of it all."
2143,1,"Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl. What a brilliant, eccentric, complicated relationship that is."
2144,1,"If Dahl's original work offered a peek into the writing process, Anderson's retelling does the same for the staging process."
2145,1,"It's yet another sign that Anderson is only getting weirder, and more wondrous, the further he plunges into middle age."
2146,1,"Watching Henry Sugar, perhaps more so than any other film I’ve seen, gives the sensation of being read a great picture-book -- albeit one that is fully alive, cinematic, and age-agnostic."
2147,1,"Dahl and Anderson are kindred spirits in whimsy, fully simpatico."
2148,1,"Roald Dahl’s work has always been a salve to children in need, acknowledging the cruelty of the wider world and celebrating inventive defiance. With these short films Wes Anderson shows how that still matters."
2149,1,There’s such a wonky harmony between Dahl’s words and Anderson’s profoundly unique style which makes this quirky short film such a delight.
2150,1,Anderson has said it was the story’s nesting-doll structure that drew him to Henry Sugar in the first place... and he realizes its concentric narratives with dazzling fluidity.
2151,1,"A short film with the weight and breadth of an epic, traversing continents and time periods while remaining stock still."
2152,1,"Those who eagerly await the newest American Empirical Picture will be entranced, as usual, by the toybox sets and the people standing stock still like toy figures inside immaculate compositions."
2153,1,"Lest viewers become even briefly comfortable with the enchantments of his staging and of his actors’ performances, Anderson jolts them alert with ever more audacious contrivances."
2154,1,"... With Wes Anderson's perspective, this story becomes a small visual epic. [Full review in Spanish]"
2155,1,"This is an archetypal Anderson film: mannered, fussy, obsessively designed – normally irksome traits, but in this alchemic instance it’s an utterly delightful combination."
2156,1,The reunion of Dahl’s writing and Anderson’s filmmaking for the first time since Fantastic Mr. Fox yields similarly wonderful results.
2157,1,Wes Anderson's most enjoyable work since The Grand Budapest Hotel
2158,1,The imaginative world of Anderson's cinematic universe can never replicated. His work evokes a poise and elegant feeling that is impossible to imitate.
2159,1,"A perfect mix of the different quirkiness of Roald Dahl and Wes Anderson, this is as relevant today as it ever was."
2160,0,"Anderson pulls this lever of speed, of artifice, so hard, he breaks it..."
2161,1,A great reminder of the power of short form film.
2162,1,"It’s not among Dahl’s greatest hits or Anderson’s grand meringue delights, but “Henry Sugar” amuses here and there and passes by quickly, unlike the interminable “Asteroid City” and sometimes strained earlier Anderson outings."
2163,1,"As a main course, The Wonderful Story Of Henry Sugar probably wouldn’t be very satisfying, but as a light and airy dessert, it really hits the spot."
2164,1,"It’s a story about greed and altruism, an homage to Satyajit Ray, and the closest Wes Anderson will probably ever come to directing a superhero hero movie."
2165,1,"It employs no fewer than four narrators across a span of more than six decades, all in service of a deftly multi-threaded yarn that has the elegance and concision of a well-executed magic trick."
2166,0,"Anderson takes 40 minutes to tell the story of a debonair trickster in his flamboyant style, but I'm sometimes struck by the feeling that there's not much substance behind Benedict Cumberbatch's stage. [Full review in Spanish]"
2167,1,Anderson enhances Dahl’s parable in endearing and meaningful ways.
2168,1,"The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is, by all reckoning, a magnificent adaptation of an outstanding story."
2169,1,"The movie whips past in a moment, a result of the combined pace of the dialogue and sets that shift and morph endlessly; it's like trying to keep up with a speeding hare on your hands and feet."
2170,1,"There’s no illusion of reality here, no detachment from the storyteller and the story. In every single moment of The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, we are reminded that this is a product of human imagination, brought into being by human hands."
2171,1,"You can barely call it a movie. You can, however, recognize it as one of Wes Anderson‘s best attempts at transforming both his and his literary idol’s idiosyncrasies into something like art -- and the most satisfying posthumous double act in ages."
2172,1,"The story is oddball charming and even has a nifty moral to it. And the presentational style is, well, beautiful."
2173,1,"Beautiful and poignant, this is such a brilliant way to bring these short stories to life."
2174,1,"Where blockbusters spend millions on digital de-ageing, Kingsley swaps wigs on-camera."
2175,1,"Rarely does it feel like there is a second wasted, and while this may be a short film, it is still dripping with rich detail that shows the prowess of Dahl as a storyteller and Anderson as a director, a match made in cinematic heaven"
2176,1,"Henry Sugar shows a filmmaker at the height of his powers, using his finely honed skills and keen self-awareness to perfectly capture Dahl’s whimsical spirit."
2177,1,"A choreographed dance of an experience — one that could have easily felt like a run-on sentence, but instead flies by."
2178,1,"Ultimately, the mix of marquee names, relatively bite-sized format and Netflix as a platform feels like an ideal marriage of talent, material and distribution -- a better combination, frankly, than Anderson's last few movies."
2179,1,"The story itself might be a short, but the initiative within this tale is anything but."
2180,1,"As a story, Roald Dahl’s The Wonderful Life of Henry Sugar might not be everyone’s cup of tea—it’s certainly not mine. But as a Wes Anderson short film, it is another delightful splendor with a fantastic cast bringing their whimsical A-game."
2181,1,"... With the charming The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, the director of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) returns to his best form. [Full review in Spanish]"
2182,1,Wes Anderson’s latest Roald Dahl adaptation The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar plays out like the most elaborately orchestrated and exquisitely executed episode of Jackanory every devised.
2183,1,"This short film doubles down on just about every peculiar element Anderson is known for and packs it into a relatively short runtime. The dialog is smartly written and exceptionally delivered, creating a measured beat that could be timed with a metronome."
2184,1,"Anderson’s decision-making is on point, as this story is told without much filler. Not one moment feels unnecessary. Every character serves a purpose, and the production design is outstanding."
2185,1,"A children’s tale and a trifle, but Anderson has found a way to deliver a sophisticated, self-assured, and endlessly charming adaptation that would make Imdad Khan proud — even if he was blindfolded in the back row."
2186,1,"As Anderson says, it's about the telling of the story as much as it is about the story itself."
2187,1,The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar crafts a truly unique experience that is well worth investing the 39 minutes it takes to watch.
2188,1,[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is] constantly witty and hilariously deadpan.
2189,1,"In Henry Sugar, Anderson creates a storybook set in motion—where the sets fly and the characters transform with the same playfulness as our parents switching voices during bedtime stories."
2190,1,"This film is intriguing, even exhilarating, in its way, and maybe no other director could have represented the material as well..."
2191,1,"Visually pleasing, entertaining, and a whole lot of fun. Making it a short rather than a feature was a brilliant decision because it helps with pacing and allows it to be interesting the whole way through."
2192,1,"Less (time, in this case) is more. And The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is the best out of the last three films by our dear Wes Anderson. [Full review in Spanish]"
2193,1,"A delightful first instalment in a planned quartet of short films, Anderson and Dahl’s sensibilities continuing to be a match made in heaven."
2194,1,The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar is filled with non-stop narration with layers of decadent dioramas that suit Wes Anderson’s quirks making it a warm welcome back to the director.
2195,1,"Like in Asteroid City, and in other Anderson films, it's the clear proof and pursuit of that creation that brings truth to spectacle. And what gorgeous truths and spectacles lie in wait in The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar."
2196,1,"A beautiful and bountiful bite-size film, it stands as Anderson’s second triumph of 2023 (following June’s Asteroid City) and a mini-masterwork in its own right."
2197,1,"This might not be as flat-out unmissable as Asteroid City, but it’s a charming addition to Anderson’s filmography that serves as a promising appetiser for the Dahl adaptations to come."
2198,1,Henry Sugar's The Wonderful Story tells the story of a man who managed to see without using his eyes. [Full review in Spanish]
2199,0,"Anderson grants his audience a sense of cosy complicity via fourth-wall-breaking asides, but there’s not much to get purchase on in a thinly-sketched morality tale."
2200,1,"It’s a short film, but its portrayal of inspiration, self-evident in both its artistry and homage, is simply enormous."
2201,1,"The result is delightful, but it also suggests a universe that requires our own imagination to be fully realized — which is, of course, the whole point of the story."
2202,1,"The book, of course, is one of the sweetest Dahls written (see Henry’s surname). And it’s now become a perfectly precise blast of finest Anderson."
2203,1,"In a work suffused with stupefying mysteries, the strange visions Henry Sugar teems with echo its drifters’ wide-eyed wonder as well as their creator’s. It’s an infectious feeling."
2204,1,"Form underscores content in ""Henry Sugar"" in a most delightful way."
2205,1,Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl is one of cinema’s most well-matched marriages and this one is a whimsically wonderful anthology.
2206,1,"[Richard] Ayoade is probably the strongest of the new entrants to Anderson’s ensemble, hiding seamlessly behind disguises in multiple roles and grasping the silent-era style of Anderson’s favored physical comedy."
2207,1,Having a limit on the runtime allows Anderson to challenge himself and focus on making the most charming and slender movie possible.
2208,1,"Against the odds, Anderson has turned out to be perhaps the greatest interpreter of Dahl we have."
2209,1,"For devotees, it's a delightful little morsel, lovingly brought to life as only Anderson knows how."
2210,1,"Whimsy with a capital W that unleashes Anderson’s arsenal of quirks. Truly marvellous medicine for fans, but could be a broken record for those who aren’t."
2211,1,"Wonderful by name, wonderful by nature. Wes Anderson's 39-minute adaptation of Roald Dahl's homonymous story is a truly gorgeous creation."
2212,1,Yet another vital chapter in the filmmaker’s career-long obsession with self-understanding in a senseless world.
2213,1,Small but perfectly crafted.
2214,1,"The result is funny and charming, a short but entirely satisfying confection."
2215,1,The “Fantastic Mr. Fox” author’s “The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar” seems to have found its ideal screen incarnation in the “Fantastic Mr. Fox” director’s hands...
2216,1,"If Asteroid City was writer-director Wes Anderson’s love letter to the stage, his new Netflix short pays homage to stagecraft, with flats, backdrops, props, and even hair and makeup changes flying in from the wings."
2217,1,"Bening, Foster and Ifans blend their talents to tell an interesting story."
2218,1,"It’s hard to deny a film that allows two 60+-year-old women to own the spotlight as effectively as they do while we watch them deal with every kind of ocean danger, from sharks to jellyfish."
2219,1,Annette Bening is fantastic as Diana Nyad...The core of the film is the friendship of these two women [Bening & Foster] and I loved the bond between the two characters and how they know each other's strengths and weakness.
2220,1,"Biopic on the world-class long-distance swimmer, Diana Nyad."
2221,1,"Oscar contender Annette Bening delivers a bravura performance as cranky competitor Diana Nyad as Jodie Foster captures not only the ambivalence but also the physicality of her former lover-now-trainer in this agonizing, inspirational, exhausting biopic."
2222,1,"Nevertheless, as a piece of old-fashioned, inspirational Hollywood entertainment, it works well enough, thanks largely to Bening and Foster, who elevate it to awards-worthy status in spite of itself."
2223,1,...a better-than-expected real-life tale that’s elevated by its first-class players.
2224,1,"It's solid, The performances are terrific and there's an interesting story which propels Nyad."
2225,1,"When Jodie Foster coaches her through the final leg, you can see her will passing to Annette Bening. It’s a stirring moment that makes her feat even more noteworthy."
2226,1,"Bening feels quite committed as an artist, letting the madness shine just a little in her eyes to evoke just how determined Nyad has become to touch her dream."
2227,1,"While the often spiky and single-minded Nyad is brilliantly brought to life by an acerbic Bening... it’s actually Foster’s turn as her best friend, coach and regularly exasperated confidante Bonnie Stoll that stays with you."
2228,1,"Though the movie conveniently swims past a couple of factual controversies, Nyad is stirring and inspirational, a rarity in film today."
2229,1,"Bening and Foster, the champs that they are, go the distance in a winning bio-drama."
2230,1,"This well-constructed production does not try and soften Nyad’s famously thorny personality, nor embellish the obvious adversities placed in her path."
2231,1,"This is a heart-rending diversion from your typical athlete biopic, directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (directors of 'Free Solo'). They seem eminently qualified to tell the story of Nyad, who was hardly your typical athlete."
2232,1,"This true chronicle lends itself to a sports movie’s narrative flow and swell of dramatic license, yet NYAD was made by a pair of Oscar-winning documentarians giving it a purposeful backbone of authenticity to push some of those tropes to the side."
2233,1,"Annette Bening is spectacular, as are Jodie Foster and Rhys Ifans, all working to capture the real-life harrowing adventure that was filled with frustration, danger, and ultimately success."
2234,1,"This isn’t a montage-crammed epic portrait, but a detailed picture that’s genuinely curious about the person at its center, and the good and bad traits that make up their mindset."
2235,0,"Largely due to the talents behind the camera, what could have been a layered and poignant true story becomes an overly simplified and generic feature that fails to have a true bite or leave a lasting impression."
2236,1,The script allows space to show how the protagonist's actions affect those who want to help her achieve her goal. It is in that space that Jodie Foster gives one of the most natural and elegant performances of her entire career. [Full review in Spanish]
2237,0,"We have a story of a person channeling all the doubt, hurt, and trauma to push them to climb the top of their mountain. Those themes hit harder if you give space to all sides of the subject – something Nyad goes in a touch-and-go manner."
2238,0,"Chin and Vasarhelyi's documentarian sensibilities are frequently at odds with this by-the-numbers inspirational sports drama, whose subject is so wholly unlikable that you might just find yourself rooting for her failure."
2239,1,"NYAD provides us with an energetic and crowd-pleasing biopic sports film that feels more honest than most, vaulting the story of the holistic individual over the incredible accomplishment."
2240,1,"Manages to overcome some genre flaws thanks to great performances by Bening and Foster, and the inspiring, impressive achievement at its center. [Full review in Spanish]"
2241,1,"Watch it for the two lead performances if nothing else, and maybe bring a towel."
2242,0,The film could have benefitted from a tighter runtime and more focus on Nyad’s past to create a more dynamic character for Bening.
2243,1,Strong performances by Annette Bening as long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad and Jodie Foster as her longtime friend and coach keep the Netflix biographical sports drama “Nyad” afloat.
2244,1,"[Nyad's] refusal to submit to hagiographic impulses gives the film a documentary-like edge of truth, making the rousing moments here feel genuinely earned."
2245,1,"The film, directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin is willing to let you judge Nyad yourself, according to your own litmus test of what's inspirational versus what's delusional."
2246,0,Good performances were not enough to alleviate my frustrations with the characters and their inequitable obsessions.
2247,1,Nyad is a classic case of a cast of true pros elevating an otherwise boilerplate picture.
2248,1,"Fortunately, the roles and the approach taken are lightyears beyond what's usually reserved for female actors over 60. [Full review in Spanish]"
2249,1,Stirring stuff.
2250,1,"Though it is unavoidably hobbled by the conventions of the sports film genre, Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi’s “Nyad” proves inspirational all the same."
2251,1,"A classic American sports movie, with all of its triumphs and clichés — kept afloat by two brilliant, warm lead performances from Annette Bening and Jodie Foster."
2252,0,"For all that Nyad is happy to show its subject’s personality flaws, it has trouble finding her humanity,"
2253,1,"Nyad builds to exuberant emotional crescendos that feel straight out of the schmaltzy Hollywood biopic playbook, but these scenes transcend cliché thanks to the emotionally resonant performances at their core."
2254,1,"A parable on the strength of the human spirit - uplifting, dramatic and you’ll ugly cry. Bening and Foster are, as always, in tip-top shape, and special kudos to Rhys Ifans for a strong and compassionate performance."
2255,0,"Jimmy Chin & Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi are exceptional documentarians well versed in the complexities of the everyday motivations & relationships in extreme sports. Why they pivoted to the boring biopic beats and armchair psychology of ""Nyad"" is baffling."
2256,1,What's unexpected is that the best scenes are on dry land.
2257,1,An inspirational story about what it takes to achieve a late-life dream.
2258,1,"It’s a genuinely fun affair, predictability notwithstanding. Take a deep breath, therefore, and dive in. The journey is worth it."
2259,1,"A ""by-the-numbers"" biography using the regular formula, elevated above others thanks to the spectacular work of its protagonists (Full review in Spanish)."
2260,1,"As a portrait of a friendship, one tested by decades of high times and lows, successes and failures, bad behavior and forgiveness, Nyad the movie is trawling deeper waters."
2261,1,"To my relief, the directors trace Diana’s mythic roots not just to the naiads, but to zealots like Captain Ahab."
2262,1,"“Nyad” is a different sort of sports film. Like the title subject, which helped to create the sport, this unique film builds something thought to be boring (hours of continuous swimming) into a thrilling viewing experience."
2263,1,"This is a classic story of personal overcoming, but this one gets everything right... [Full review in Spanish]"
2264,1,"If the script is fairly straightforward, with flashbacks to Nyad's childhood trauma along the way, the performances keep pushing it forward, especially Bening and Foster, two pros who make a hell of an on-screen pair."
2265,1,"A trimmed-down version of NYAD that saw itself as a sports drama first instead of biopic, with fewer flashbacks, fewer sidesteps to archival footage, and fewer animated sequences would have been exceptional."
2266,1,"When Nyad takes to the water, it’s a captivating underdog story about a woman who swam against the tide of prejudice and ageism to be the best."
2267,0,[H]ow much more effective might this story have been if the filmmakers simply embraced the real deal?
2268,1,"Like any great sports movie, it’s the people, not the game that is most compelling."
2269,0,"Directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin are primarily documentary filmmakers... But they struggle to adapt some of those skills to a scripted format, relying too heavily on archival footage, which gums up the film rather than deepens it."
2270,1,"Partnering with her best friend and coach, Bonnie (Jodie Foster), “Nyad” tells her story of determination, resiliency, and most importantly friendship and self-worth."
2271,1,The chance to watch Annette Bening and Jodie Foster spark off each other as veteran marathon swimmer Diana Nyad (Bening) and her best friend/coach Bonnie Stoll (Foster) is the chief pleasure of Nyad...
2272,1,"A fascinating portrait of a fiercely committed and determined ocean swimmer, and likely pain-in-the-butt, delivered with welcome worldliness and astringent humour by its two terrific female lead actors"
2273,1,"Too much of this movie relies on archival footage, and a somewhat rigid recounting of Nyad’s failed attempts — a level of detail that may appeal to the swimming purists, but cuts into the tension of her pursuit."
2274,1,Documentarian directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi (the married couple who did “Free Solo” and “The Rescue”) and TV screenwriter Julia Cox make a smooth transition to an epic feature debut with this adaption of Nyad’s autobiography
2275,1,NYAD is an inspiring film not just for its subject matter but for the performance of the two lead actors which is most memorable.
2276,1,"Nyad is the biopic of determination, with an excellent performance by Annette Bening, revealing a story about the sheer will and power of never giving up."
2277,1,"There’s an easiness between [Bening and Foster] on screen, and the kind of scene partners where you truly feel one elevating the other’s performance."
2278,1,This is a sturdy biopic that gives two great actresses an opportunity to shine – and look in the mirror and say “Find a Way.”
2279,1,"The sports drama...proves more exhausting than exhilarating, but in a way that’s the point....And the fact that the film boasts two impressive lead performances gives it the impetus it needs."
2280,1,"It's in the rewarding scenes between Bening and Foster, who is magnetic as Nyad's long-suffering friend and coach, that the film truly shines."
2281,1,They don't utterly transcend the the inspirational sports figure movie you've seen a million times but... they do find ways to make this different.
2282,0,"The biopic has its moments, certainly, and it’s stronger thanks to a marvelous cast, but it could have been better had it dived beyond the surface."
2283,1,"Society is still grappling with accepting tough women who don't feel the need to smile when they're in the trenches, and perhaps Nyad is a step in showing that accomplished women should be allowed to be imperfect, too."
2284,1,This heartfelt story is always watchable.
2285,1,"Without over-egging the story's inherent adventure elements too much, directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin let the events play out authentically, and the engaging characters make it both gripping and unmissable."
2286,1,"Fresh from various film festival victories and still ringing with applause, NYAD arrives at last on both streaming platforms and the commercial screen, as splendid and captivating as ever. It’s the winning tabulate of tenacity, friendship, grit and drive."
2287,1,"If Bening’s lead is the draw for Nyad, the true heart of the film belongs to Jodie Foster. The actress delivers her best performance since The Silence of the Lambs by letting audiences see through Bonnie what Nyad’s swim means to the world."
2288,1,"Bening imbues Nyad with subliminal vulnerability. Be it an unexpected flash of despair in her usually piercing eyes or a fleeting recognition of her own miserable ridiculousness, she draws us, almost against our will, to this singularly difficult woman."
2289,0,The big flaw is that the screenplay by TV writer Julia Cox is a flat and curiously uninvolving piece of writing.
2290,1,The wry humour provided by the long-suffering Bonnie; the lovely lived-in quality of the friendship... gives the film its crowd-pleasing appeal.
2291,1,"After 52 hours, 200,000 strokes, five attempts and 35 years, Diana Nyad showed the world a life well lived like a diamond which is just a lump of coal that stuck with it, illustrating that women are more than just the sum of their parts."
2292,1,"The performances keep this biopic afloat, and the swimming sequences are staged with a vivid authenticity."
2293,1,"Benning plays her excellently, but is upstaged at times by the brilliant Foster, who really should act more often."
2294,1,"Bolstered by the splashy performances of Bening and co-star Jodie Foster, “Nyad” is the kind of crowd-pleasing true story that will make audiences stand up and cheer."
2295,1,"This is Bening’s Rocky, a performance that draws on every muscle and finds her often puffy-eyed, sunburned and sea-creature-stung. Definitely a 60-is-the-new-30 movie."
2296,1,"Nyad is an engaging, informative and innovative crowd-pleaser with-stand out performances from Bening and Foster."
2297,1,"Nyad might contain the requisite speeches and musical swells that are the bread and butter of sporting movies, but it also never fears adding layers of toughness and grit that make everything feel a lot more authentic."
2298,1,"What elevates “Nyad” above the expected terrain are the performances from Annette Bening and Jodie Foster, both individually and with each other."
2299,1,The friendship between Diana and Bonnie (Bening and Foster) is the beating heart of this wonderful film.
2300,1,"When Bening and Foster are onscreen together, it’s movie magic. They don’t just have chemistry; they’re chemistry professors."
2301,1,It's frustrating that a movie about a woman who dares so much has a script that dares so little. But Annette Bening’s body-and-soul acting as marathon swimmer Diana Nyad and Jodie Foster’s brilliance as her dynamo of a coach will have you cheering.
2302,1,"All human achievement might be directed through a specific person – like a movie director, for example – but it takes a crew behind the scenes to make that achievement possible; and it’s fascinating to see how that knowledge makes itself felt."
2303,1,"This is a movie with a clear goal. It aims to be inspirational, a crowd pleaser. And, for the most part, it succeeds."
2304,1,"Nyad is a story so spectacularly unbelievable that were it not true, I would most likely be chiding the filmmakers for being irresponsible."
2305,1,"“Where’s the excellence?” is Diana’s catch-cry. In this case, it’s mainly in the acting. Over-achievers in their own field, Bening and Foster are close to the whole show, with Rhys Ifans supplying back-up as a grizzled navigator."
2306,1,"Though the film is principally a showcase for Bening, it’s Foster’s supporting turn that lifts “Nyad.” Foster is a rare screen presence these days, which only makes her warmth and ease all the more powerful here."
2307,1,"[Bening] takes just seriously enough a heroine who takes herself very seriously indeed — a woman not borne back ceaselessly into her past, but front-crawling into the future."
2308,1,"Bening and Foster are absolute delights from beginning to end, giving Diana and Bonnie’s friendship... real emotional weight that the film’s script or direction simply do not otherwise provide."
2309,1,"It ranks high on the list of best sports-focused films, but it goes beyond that genre by being one of the very few films that’s anchored around two women who are queer and in their 50s to 60s and how they go about achieving a remarkable feat."
2310,1,"The filmmakers put the audience in the middle of their heroine’s punishing training regimen... and flashbacks to past traumas that explain not only Nyad’s often off-putting monomania, but her determination to succeed despite nearly impossible odds."
2311,1,You really feel that Bening is making that journey. You might start to feel that you’re swimming with her. But the movie’s technical excellence is overshadowed by its human dimension.
2312,1,The premise may be simple and the outcome all but predictable (especially if you saw any news of Nyad back in September 2013) but that makes its story no less compelling.
2313,0,"As the film wears on, Diana’s personal motivations are increasingly blurred, and to the point that she comes to be defined almost exclusively by the adversity over which she triumphs."
2314,1,"There’s a lot to support “Nyad” through some choppy storytelling waters, giving the picture a special screen power."
2315,0,"Isn't Hollywood supposed make real people seem more interesting and outrageous, not less?"
2316,0,There’s zero overt mention of the controversy surrounding her signature triumph—thereby proving that the film cares more about rah-rah uplift than thorny inquiry or messy reality.
2317,0,Profound is definitely not a word that can be associated with A Walk in the Woods.
2318,1,Won't ever be mentioned in the same breath as any of Redford or Nolte's classic films - it's too silly and too obvious - but watching these two charismatic actors onscreen it's not hard to remember what we liked about them in the first place.
2319,1,"(Redford and Nolte) make tired clichés feel like old friends, taking us on a pleasant stroll through the woods that may not lead anywhere, but we're having such a good time that the destination no longer matters."
2320,1,"As an adaptation of Bill Bryson's writing A Walk in the Woods is disappointing, but there's still pleasure to be had in seeing two veteran actors taking a hike together."
2321,1,"As beautiful, witty and serene as this story of self-discovery is, and as effortlessly as the veteran stars pull it off, I can't help but hope that Redford will take on a project with a bit more meat on the bone."
2322,0,"Redford, Nolte, and co. want us to leave with a profound sense of self and inspiration, they leave us instead with a fairly fun buddy-comedy in the woods. Still, it's worth the walk."
2323,0,American Pie for nursing homes.
2324,0,"They wander across the screen, and we gain no insight into their characters. The dialogue isn't funny or moving. Nothing is ventured, and nothing is gained."
2325,1,"Worth sticking with for that, and to see Redford and Nolte spark off each other like the old pros they are."
2326,1,"""A Walk in the Woods"" makes you laugh and inspires you to reconnect with people and nature. It's truly a feel-good film."
2327,1,"Tents collapse, bunkbeds give way and streams are there only for men-old-enough-to-know-better to fall into. Subtle it is not."
2328,0,It's enough to make those Grumpy Old Men movies seem like masterworks of grace and subtlety.
2329,0,"[Walk in the Woods] is like watching your grandpa explore America, but when he starts to lecture, you realize it's time to leave the old man behind for the bears."
2330,1,"A Walk in the Woods isn't a spectacular film. It's just a good, simple, solid one. Pleasurable in the most unassuming way."
2331,1,"[It's] more about the ebbs and flows of friendship than it is about the walk. And when the friends in question are a brace of ageing Hollywood heavyweights brimming with charisma, its no hardship to share time in their company."
2332,1,"If you're in the mood for guys who resemble old furniture or aged whisky, bickering incessantly as they trek through miles of forest, A Walk in the Woods is just the thing."
2333,1,"Darned if the film didn't ultimately work for me. Mostly, it was the fun of seeing these two veteran actors riff off each other."
2334,0,"Inoffensive, unremarkable and mostly just a bit naff, this adaptation of Bill Bryson's memoir of walking the Appalachian Trail is about as good as it could possibly have hoped to be, which is to say not very good at all."
2335,0,"A sitcom about old men creaking along the Appalachian Trail, reminiscing about slutty girls, and maybe having a stroke at any moment. You know, for fun."
2336,1,"A Walk in the Woods is a big-hearted, endlessly funny and just plain likable survivalist-buddy-road-trip-comedy-drama that also has something to say."
2337,0,"Bear jokes, poop jokes, bear poop jokes -- this movie's got 'em all!"
2338,0,"Here, Bryson's a wizened cipher, wrapped in a grizzled grump, inside a pickled jerk. Patter gets pat, wise old-guy talk vies with lame wisecracks, and slapstick turns slapschtick. This slog's a waste of time and space."
2339,1,"The film contains many incidents, constant drops of humor and some tear-jerker. [Full review in Spanish]"
2340,1,"The premise of bickering old friends forced together while out of their comfort zones has been done before and far better (Whitnail and I, City Slickers), but the two leads' star power and easy charm makes this an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours."
2341,1,A fun and simple comedy that works due to Robert Redford's and Nick Nolte's charisma. [Full review in Spanish]
2342,1,"An enjoyable comedy for mature audiences, with some really hillarious moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
2343,0,A little more pace and purpose might have prevented this being so pedestrian
2344,1,"Man, I'm such a sucker for movies about grumpy old men taking trips."
2345,0,"Unfortunately, its shenanigans end up being tiresome instead of charming. [Full Review in Spanish]"
2346,0,Most of the jokes revolve around the age of the characters and an over dependence on slapstick humor make this a rocky and slippery hike of a movie. [Full review in Spanish]
2347,1,Redford and Notle are a great comedic couple because of their respective on screen personas. [Full review in Spanish]
2348,1,"Echoing his witty writing style, Bill Bryson's memoir of his trek up the Appalachian Trail is adapted as a gently amusing comedy that combines big landscapes with sharp observational humour."
2349,0,"While you might find yourself musing how much more interesting it might have been to watch Emma Thompson walking in the woods for a couple of hours, you might also be distracted by the film's presentation of the Appalachian Trail per se."
2350,0,"It hits its stride now and then, and mostly because of Nick Nolte."
2351,1,"In the lightest movie ever made by either one, Nolte and Redford barely pull this one out of Lake Woebegone territory."
2352,1,"Nolte finds real sympathy for Katz and delivers a compellingly watchable performance, even if you're slightly afraid he'll keel over at any moment."
2353,1,"It's not heavy; it's not wildly significant. But A Walk in the Woods has a redemptive tone, a gentle lesson about aging and limitations and never giving up despite any required climb, uphill or otherwise."
2354,0,"Robert Redford and Nick Nolte are fine actors, yet even they cannot save this one note story of a long journey to nowhere."
2355,0,"Plunders laugh-out-loud scenes from the book - getting kitted out with ludicrously expensive gear, becoming obsessed with bear attacks - and turns them into deadening Grumpy Old Men/Victor Meldrew-ish moments of bewildered outrage."
2356,0,"An uninspired mixture of slapstick comedy and sentimentality, A Walk In The Woods gets by on the charisma of the two stars but there are times when it feels stretched to breaking point."
2357,1,Misadventure and musing about the meaning of life and growing old ensues.
2358,0,"There are a few chuckles along the way, but only the scenery has any real depth."
2359,0,Upping the age of the characters has turned a bad idea into a terrible one.
2360,0,Unrelentingly inept.
2361,1,A Walk in the Woods is unabashedly sentimental and sometimes as slow-moving as its two curmudgeonly leads but it has an undeniable and redemptive charm.
2362,0,This is a schlep.
2363,1,"Like the book upon which it's based, Robert Redford's latest is a film of small but continual pleasures - an amiable amble that's almost impossible to dislike."
2364,0,"Nolte is terrific insofar as he is allowed to be, but what ensues is, cinematically, a mess."
2365,1,"Chugging along like Planes, Trains And Automobiles with a drop in comic horsepower, it's an unremarkable but perfectly serviceable odd-couple caper that'll pass the time when it's a bit grim outside."
2366,1,"Despite plodding interchanges and lack of cinematic bravura for some of America's most spectacular scenery, Redford and Nolte are genuinely hilarious together."
2367,0,Run for the hills.
2368,1,"This slight, lightly charming comic adventure is most obviously appealing for the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" set -- though Bryson himself was in his forties when he made his journey."
2369,0,Redford's performance is really so stilted it's as if he is playing Bill Bryson the way a famous writer with no performing skills might play himself.
2370,0,Kwapis's film is so un-Brysonishly leaden-footed that Redford and Nolte might as well have walked the trail in diving boots.
2371,0,A Walk in the Woods is as aimless as its title.
2372,1,"Redford takes on the role of Bryson, while Nick Nolte is his travel companion Katz, and the two veterans share an engaging chemistry that quite often makes up for the film's many shortcomings."
2373,1,A pleasant-enough account of two shambling old geezers taking on the grandeur of nature.
2374,0,A Walk in the Woods is a trifle compared to 2014's Wild... But darned if Redford's easy charm and Nolte's gravelly lack of it aren't enticing throughout. Even when drastically lowering their standards they're stars.
2375,0,"[W]ith a richer comic vision of two weathered American males testing themselves against the primordial forest, the movie...might have made it to the finish line."
2376,0,"There's very little about hiking in this movie, but you do get to see Nick Nolte stuffing pancakes into his stupid face."
2377,0,"t's not so much that the movie is actively bad -- well, the largely dismissive attitude toward women is pretty bad -- as that it's almost aggressively mediocre."
2378,0,Crudely written in a pedestrian way.
2379,0,"Redford and Nolte make for a Pleasant ""Walk."""
2380,1,"Instead of sharp comedy and insight into these men, we get broader situational and physical comedy skits. Despite that, enough of the comedy works. Redford and Nolte work so well together that it is worth joining these two guys on this trip."
2381,0,"A moldy, unairable, two-hour sitcom pilot that I would downgrade cable plans to avoid."
2382,1,"While this long-in-development comedic/dramatic charmer as directed by Ken Kwapis has a few tricky issues in the altered and updated details, there's also no doubt that it's most enjoyable, and definitely more fun than a dose of poison ivy."
2383,0,"While this film keeps the bare outlines of Bryson's story, it both misunderstands his comic voice and conveys it wrongly."
2384,1,"Unlike most offerings on the multiplex menu, you can watch this one with your 80-year-old uncle and your 15-year-old daughter. Everyone will have a reasonably good time without muddying their boots."
2385,0,"is not entirely without its charms, but is so scattered both tonally and narratively that nothing ever quite adds up"
2386,0,"Redford and Nolte plod through the woods because the ""Sundance Kid"" and the ""Prince of Tides"" have gotten older."
2387,0,"This one is strictly a walk, don't run proposition."
2388,0,"A Walk in the Woods is decent light entertainment; there's just no real meat to it. Without a strong thematic center, the movie can feel a bit repetitive at times - Grumpy Old Men in the wild, so to speak."
2389,1,"Sensitive and scenic, it's an amiable amble with two crusty curmudgeons..."
2390,0,"In one of the most generous pieces of movie casting ever, travel writer Bill Bryson is portrayed by Robert Redford in this lazy, feather-light adaptation of his book about walking the Appalachian Trail."
2391,0,"For as profound an experience as it portrays, A Walk in the Woods in retrospect feels as slight as its title."
2392,0,"Decides to go for - nay, strain for - antics. You can hear the brainstorming: What can we have happen to them?"
2393,0,"A Walk in the Woods is pleasant but inconsequential, a passing diversion rather than a worthy cinematic destination."
2394,1,There's almost nothing here beyond the opportunity to watch two veteran actors play off one another -- and it turns out that's enough.
2395,0,"Amiable, if shallow, entertainment, until it falls off a cliff."
2396,1,"While this movie could have been an overly earnest drama or an embarrassing slapstick farce, it settles somewhere comfortably in between."
2397,1,Some will find parts of this offensive. Grow a sense of humor. I recommend hiking to a local theater and catching this really funny old guy buddy flick.
2398,1,"In the end, 'A Walk in the Woods' isn't much more than a lark; but it has just enough meat on its bones to make it a lark worth your while."
2399,0,"Quaint, breezy and inoffensive... as well as entirely forgettable."
2400,0,"A Walk In The Woods is much more about tame silliness, which leaves us with a dull and lifeless film."
2401,1,"While older audiences will go for it, even viewers who haven't acquired the wisdom of age can learn something."
2402,0,"The laughs are few, and the homespun philosophy about as deep as a fortune cookie."
2403,0,"Too much of the breezy humor that made the book a delight is stripped away, replaced with predictable jokes and broad slapstick, sitcom-quality encounters with women and bears and a pushy, grating sentimentality."
2404,0,"A waste of stars, scenery, and setup."
2405,0,"The lax, lame A Walk in the Woods is a road movie without a road, a journey of self-discovery without discovery, and a tale of friendship without any chemistry."
2406,0,[The film] is for anyone who wants to see two of America's finest screen actors completely humiliate themselves.
2407,1,I enjoyed the film to the degree that comfort food extends to frozen pizza: It's warm; it's cheesy; it's not as fresh as I had hoped for.
2408,1,Watching these two interact and listening to their wizened characters' riffs amid gorgeous scenery is a sheer delight -- which is a good thing since that comprises the bulk of the movie.
2409,1,"[Nolte] and Redford make an agreeable comedy team, and they're framed against some spectacular scenery along the trail that Kwapis and his second unit almost can't help but find."
2410,1,"A Walk in the Woods is at its best when Redford and Nolte let the laughs subside, and just relax as two guys contemplating their lives, mortality and the joys of one last adventure together."
2411,1,A delightful chance to savor the acting skills of veteran film stars Robert Redford and Nick Nolte.
2412,1,"Surprisingly impish, keeping encouraging distance from maudlin activities to transform into an R-rated romp through the wilderness, subverting expectations for a somber reflection on the fragility of life."
2413,1,"The star power of Redford and Nolte will attract older audiences, though I'm not so sure for the under 40 crowd."
2414,1,The real pleasures are not to be found in the sweeping shots of the Great Smoky Mountains but in seeing how Mr. Redford and Mr. Nolte's characters learn to get along.
2415,1,"Depending on your age, disposition, and expectations about movies, A Walk in the Woods is either a soft entertainment or a refreshing meditation on man's relationship with nature, both without and within."
2416,0,"Though it is pleasant enough simply to be in the company of these two charismatic old stagers, Redford and Nolte are never the hilarious double-act director Ken Kwapis makes them out to be."
2417,0,"Come for the simulated bumping and grinding, stay for the ridiculous drama, stilted acting, hilarious soundtrack, and laughably offensive ideas about male and female desire."
2418,0,This repugnant Fifty Shades knockoff plays like an erotic rewrite of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
2419,0,"The Room meets Beauty and the Beast, 50 Shades of Grey and the stockholm syndrome in this cheesy erotic thriller with not a single positive aspect about it. Why such a product is Netflix's top movie of 2020 baffles almost everyone."

2497,0,"Poorly directed but passionately performed, Netflix's biopic of the overlooked Civil Rights activist Bayard Rustin lets star Colman Domingo down with subpar storytelling."
2498,1,Colman Domingo gives one of the year's very best performances.
2499,0,"Domingo’s energetic, commanding performance holds the center of the film, but he’s ill-served by the formulaic approach to storytelling that unfolds around him."
2500,1,"Wolfe’s beautiful film works two-fold, as a portrait of a man whose name you’ve likely never heard, and as a captivating chronicle of one of the most politically meaningful events in American history."
2501,1,"As written, “Rustin” does a pretty good job of making the (re-)introductions. As acted, the movie transcends pretty-good."
2502,1,What brings this film outrageously to life is the combination of a smart script and a blazing performance by Colman Domingo.
2503,1,Domingo delivers one of the year’s best performances as a man who fought public and private battles on multiple fronts.
2504,0,Rustin lacks the boldness of the man it seeks to portray. Rustin’s character is flattened and constrained by the genre.
2505,1,Colman Domingo gives a career defining performance as Bayard Rustin in this biopic about an unsung hero in history.
2506,1,"It's occasionally more interested in generating applause-worthy soundbites than anything else, but Domingo proves once again capable of making anything he touches shine."
2507,1,"Rustin is solid, slightly stagey film-making that is elevated by a thrillingly dynamic central performance from the versatile Colman Domingo."
2508,1,"Rustin persevered enough to succeed in ways that put many of us to shame. There is no doubt that he had a dream, too, and this film by director George C. Wolfe works hard to show how his subject brought it to fruition."
2509,1,"It matters not only for its hero, but for how his story is told -- by and for those who shared his struggles and still feel their impact the most today."
2510,1,"Rustin finally works better as history than it does as drama. While its namesake might have assisted King’s rise to the mountaintop, in cinematic terms, the movie occupies a tier somewhere below it."
2511,1,"If the film’s goal is to raise the profile of Rustin – over being a tight, suspenseful drama – consider that met. Without the spot-on casting of Domingo, though, it might not be so memorable..."
2512,0,"All in all, one walks away from Rustin enchanted with Domingo’s performance, while feeling that a character as larger than life and momentous as Bayard Rustin surely deserves a film less dutiful and more inspired."
2513,1,"Rustin, for all of its flaws, is worth watching in every way because of the beauty of witnessing Coleman Domingo act."
2514,1,... explores with even-handed conviction the complicated legacy of a man often relegated to a behind-the-scenes figure who never was granted the recognition and appreciation he deserved.
2515,1,Colman Domingo is just a force of nature in this movie.
2516,1,"It's directed by George C. Wolfe, who most recently did Ma Rainey's Black Bottom. He's great with actors, and... great with period detail. I think both of those things are terrific in this movie."
2517,1,"With “Rustin,” Wolfe opens up his camera in a conventional manner that works but not nearly as well as his previous effort."
2518,1,"Mr. Domingo is a force of nature in this film, delivering a complex, highly sympathetic portrayal, but he also determines what the movie actually is, while preventing it from going awry."
2519,1,"A riveting performance from Colman Domingo and an important untold story propel the Netflix biopic, “Rustin.”"
2520,1,"As Rustin, Colman Domingo delivers the performance of his career. Known for flashy supporting roles in Euphoria and Fear the Walking Dead, Domingo captures the effervescence of Rustin without leaning on mannerisms or mimicry."
2521,1,"Rustin is another effective, entertaining example of what happens when you bring the right people in to tell a true story -- their story -- the right way."
2522,1,There’s such a sheen of biopic respectability coating Rustin—Netflix’s new award-season entrant—that you almost miss how radical it is.
2523,1,"Colman Domingo gives a award winning performance. His incredible talent radiates in every scene, as we explore this story about perseverance and self worth. George C. Wolfe direction is both upbeat and inspirational."
2524,1,"Every so often an actor so dominates a movie that its success largely hinges on his every word and gesture. That’s the case with Coleman Domingo’s galvanic title performance in “Rustin""..."
2525,0,"I loved the subject matter but was left disappointed with the storytelling. Instead of watching this one, just pick up a history book."
2526,1,"You leave the film knowing that you’ve met a hero, but that this remarkable man deserved more."
2527,1,"By times, Rustin feels rushed with an odd rhythm. But, the final moments as the March on Washington comes to life, are moving, empowering and pack an emotional punch, as does the portrait of a behind the scenes trailblazer and hero."
2528,1,"None other than Colman Domingo, one of the most versatile working actors, can capture Bayard Rustin’s persona."
2529,1,"Flaws and all, it draws us in, and we emerge entertained, satisfied and deeply moved."
2530,1,"Rustin is one of the most important and illuminating movies of the year, shining a spotlight on little-known leader of the Civil Rights Movement, Bayard Rustin. Colman Domingo gives an Oscar-worthy performance."
2531,1,If Rustin only gives you a slice of a story -- you could make seven different films out of his life and achievements -- it assures you walk away knowing who Bayard Rustin was. The same can be said for Colman Domingo. Attention must be paid a hundredfold.
2532,1,There’s a brightness to Rustin that doesn’t veer away from the consequences at the intersections of Bayard Rustin’s life. It allows the story to breathe like jazz.
2533,1,It is a film that flies by and leaves you knowing more than you knew going in and wanting to learn more after.
2534,1,This was an incredibly powerful film. Colman nailed Rustin down to the smallest detail. Phenomenal performance in a very powerful and tasteful film.
2535,1,"There's a few editing choices and the Lenny Kravitz song that I didn't quite connect with, but this movie is a phenomenal showcase for the fantastic Colman Domingo! His towering performance deserves to be in every awards conversation!"
2536,1,"Magnificent. Director George Wolfe hits another one out of the park on the heels of his perfect ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."" Coleman Domingo gives a tour de force performance. This is Coleman Domingo's moment!"
2537,1,"But Domingo has never had the opportunity to anchor a film like he does here, and it’s a bravura performance, full of fire, heart, doubt and fear playing a man who believed in the best pf humanity and beat to a different drummer."
2538,0,"It's a terrible, scattered, unpleasant movie in nearly every way except one: Colman Domingo's committed, energetic, downright thrilling work as the movie's subject, which elevates it to the point of ""sort of watchable."""
2539,1,"Because Rustin’s words are inherently awe-inspiring, and the dapper Domingo delivers them with consistent excellence, the movie moves up more notches than it might otherwise."
2540,1,"This film can serve as inspiration to work daily toward shaking off the humility that prevents us from being our full selves. If not for us, then for the sake of generations after."
2541,1,Colman Domingo owns this movie: triumphant performance.
2542,1,"As straight-down-the-middle biopics go, Rustin stands out just enough thanks to some genuinely compelling material and a truly special central performance."
2543,1,"Rustin is still one of the most engaging and unflinchingly heartfelt films we’ve seen this year, a perfectly apt tribute to a towering figure who is only now receiving due credit for his impact on the fight for equality."
2544,1,"That's a lot of territory and Rustin, a semi-successful bio-pic built around a strong performance by Colman Domingo, covers some of it, even as the richness and sweep of Rustin's life plays second fiddle to the March on Washington."
2545,1,"Jeffrey Wright as Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. in “Rustin” might be the year’s best bad guy in a movie."
2546,1,Rustin is a long overdue biopic with a shining performance from Colmon Domingo.
2547,1,"The draw for “Rustin,” aside from the depiction of an incredible moment in American history, is the showcase performance by Colman Domingo."
2548,1,"Wolfe hasn't reinvented the biopic wheel with this film, but he and the writers don't shy away from showing that the civil rights movement was inhabited by humans."
2549,1,"The visual flair and convincing period detail is matched by Domingo's towering portrayal, with every line of dialogue delivered like a call to arms."
2550,1,"Colman Domingo is an absolute knockout giving voice and fiery passion to Bayard Rustin. Domingo has been on Broadway, won an Emmy for Euphoria, and should be part of the Best Actor Oscar conversation."
2551,0,"Rustin, however, is a cinematic conception that feels stagey in the wrong ways. The dialogue is stiltedly explicative, with characters practically introduced by their verbal resumes."
2552,1,[Coleman Domingo's] performance adds life to the movie’s informative but prosaic history lesson.
2553,1,"[George C. Wolfe] can’t escape biopic cliches, as real life’s inevitable progress dulls imagination. His and Domingo’s love for their subject anyway powers a sufficiently complex character study, and resurrects an exemplary American hero."
2554,1,Rustin is a bold and generous movie that sets its conventional biopic wrapper on fire.
2555,0,"Exploring the mechanics of this epochal event is a great idea, led by a memorable performance from Domingo, that somehow still manages to render the protest march as flat and lifeless as any obligatory TV-movie checklist."
2556,1,"A smart, compact script (the movie runs just 106 minutes) coupled with Colman’s empathetic-yet-wily performance and the steady hand of director George C. Wolfe ensure that “Rustin” largely avoids biopic cliches."
2557,0,"In its attempt to show the “warts and all” political details within the Civil Rights movement, it ultimately becomes the kind of hagiography it wants to avoid."
2558,1,"Domingo creates a Rustin larger than life, but intimate enough to leave a lasting impression. Still, he remains almost as enigmatic as when the picture began. But at least we now know the name. It’s Rustin, and I’ll wager you won’t soon forget it."
2559,1,Colman Domingo gives an excellent performance as Rustin and the supporting cast is strong
2560,1,While the movie itself can be problematic...Colman Domingo’s transformational performance is so inspiring it is difficult not to get swept up in it.
2561,0,"It’s Domingo who carries every moment with his energetic, inspiring performance, which will surely find Netflix campaigning for him during awards season. Nevertheless, the by-the-numbers screenplay and filmmaking fail the actor."
2562,1,"The film’s a lively, shallow history lesson – you come out knowing a lot about the March on Washington but still wanting to know more about Rustin."
2563,1,"A stirring portrait of an oft-unsung civil rights hero and queer trailblazer, 'Rustin' doesn't deliver on all of its promise."
2564,1,Sad times when a film this square feels radical.
2565,1,"It’s a powerful story that succeeds despite some of the movie’s flawed narrative choices; from its misshapen structure, where a certain randomness seems to dictate what to leave in and out, to a tendency to lay it on thick."
2566,1,"Domingo captures every side of the man, from his swagger to his boyishness, his cajoling side to his hectoring will. It’s truly one of the best performances this year."
2567,1,This well-meaning and well-acted film shines a necessary spotlight on those behind the scenes of a movement.
2568,1,"The script, co-written by Dustin Lance Black, who won an Oscar for Milk, is sometimes plodding and formulaic but allows Domingo enough showpiece scenes of struggle and perseverance to make the hard-won finale truly tear-jerking."
2569,1,A routine biopic blessed with an electrifying star...valuable and historical...
2570,1,"Scripted by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black, the film is most compelling in these intimate moments, highlighting Rustin’s tenderness and resilience."
2571,0,"“Rustin” was undoubtedly made in admiration of its subject. Yet, with a stale approach to its plotline and confused narrative priorities, the film is more like an educational outline than a spirited story."
2572,1,"Fortunately, it has a ... stirring, exuberant lead performance by Colman Domingo."
2573,1,Rustin's fierce intellectualism and personal eccentricities are captured vibrantly by Domingo. It's the kind of performance that screams out for awards season.
2574,1,"Director George C. Wolfe had a dream to put unsung civil-rights firebrand Bayard Rustin front and center in a movie and now, with the help of producers Barack and Michelle Obama and a thrilling acting tour de force from the great Colman Domingo, he has."
2575,1,"You want to change the world? Gather some like-minded souls, roll up your sleeves and dream. It might, this optimistic film posits, come true."
2576,1,"Enough cannot be said about Domingo, a recognizable character actor in shows like “Euphoria” who has finally been given his moment to shine in the lead."
2577,0,"It's admirable the filmmakers want to bring Rustin into the spotlight, but as portrayed here, his life is still defined by the people and events surrounding him."
2578,1,Colman Domingo delivers one of the best performances of 2023
2579,0,"Rustin’s victories were harder won, and his losses more bitter and more numerous, than Rustin is willing to acknowledge. Hope is vital, but for hope to feel real, we need to acknowledge a Rustin who was more acquainted with despair."
2580,1,"Bayard Rustin may not have spoken at the March on Washington, but this film teaches us that he was as responsible as anyone for cementing its place in the history books."
2581,1,"Bayard Rustin deserves to be remembered for the entirety of his being, both as an activist and as an openly gay Black man in a time when it was criminal. As much as 'Rustin' attempts to balance both, it carries the former better than the latter."
2582,1,The breakout lead performance by Colman Domingo as the 60s civil rights organizer Bayard Rustin makes this modestly budgeted biographical drama pop like a Broadway musical.
2583,1,"A poignant and effective look at a point where the fight for equal racial and sexual rights uneasily intersected, Rustin follows a basic biopic template, but applies it to a story that hasn’t been told to death countless times before."
2584,1,"Director George C. Wolfe, a theater legend, keeps this biopic intriguing, making it almost feel like a caper."
2585,1,"If ever there was anyone born to play someone, it’s Domingo as the dynamic Bayard Rustin."
2586,0,"With a perfunctory plot that sometimes feels as montage-y and as superficial as the film’s opening reenactments, “Rustin” ultimately lands at the nexus of didacticism, melodrama and hagiography, when it should be stirring, unsentimental and stark."
2587,1,"A largely forgotten civil rights organizer gets his due in this solid drama starring Colman Domingo as the man who dreamed up the event where MLK gave his iconic ""I have a dream"" speech."
2588,1,"That’s much thanks to a soaring performance by Colman Domingo. A character actor known for decades of memorable performances, Domingo takes the lead in Rustin and owns the film from frame one."
2589,0,"Basic, broad, and severely missing tension, suspense, emotional depth, hell, anything that would render this experience effective beyond the flashy performance Colman Domingo is allowed to give"
2590,1,Colman Domingo’s performance in “Rustin” captures the exhilaration of a man in the happiest period of his life.
2591,0,It's the script that has (Domingo) constantly speaking in mini-monologues and stagy soliloquies. More organic conversations are often replaced by moments that seem aimed at Oscar voters. It's a nagging issue that's hard to overlook.
2592,1,"Hails this little-known racism fighter who worked from the sidelines to harness the power of peace to make walls fall, move mountains and work toward equality for all."
2593,1,Domingo’s performance defies stereotypes about the period.
2594,0,"A fantastic performance by Colman Domingo, but the whole thing is rather chintzy, with a poorly staged version of the March on Washington."
2595,1,"Colman Domingo is charismatic and dynamic enough to transcend the limitations of a script that too often passes by as a stream of sharp, quotable quotes and monologues."
2596,1,Colman Domingo is nothing short of sensational. A theatrical rendering of a man that in many ways was larger than life living in a world that sought to dull his shine — both from those against him and on his side.
2597,1,"The documentary becomes a piece of history and an archive in itself, its illustrative functions –  a crucial storytelling tool for posteriority."
2598,1,Porter’s film lets Lady Bird’s recorded voice be the personal testimony to cataclysmic events. She uncovered plenty of new archival footage that she pairs with the audio.

2671,1,Pivotal history delivered with a keen eye and a honeyed drawl.
2672,1,... the second film in the young adult dystopian series... improves upon the original 'The Hunger Games' in almost every way.
2673,1,"It not only adds to the groundwork laid by its predecessor, but it improves on it in nearly every area."
2674,1,"A powerful indictment of entertainment as propaganda, the film considers political, social, and emotional factors that transcend the limitations of a young adult novel and will, like its hero, hopefully, go on to represent something much more significant."
2675,1,Make no mistake that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the best of the sequels and maybe even the best film of the franchise.
2676,1,"In a decade full of hundred-million-dollar stinkers, CATCHING FIRE isn't just the peak of its franchise, but a compelling work in its own right."
2677,1,"It's grim, shot in hues of grey with a perpetually overcast sky, which lends it a classic feel, more like 1970s sci fi than the brightly couloured eye catchers Hollywood makes these days."
2678,1,"It's mainstream entertainment, but it succeeds at being riveting and deeply unsettling mainstream entertainment that casts a critical light on our current systems."
2679,1,"While the primary stars remain youthful, this film has matured substantially over its predecessor."
2680,1,An entertaining and thought-provoking film that proves we have a right to expect much more from even a good old-fashioned Hollywood popcorn flick.
2681,1,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is epic, filled with fantastic performances, great visual effects and a story that surpasses the first film in EVERY department."
2682,1,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire digs much deeper than the first installment and the result is a much stronger movie.
2683,1,'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' lights the fuse of this franchise in a more provocative way than its predecessor. [Full review in Spanish]
2684,1,"The story is more complex, and director Francis Lawrence did an even better job of integrating taut action and convincing special effects into a developing plot..."
2685,1,"Bigger, darker and more allegorical than ever, with Catching Fire, Frances Lawrence excels with visual splendor and the creation of the island where the Quarter Quell Games are held."
2686,1,The time and effort gone into Catching Fire does not go without notice.
2687,1,"Exciting, engaging and overall better than The Hunger Games, Catching Fire escapes being labelled as the 'dreaded sequel'."
2688,1,"The Hunger Games franchise is escapism and a wake-up call all at once, and Catching Fire rings that bell loud."
2689,1,"No one does both vulnerability, determination and strength better than Jennifer Lawrence."
2690,1,What sets The Hunger Games apart from other blockbusters of its type is how it doesn't use its violence as a crutch. It actually makes us feel the loss of its victims.
2691,1,"Nevertheless, the film and franchise will always thrive thanks to their phenomenal leading lady."
2692,1,"Francis Lawrence nicely balances stunts and spectacle with the growth of Katniss, who goes from teenaged girl to young woman with a wider worldview."
2693,1,"Despite sharing a similar narrative structure with the first film, Catching Fire ups the ante and heightens every element of the storytelling, from the drama to the stakes to the performances to the action."
2694,1,"The film's visual spectacle is still impressive, with a story that delves a little more into social disparity and class struggle... But the heartbeat of ""Catching Fire"" -- and the franchise in general -- remains Lawrence."
2695,1,"Such lofty dystopian concepts are certainly nothing new, but as with the first Hunger Games, there aren't many blockbuster sequels with half the guile, half the wit or half the heart of what we're treated to here."
2696,1,"Directed by Francis Lawrence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire satisfies and yet again leaves me wanting more."
2697,1,"It has far too many denouements for your average action-heavy film, but every one of them is important in laying ground for what's to come."
2698,1,"Jubilant, spellbinding and tactical, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is one of those acceptable moments where the majority of critics and moviegoers alike do not mind coming down with the sudden case of sequelitis."
2699,1,"Not only a superb action film that doubles as a sociopolitical rallying cry, but one of the finest, most dynamic 'part two' films in recent memory."
2700,1,"It is the Empire Strikes Back of the franchise, both in terms of story and achievement."
2701,1,"Stronger direction, better performances and a story that actually feels like it is headed somewhere special. Catching Fire more than lives up to the sky-high hype."
2702,1,This is how you make a blockbuster.
2703,1,Catching Fire is the rare film that's better than the original book.
2704,1,Catching Fire is a rare youth-targeted film that dares to ask some serious and uncomfortable questions.
2705,1,"Even by blockbuster standards, this is some heavily recycled material, and it's pretty long. But it's well done and will spirit away a cold Saturday afternoon nicely."
2706,1,Spine-chilling cinematography evokes that much required eerie feeling throughout. Dramatic costumes are another highlight. The film makes our hopelessness pit against our own indomitable spirit of survival. Who wins?
2707,1,Catching Fire is a big improvement on The Hunger Games and left me more enthusiastic about the franchise than the first installment did.
2708,0,"The first film in the series wasn't horrid, but the second outing takes a swan dive into dreck lake."
2709,1,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is about passion: the passion of love, the passion of power, and the passion of oppressed humanity that lives on hope."
2710,1,The strength of Katniss Everdeen as a character is what makes The Hunger Games: Catching Fire so compelling.
2711,0,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is much of the same: lots of standing around and talking without much in the way of flair or excitement.
2712,1,"Every returning detail of The Hunger Games is expanded and expounded in Catching Fire, and there is an unusual layering of the film's ambitions."
2713,1,"Vivid, visceral filmmaking, twisty and entertaining, with startlingly good turns by Jennifer Lawrence and Philip Seymour Hoffman."
2714,1,"Just as good a film as its predecessor, and a must-see chapter in this terrific and terrifying story."
2715,1,The movies (gratefully) violently counteract any attempt we might make to see them as fun escapism.
2716,0,"Whereas ""The Hunger Games"" made for some interesting political commentary, ""Catching Fire"" is content to rest on its laurels, adding nothing to the conversation."
2717,1,"Once skeptical, I'm now hooked."
2718,1,"There are plenty of characters and plenty of action to go around, yet thanks to its strong sense of suspense, Catching Fire doesn't feel as long as its near-two-and-a-half-hour running time might suggest."
2719,1,"A rousing, gritty spectacle of a movie."
2720,1,"Expertly executed without a dull stretch, despite an elongated running time, the second instalment based on Suzanne Collins's bestselling dystopian fantasy trilogy is a top-flight escapist adventure."
2721,1,"I'd love to report that this adds up to a great movie. It doesn't, but it does add up to a sequel that's a good deal more satisfying than its predecessor."
2722,1,What a difference a director makes.
2723,1,"While Catching Fire could easily stand on its own, it also should make audiences hungry for the next installment."
2724,1,"Not only surpasses its original but also brings with it the undeniable sense that yes, finally, all the maddening chaos and underlying pathos of this deeply political story has finally revealed an important subtext."
2725,1,"Though overlong at 146 minutes, Catching Fire retains the original's curiously-engaging mix of The Running Man, Spartacus, Ben Hur, Avatar and Rambo."
2726,1,"Lawrence is the rare female action-movie lead who carries on the fierce tradition of Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise -- easily the best and most enduring ""special effect"" this movie juggernaut has to offer eager audiences."
2727,1,"There's no Disneyfication; Catching Fire has a distinct look and sustained dark, gritty mood."
2728,1,It's an exciting watch and even slicker than the first film.
2729,0,"There's a depressing irony to the fact that The Hunger Games, a book series about the media's ability to placate the masses with superficial distractions, is now a mainstream film franchise that has spawned its own cult of celebrity."
2730,1,"As long as fully formed products like Catching Fire keep coming, the odds will be in The Hunger Games' favor to continue being celebrated as the definitive popular moral tale of the early 2000s."
2731,1,"By far the film's greatest asset is Jennifer Lawrence, who again brings absolute emotional conviction to her haunted and conflicted heroine."
2732,1,More (and better) Hunger Games
2733,1,"Lighter on action and futuristic visuals, Catching Fire is superior to the first film by virtue of notable performances and more compelling storyline. If the quality of the filmmaking continues into Mockingjay, I'll be thrilled to see how it ends."
2734,1,"Gary Ross did the hype justice by kicking off the series with a highly effective adaptation and now Francis Lawrence builds upon that success by taking the budget boost and funneling it into top talent, stunning visuals and an all-consuming experience."
2735,0,"As a long-time leftist, I expected something like ""Norma Rae"". It was much more Harry Potter or Twilight."
2736,1,"It is heartening to find a teen-oriented movie franchise as gritty as The Hunger Games. Even so, Catching Fire remains contradictory, caught in some nether world between nightmarish political allegory and adolescent escapism."
2737,1,"Sharp as a flaming arrow and as explosive as when one hits a powderkeg, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is the rousing, thought-provoking action epic the first movie failed to be."
2738,1,"The Games sequences, while familiar from the first film, push the story towards a thrilling cliffhanger climax."
2739,1,"The movie is a solid example of ""the book on film"" in spirit, and Lawrence is brilliant in a performance far beyond blockbuster-level acting."
2740,1,"The screenplay is terrific, with welcome shafts of wit."
2741,1,"Self-knowing, cynical, and urgently melodramatic, the Hunger Games and The Hunger Games indict you for watching it even as it asks you to buy in. And that is the genius of every iteration of the Games no one can ever win."
2742,1,"benefits from the impressive acting chops of Jennifer Lawrence, whose intensity and sense of self makes Katniss into a prototypical action heroine who embodies an ideal set of values but still stays psychologically and emotionally grounded."
2743,1,This is Empire Strikes Back stuff. It has that second Star Wars movie's kick of confidence.
2744,1,"Though flawed, Catching Fire manages something no adaptation since Harry Potter has: It respects its fans enough to challenge them while maturing alongside them."
2745,1,I went back and saw the first film again fairly quickly after seeing it the first time because I enjoyed it so much. Wouldn't elect to do that with this one.
2746,1,"Catching Fire focuses on the unfair dispensation of bread for the greater chunk of its hefty 146-minute running time, saving the circuses for dessert."
2747,1,"The first two-thirds of Catching Fire is truly compelling. Unfortunately, that last third is something else altogether."
2748,1,"Same old same old biding time for the finale, but still has Lawrence in the lead and for most that is enough."
2749,1,Conjures a convincingly scary and self-serving future dictatorship that connects it more truly to the 1970s tradition of protest science-fiction cinema ('Rollerball') than to its contemporary competition for teenage hearts and minds (the 'Twilight' saga).
2750,1,What keeps The Hunger Games: Catching Fire alive and kicking is its transcendent strain of humanity.
2751,1,You don't need the first weekend's grosses to predict a boxoffice inferno.
2752,1,"I hated the first one, but I really like this second one."
2753,1,A water-treading sequel that achieves its goal of satiating the fans' bloodlust while whetting their appetite for the franchise's grand finale.
2754,0,the type of movie you hope no one ever brings up in polite company because you don't want to look like an a******.
2755,1,"""Catching Fire"" is more substantial than the first feature because it delves deeper into themes such as loyalty, love, honor, sacrifice and freedom"
2756,1,The least interesting thing about The Hunger Games is the Hunger Games itself. A complete view of society in author Suzanne Collins' weather-beaten world remains tantalizingly out of reach.
2757,1,"Examines the price of being a celebrity, the dangers of idolatry, and how sometimes defiance of the status quo can have a dire outcome."
2758,1,This is 'The Empire Strikes Back' installment of the franchise.
2759,1,Events feel a little rushed at times but the strength of the story and its characters make this a series I've become a big fan of.
2760,1,"Full of action, drama and romance, 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' is every bit as entertaining as its predecessor. A 'link' movie, to be sure, but strong on its own, ""Catching Fire"" is certain to continue to do just that at the box office."
2761,1,"I was hoping this sequel to the first Hunger Games film would be better than the first one and it is, so that's good."
2762,1,"You would think the more entertaining part would be the games themselves, but instead it's the slower, more character-driven part of the film that holds the most interest."
2763,1,"the real emotional resonance is due exclusively to Lawrence, who moves through the film with an urgent determination that brings a visceral reality to even the most far-fetched of situations"
2764,1,Highly likely to be the best of all four Hunger Games pictures.
2765,1,There is no law of diminishing returns here. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is every bit as potent and gripping as its predecessor and a real triumph of entertainment.
2766,1,"... a sequel that, for once, doesn't coddle its target audience ... Lawrence's quick-draw archer is, if anything, more intense and single-minded, all glowering charisma."
2767,1,"Director Francis Lawrence's film runs nearly two-and-a-half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly, it leaves you wanting more."
2768,0,Talk about starvation! Catching Fire is sadly lacking in visual nutrition.
2769,1,"A little long, but still entertaining, installment in the popular franchise."
2770,1,"Thought it never truly catches fire, this two-and-a-half-hour sequel includes enough virtues to fill an entertaining ninety minutes."
2771,1,"Like Katniss, Lawrence has become bigger than the Games themselves, something that makes her very powerful, very dangerous and rather inspirational."
2772,1,"Last Call for Istanbul wows in a truly unexpected way. While the story initially feels familiar, it turns into something unique, making sure that the fantastic chemistry between the film’s leads is not squandered on a run-of-the-mill romance tale."
2773,1,"Last Call for Istanbul wows in a truly unexpected way. While the story initially feels familiar, it turns into something unique, making sure that the fantastic chemistry between the film’s leads is not squandered on a run-of-the-mill romance tale."
2774,1,"Last Call for Istanbul wows in a truly unexpected way. While the story initially feels familiar, it turns into something unique, making sure that the fantastic chemistry between the film’s leads is not squandered on a run-of-the-mill romance tale."
2775,1,"Last Call for Istanbul wows in a truly unexpected way. While the story initially feels familiar, it turns into something unique, making sure that the fantastic chemistry between the film’s leads is not squandered on a run-of-the-mill romance tale."
2776,1,"Last Call for Istanbul wows in a truly unexpected way. While the story initially feels familiar, it turns into something unique, making sure that the fantastic chemistry between the film’s leads is not squandered on a run-of-the-mill romance tale."
2777,1,A definite improvement over the previous picture.
2778,1,"Equalizer 3 is the fifth collaboration between Fuqua and Washington, and the results are pretty similar to their other films."
2779,1,"The Equalizer 3 is not a franchise limping to its final act. If anything, the third installment of the series makes a very strong case for at least one more chapter."
2780,1,"It would be highly unfair to evaluate 'The Equalizer 3' in terms of whether it's better or worse than the two preceding titles, It's more appropriate to label it as a complementary and equally satisfying bet that shares the foundation of its genetic code."
2781,0,"Fuqua and Washington prefer that McCall be feared as a vigilante. They seem uninterested in the mechanics of the spy world and the elegance of the first television series. In their three “Equalizer” films, the specter of violence is what thrills them."
2782,1,"Although the film does not assume the conventions of an action film, the dramatic pulse is fueled by Washington and his interactions with the rest of the cast. [Full review in Spanish]"
2783,1,"Fuqua directs with style, taking his time, developing a palpable atmosphere of tension, and even including some religious imagery, as if to give an additional symbolic dimension to the story. And Washington, as always, shines. Full review in Spanish."
2784,1,A tremendously fun action movie. [Full review in Spanish]
2785,1,Fuqua and Washington put a bloody bow on one of our best and most underrated action franchises. [Full Review in Spanish]
2786,1,"... Equally tense and predictable, but dominated by the incomparable presence of its protagonist. [Full review in Spanish]"
2787,0,"Does it entertain? Yes, until it tires you out. [Full review in Spanish]"
2788,1,"In the hands of another team and starring another actor, Equalizer 3 would be a generic revenge film. [Full review in Spanish]"
2789,1,"Like Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington doesn't seem to get any older as an action hero... [Full review in Spanish]"
2790,1,Antoine Fuqua’s direction gives the film momentum.
2791,1,"If it's not broke, then don't fix it. They haven't fixed it in 40 years, and they didn't fix it in this movie, either."
2792,1,"You watch these movies for the same rush you get from a superhero film, except Denzel is not a superhero and he doesn't need to be. That makes it so much better -- he's flesh and blood."
2793,0,“The Equalizer” films have always been junk; they’re based on a mid-1980s TV show that was no great shakes to begin with. What did Washington ever see in them?
2794,1,"For those that have enjoyed McCall’s violently cathartic journey, The Equalizer 3 is here to please"
2795,1,"A straightforward tale of good guys versus bad guys, all centred on the presence of Washington"
2796,0,"Despite the film’s virtues, the formula it follows is simple, and simplistic: Bad guys do really bad things to good people; hero does really bad things to bad guys. The end."
2797,1,"Based on a long-running television series, “The Equalizer” franchise doesn’t expand much, either. Unlike “Mission: Impossible,” it settles for a blue-chip star and a well-worn premise."
2798,1,Washington and Fuqua give audiences what they want and need with some action sequences that will ring in your brain for days.  Denzel is back baby!
2799,1,"The saving grace is Fuqua's portrait of Italy, which glows with an ethereal warmth. You can tell he has a real fondness for these people, their culture, their joy and the cobblestone streets which they call home."
2800,1,…the change to a more exotic setting and the scalding photography of Robert Richardson elevate The Equaliser 3 to the best of a series that always had high professional standards…
2801,1,"I'd like to see The Equalizer have one last cameo in another hitman franchise link-up, go out in a blaze of vigilante glory, and be put out to pasture permanently. Still good, but getting tired."
2802,1,"You have to expect a lot of violence in a movie like this, but the overly graphic way the violence is presented did put me off a bit, even so. Still, it is a good, solid action movie, and a worthy sequel."
2803,1,"It feels like a horror film; like you're watching Jason or Michael Myers, except Denzel is the boogeyman in this case... and that smile that he has at the very beginning, that's his mask."
2804,1,"If you've glossed over the stellar first feature and therefore missed the sequel, but are now intrigued by the release of a third in an unprecedented Denzel Washington franchise - Equalizer 3 is the reason to catch up."
2805,0,"Are you sitting down? Because Denzel Washington sure is in what amounts to a well-shot, on-location version of those sad DTV movies where Steven Seagal largely confines himself to a chair."
2806,1,...agreeably familiar subject matter that’s employed to erratic yet watchable effect by Fuqua...
2807,1,"Michael Myers (as in the slasher, and not the comedian) ain’t got nothing on Robert McCall, Washington’s widower, veteran, retired intelligence operative and self-appointed lone protector of everyday people"
2808,1,"While some action directors may be content with capturing edgy, dimly lit imagery to cover their cinematic mayhem, three time Oscar-winner Richardson was given reign to go further."
2809,0,"That’s enough equalizing now, thank you very much."
2810,1,It's very grim and incredibly bloody with no real surprises - I'm sure you can guess how it ends - but since Denzel is one of the best - he elevates the material in a way that only he can by lighting up the screen.
2811,1,"Aided by Fuqua’s slick production, [Washington] he’s an old school movie star still very much in his prime, killing it (and everyone else) for our trashy viewing pleasure."
2812,0,"A particular franchise favorite is slamming a head into a glass table so that the camera can shoot the sickening thunk from below. If that sounds like your kind of thing, stop reading this and buy a ticket."
2813,0,Denzel seems to be sleepwalking through every scene that doesn’t involve gouging and/or stabbing.
2814,1,Denzel Washington caps off his vigilantism in an Italian town with equal gore & gravitas. There’s a quiet dignity to him whether he’s brandishing violence or benevolence.
2815,1,"Assuming this is the last ride for the Equalizer series, they went out on top, and there couldn’t be a better time for it at the theatre."
2816,1,"Whether enjoying a cappuccino, flirting with a waitress or snapping men’s forearms, Washington makes it all seem like a movie star enjoying a midlife dolce vita moment."
2817,1,"Even though this looks as it will be the last of The Equalizers we will see for the time being, it is clearly the best of them."
2818,1,"The Equalizer 3 marks a fitting and warm end to the franchise. It offers all the audacious violence and familiar set-pieces of the previous films, paired with a wistful goodbye to its central vigilante."
2819,1,And incredible on-screen reunion for Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning 19 years later after Man on Fire. My favorite Equalizer film yet!
2820,0,"Without any moral foundation, this action-movie sequel gives its protagonist (and its audience) the same license to enjoy killing as reckless horror-film sensationalism does."
2821,0,"A film where a talented director and superstar actor are simply going through the motions, lending an undertone of apathy that’s impossible to overcome."
2822,1,"Clearly Fuqua, the producers and production team are hoping viewers like their attention to aesthetics. Their dream may come true."
2823,1,"The series’ third installment benefits from a fish-out-of-water story and the gravitas of its star, eventually making The Equalizer 3 the most entertaining entry."
2824,1,"This is a very intense, it is violent, but a good action flick. Denzel Washington is phenomenal in everything he does and this is another example of why he's one our best actors today."
2825,1,"Finally, on the series’ supposedly last outing, one of its films lives up to the ever-deepening talent of its leading man."
2826,1,You know what you're getting from 'The Equalizer 3' and it's pointless expecting any more from it. It's not trying to be anything other than something that's made by talented craftspeople to do nothing other than boil the pot.
2827,1,"The Equalizer 3 is precisely the film one would expect it to be (if a little more bloated in places than it requires) and if it is indeed the end of the series, the film is its high point."
2828,1,We shift pace in the last offering of Mr McCall and the lovable friends he meets along the way. Charming remnants of what made this franchise so much fun.
2829,1,"Equalizer 3 scales new heights in grandeur, overshadowing its predecessors. With Washington and Fanning's nostalgic reunion against Italy's backdrop, it's a cinematic feast, albeit not without its familiar flavors."
2830,1,"This is a great hour and 49 minutes of action film, and I wholeheartedly recommend it."
2831,1,"At its best – and The Equalizer 3 is about as good as the first film -- it neatly counterbalances Fuqua’s baroque, blood-and-guts action with Washington’s ability to command attention while sitting perfectly still."
2832,1,"The movie is bloody and never boring, the featuring dazzling oceanfront locations, textured cinematography, and a heartwarming message about finding community."
2833,1,"The action scenes are horribly ­entertaining, but McCall is just as deadly with a withering smile."
2834,0,"The Equalizer 3 is simply a more stylish repeat of the following pattern: He came, he killed, he kept on going."
2835,1,"This nearly decade long franchise manages to go out with style, gravitas, and a few surprises."
2836,1,"This is being called the final chapter for this brutal vigilante hero, and Denzel Washington is back to give the movie some superb gravitas and just a hint of morality."
2837,0,"Unfortunately, the third Equalizer movie is the weakest in the series. The Equalizer 3 is yet another example of diminishing returns."
2838,0,"Ultimately this third entry leaves off on a vaguely dissatisfying note, as if the series went one sequel too far."
2839,0,"It’s a step up from the messy plot of the 2018 sequel, but this movie swings too far the other way."
2840,1,"McCall’s third outing is bloody, brutally efficient and oh-so-beautiful!"
2841,0,Fuqua & Denzel are on vacation and the latter seems completely checked out emotionally and often physically as the shockingly brutal action is far between usually showing only the aftermath and inserts of the actor's footsteps.
2842,1,The European style of filmmaking that Fuqua adopts with this film makes it the best in the trilogy.
2843,0,"I like my implausible stories to be more plausible, and for me to be more emotionally involved."
2844,1,It's good entertainment that's slightly lifted above average because Denzel Washington is such a brilliant actor.
2845,1,"While there are no surprises here, there are visceral kicks to be found in the businesslike efficiency of McCall’s retribution, and the devilish glint in Washington’s eye as he delivers it."
2846,1,"While this outing is as gory as its predecessors -- a bloody, bone-crunching, axe-to-the-head tale of right over wrong -- it’s tempered by a high regard for craft and a reluctance to rush. The pace suits Washington."
2847,1,The best in the series.
2848,0,"...makes no sense...old, overweight Washington unbelievable as a man of action...the denouement is so utterly absurd that what came before just validates the idea that Fuqua really didn’t have any idea where to go with this, so he just winged it."
2849,1,"Everybody likes to see Denzel give the bad guys a beat down, and that's what you'll find."
2850,0,"This ultraviolent third installment in the vigilante action franchise finds Washington back in top form. However, changing the setting and rearranging the narrative puzzle pieces isn’t enough to freshen a well-worn concept."
2851,1,"The Equalizer 3 is the messiest of the three movies and the most narratively fractured, but it should still satisfy those who consider themselves to be fans."
2852,1,Surprisingly poignant and resonant.
2853,1,"There's still stuff I liked in this one, but I was kind of disappointed."
2854,1,"Grim and violent, this franchise still has some blood in its veins, even if it does get a bit cartoony at times."
2855,1,McCall came across as a tightly wound spring inside a tranquil shell. He was more often on defense than offense and this time it is reversed. It makes for an acceptable action film but doesn’t have the same crispness as the previous [films].
2856,1,Fuqua is able to focus on what makes these movies weirdly delightful: Watching the very strange yet endearing character of Robert McCall... charming the innocent while striking fear into the hearts of those who should fear righteous justice.
2857,1,There is some snappy dialogue and comebacks in this film... It's every bit as entertaining to watch as the action.
2858,1,"Given the simplicity of the basic template, Fuqua and Wenk cleverly weave together the various strands. The effect provides the movie with more emotional resonance, even if the overarching threat and big crime boss are almost wholly generic."
2859,1,"After three entries of variable quality and varying body counts, the Equalizer series has settled into comfortable familiarity with Washington holding the center with a mix of irony-free gravitas and movie-star charisma."
2860,1,"""The Threequalizer"" is easily the best entry in the series, and Washington's best work in the action space in more than a decade. Consider it a relaxing vacation with a side order of violence."
2861,1,"A brutally efficient addition to the Equalizer franchise. The villains are a bit overly generic and action scenes are not as articulate but the heart of the story, the beautiful Italian setting, and the delivery of Denzel's Robert McCall make up for it."
2862,0,"With a sluggish storyline, peculiar plot holes and villains who turn from callously cruel to child-like within seconds, this is a film with many problems."
2863,0,The Equalizer 3 is a near-lifeless chapter in this series that will only be remembered for how one of our greatest living actors can elevate tedious material through his reliable acting craft and magnetic presence
2864,1,"A pure slice of exploitive pulp that isn’t afraid of offering audiences a little fan service in the name of a good, sleazy time."
2865,0,"At one point, Fanning attempts to spy on Robert, sneaking a photo while he sits sipping espresso. He turns, offering a big irresistible smile for the camera. The whole film is that pose, be it while holding a wine glass or a derrière-destroying shotgun."
2866,1,"Washington is terrifically charismatic as the methodical killing machine, adding a spark of understated delight to McCall's metamorphosis. There's a new sense of ease heretofore missing from a character who, while always calm, was also always on guard."
2867,0,I feel bad for the people who will go see The Equalizer 3 thinking it’s going to be an action movie.
2868,1,"The overarching plot of the film is pretty boilerplate, but the fine details count for a lot."
2869,0,“The Equalizer 3” is hot garbage. It’s also a fascinating but failed attempt by Fuqua and Washington to make their own Mann-Stewart film.
2870,1,"Denzel Washington’s threequelizer is an all-you-can-stomach buffet of violent delights and ends, and an affectionate goodbye to a modern B-movie legend."
2871,1,"Washington is as convincing as ever, showing a fierce (and often frightening) intensity in the action scenes and a genuine warmth and humanity in others."
2872,1,"It delivers the goods, thanks to Washington’s performance and Fuqua’s zest for going graphic."
2873,0,"The Equalizer 3 itself, unfortunately, doesn't come close to matching the impact of Washington's presence."
2874,1,"The Equalizer 3 asks of McCall whether he can ever really find peace. It asks us, the viewer, a slightly different question: Do we even really want him to?"
2875,1,"Ignore the many problems in this violent revenge thriller and focus on the power and charisma of Denzel Washington who ends the third and final chapter in his Equalizer trilogy on a euphoric high. He’s a star, baby, and him you don’t want to miss."
2876,0,"The Equalizer movies are not known for rapid pacing, but No. 3 really ramps up the shambling languidness. It may hold your attention. But at the end of a summer of exciting new Indiana Jones and Mission: Impossible chapters, that may be asking a lot."
2877,1,"A perennial childhood favorite gets a fittingly cozy and touching adaptation [...] The switches [in animation style] allow the movie to play on both nostalgia and imagination, a dual-handed approach that deepens its emotional impact."

2907,1,"Bill Burr looks like he's doing stand-up during most of it. Bobby Cannavale is hilarious in a very broad, crazy, zany kind of way..."
2908,1,"Bill Burr's stand-up comedy rocks, his acting is surprisingly good, and his directing debut is promising. Especially since ""Old Dads"" advocates for a demographic that doesn't get a lot of visibility these days."
2909,1,"Very funny... serves up a sound backhander to the insipid nature of woke culture where offense is taken at every turn...Burr, who co-wrote with Ben Tishler, proves himself a fine director, giving each character arc, even the supporting ones, their due."
2910,0,"Old Dads is funny for a bit but quickly overstays its welcome, resulting in a disjointed movie that never quite pulls itself together."
2911,1,"The title ""Old Dads"" is misleading. If you're a new middle-aged parent, there's surprisingly little in the ""promise of the premise."" As written, it might as well be called ""Old Guys"" as it's mostly Gen X mocking Gen Z. Still, the ""Braveheart"" bit crushes."
2912,1,A vulgar and unfunny comedy.
2913,0,"Quality-wise, it lands squarely in the middle of the pack, which is probably just good enough for its intended audience. For the rest of us, it's another throwaway comedy with stale jokes and a watered-down premise."
2914,0,"It amounts to comedian Bill Burr turning his stand-up act into a feature with a three-act structure and supporting characters. If you like Burr, you’ll be in familiar territory and perhaps be able to simply go along with what’s presented."
2915,0,"At least try to be relevant, Mr. Burr, instead of telling jokes recycled from old episodes of According to Jim."
2916,0,"What’s considered fun and acceptable may not be anyone, so where do I fit in? However, things feel included to have something to shake a fist at."
2917,1,"The movie as a whole is just a clothesline to hang a string of grievances against an ultra-sensitive and hypocritical society, but like Bill Burr's stand-up material when it hits it can be very funny."
2918,1,"The writing sometimes collapses into overkill, but sometimes it is precisely on point."
2919,1,"Old Dads director/co-writer/star Burr understands the hypocrisy of some behavior among both millennials and Gen Xers, and there are a handful of very funny lines here."
2920,0,"Here, his “woe-is-me” act loses steam quickly, as “Old Dads” wears out its welcome like the old man you pretend to listen to but couldn’t care less what he’s saying."
2921,0,"Rather than challenge himself, Burr instead uses the film to adapt his schtick into a three-hander bro comedy addressing the generational divide regarding modern mores and language."
2922,0,"Bill Burr's film isn’t the worst directorial debut by any means of the phrase, but the film's raunchy comedy fails to say something meaningful."
2923,0,"A number of big laughs can be found in the picture, yet the refusal to stick with its central idea grows frustrating."
2924,0,"The spectacle of watching a “bully” punch down at assorted cultural straw men, with his “boys” there to high five him after he does. That gets old fast, “Dad.”"
2925,0,"A boorish and obnoxiously vulgar comedy that, since it can’t claim any other great distinction, might well have been expressly written to break the all-time record for use of the f-word in the major studio movie."
2926,0,"As hot as he is on stage, Bill Burr picked a lousy time to try migrating his angry-guy act to movies, as he does in the fitfully funny Old Dads."
2927,1,"It’s uneven in its pacing, a patchwork of scenes that just barely hold together thanks to the strength of Burr’s credibility as one of the world’s best working standups, which helps cover for his lack of polish as a filmmaker."
2928,0,"The characters aren't really characters so much as they're stand-ins and targets for Burr's ideas and jokes, and those jokes are as stale as the Kaitlyn Jenner material Burr dusts off here."
2929,0,"The whole ""does it offend you, yeah?"" routine only works if someone commits to it, and Burr is too much of a softy at heart to go all the way. He doesn’t want to piss people off, he just wants to air his grievances about progressive culture."
2930,0,"A meandering, unfunny assault on PC culture that would seem perfectly in place in the 1990s alongside “Illiberal Education” by Dinesh D’Souza and the rantings of Pat Buchanan. It’s so dated there’s even a mention of Halliburton."
2931,0,Old Dads has a frustrating narrative structure that doesn’t lend itself to what is actually funny here
2932,0,"Rhetoric and drama are different beasts, and while Burr can construct strawmen and women on stage to knock down in an entertaining way, they become caricatures when embodied by actors on screen."
2933,0,"Late-blooming comedian Bill Burr steps behind the camera for this Netflix comedy that's pretty standard and broad, but showcases his gift for generational beefs and snark."
2934,0,"""Old Dads"" has a great cast, but it's barely a movie."
2935,0,It is obvious that this is one of those funny films that can only make a section of people laugh. Are you among them?
2936,0,A movie full of thoroughly unlikable characters... heavy in its criticism but sparse in its actual humor.
2937,0,"When not being used to grind dull culture-war axes, sputtering impotent anger is a comedy staple. It just needs to be funnier than this."
2938,0,"Given the unapologetic, sharp-edged tone of Burr’s comedy, it’s surprising that as director, co-writer and star of this vehicle, he played it so safe."
2939,1,"If you find Burr’s stand-up routines funny, you’ll enjoy Old Dads, which also benefits from Cannavale’s hilariously beleaguered reactions, Woodbine’s solid underplaying and some very funny turns by a variety of comedians in small roles."
2940,0,"Burr's directorial debut plays it too safe, clean, & far too tepid for a film that should have been Bad Moms with some serious verve."
2941,1,"Burr is skilled at this, for sure. And Woodbine and Cannavale, who are better actors overall, slide into Burr’s mode with ease. The results will prove satisfactory and maybe cathartic for his fans."
2942,0,"Old Dads is at its best when it highlights Jack's evolution and Burr's humor, and as for the rest of the movie, it's simply too much interference too often."
2943,0,"It’s like an extension of Burr’s recent standup material, which is just as offensive as the stuff that Dave Chappelle has been putting out, but doesn’t attract as much outrage because not enough people are aware it exists."
2944,0,"As a director, Burr displays discomfort in letting any meaningful moment breathe."
2945,1,"Old Dads is the perfect streaming movie. On top of that, it is the perfect date night movie. With the well-balanced mix of comedy and drama, you can sit down and enjoy this with a loved one and have a good time."
2946,0,"As a fan of Bill Burr, I think his directorial debut suffers from him having to share the spotlight. The beauty of his comedy is that he's saying the things we can't. It's not as fun when we have characters explaining why his comments aren't funny."
2947,0,"Empathy for clowns isn’t happening, along with inspired ideas in “Old Dads,” which teeters on the edge of becoming “Old Man Yells at Cloud: The Movie.”"
2948,0,"The attempts to be offensive fail, the emotional beats are never effective, and despite a handful of good laughs and amusing cameos, it's never that funny. Burr is a force to be reckoned with on the stage, but his directorial debut is the exact opposite."
2949,0,There is humor in people not happy with anything past 1987 and the ever-changing times. But it also wears thin after incessant macho postering. Enough with anatomy jokes!
2950,0,"Empathy for clowns isn’t happening, along with inspired ideas in “Old Dads,” which teeters on the edge of becoming “Old Man Yells at Cloud: The Movie.”"
2951,0,"The attempts to be offensive fail, the emotional beats are never effective, and despite a handful of good laughs and amusing cameos, it's never that funny. Burr is a force to be reckoned with on the stage, but his directorial debut is the exact opposite."
2952,0,There is humor in people not happy with anything past 1987 and the ever-changing times. But it also wears thin after incessant macho postering. Enough with anatomy jokes!

2955,0,There is humor in people not happy with anything past 1987 and the ever-changing times. But it also wears thin after incessant macho postering. Enough with anatomy jokes!
2956,0,"Reptile lets all the drama happen off screen with a third act deus ex machina. What could have been a knotty, suburban, coastal noir boils down to a detective story we’ve all seen before."
2957,1,"This is a dreary and somewhat tense crime drama that features a fascinating and compelling lead performance. Del Toro crushes it, but the mystery surrounding his character doesn’t quite come together as intended"
2958,0,Excellent performances aren’t enough to salvage this labyrinthine slog saturated with equal parts premeditated diversion and gloomy atmosphere. Not even del Toro can make this work.
2959,0,"Though the film’s plot, including its resolution, is routine, Del Toro and Silverstone keep things interesting. I’d love to see them return as these characters in a more compelling story."
2960,1,A pretty effective murder mystery... [Benicio Del Toro] has aged very nicely into this sort of role.
2961,1,"Eventually, Reptile becomes tangled and leaves some of its subplots as loose ends, but Singer’s film is an impressively solid and slimy procedural."
2962,0,"What begins as a taut crime story ends as anything but. In fact, the finale leaves a couple of questions unanswered."
2963,1,"Grant Singer puts in plenty of nice touches to stress a seedy environment, and del Toro gets a lot of lived-in aspects to his role to play with, but the film still can’t entirely shed the feel of being a “lesser than” attempt at a strong cinematic effort."
2964,1,"Reptile, whose name is never fully explained, packs quite a lot into the fast-moving story, though at over two hours, it could have been condensed more."
2965,0,"It's too convoluted and it feels like a low-rent ""True Detective"". At the heart of it, it could have been fantastic, but the execution of this film was poorly done."
2966,1,"Reptile shines in various aspects, and its flaws can easily be overlooked. Watch it for Del Toro's compelling performance and Fincher's influence (particularly in the first half)."
2967,1,"Some leaps of logic lessen a well acted, twisty thriller."
2968,0,"Sadly, you still need to stick the landing, and Reptile does a good job of drawing us into the mystery, it just rushes the ending and that feels like a crime."
2969,0,"Gets points for holding your interest, but loses them for botching the close...it twists itself into such pretzel formations in an attempt to surprise that by the end the ludicrousness has overwhelmed the mood it worked so hard to establish."
2970,1,"Benicio Del Toro makes this whole thing work. If it were an hour and a half, it'd be a 4-star. At it's current unwieldy length, it's a 3-star. Still a good watch."
2971,0,"""Reptile"" isn't a terrible film. There will be a specific crowd that enjoys it. There are just better offerings out there."
2972,1,"A very absorbing whodunnit procedural assembled with cooly unnerving aplomb, like a David Fincher thriller."
2973,1,"Frustratingly, the underlying themes aren't robust enough to make this vastly overlong film very memorable, rehashing the usual exhausted good cop scenario. It's beautifully shot and acted, but a bit more earthy momentum would have given it a real kick."
2974,0,"Del Toro’s solid screen charisma can’t rescue Reptile, a derivative and lethargic thriller that rarely thrills as it tries and fails to build a case for itself as a meaningful iteration on the detective thrillers that it admires."
2975,0,After a fast start the middle part falters.
2976,0,"Like the snake of its title, it slithers ominously enough to send some shivers up the spine. But it’s also a bit too slow and deliberate for its own good, even if its venomous bite can draw some blood."
2977,0,Benicio del Toro is unsurprising but constantly watchable. It helps that the character’s marriage avoids cop-movie clichés by being fairly happy.
2978,0,"And in the aimless comings and goings, Reptiles becomes increasingly less attractive. [Full review in Spanish]"
2979,1,"The film has a concise script, which gradually opens rifts for us to find out along with Tom, from the armchair at home, what is behind the real estate business. [Full review in Spanish]"
2980,0,The fallout from all this purposeful gloom isn't merely that nothing surprises us; even Del Toro's committed portrayal of a careful man's gathering disillusionment gets jammed up.
2981,0,"It's perfectly watchable, but let it play on during the bathroom breaks and search for snacks. It's so slow you probably won't miss anything vital, not until the third act."
2982,0,If it more closely focused on Del Toro & Silverstone's mutual deductions on the crimes at hand it may have had something. Instead it feels like all those twisty thrillers in the wake of The Usual Suspects until you're wondering what was all that about.
2983,1,"Del Toro, who worked on the script crafted by director Grant Singer and Benjamin Brewer, has a meaty role that – like much of the cast – plays him against type."
2984,1,"It’s handsomely made with strong, committed performances, but it plays so closely to the blueprint that it never establishes an identity of its own."
2985,1,Benicio Del Toro's magnetic presence is captivating in an atmospheric slow burn that satisfies more as a crime thriller than as a murder mystery. [Full Review in Spanish]
2986,1,"Del Toro is understated & withdrawn, expertly capturing an inquisitive detective with a damaged past. While the reveal of the mystery does arrive too soon, reducing the impact of the finale, everything that comes before it is riveting with uneasy tension."
2987,0,"A meandering, routine, mundane slog creating an illusion of thrills when, in reality, nothing interesting is happening"
2988,0,...stellar acting alone can’t mask most of the shortcomings in Reptile.
2989,1,"Del Toro carries this sometimes convoluted and derivative thriller into three-star territory with an absolutely mesmerizing and authentic performance that conjures up memories of past anti-hero greats such as Bogart and Mitchum, Ryan and Hayden."
2990,1,"... The most eccentric character, Michael Pitt's sort of Neo-grunge man with psychopathic traits, makes some of the scenes in the just over two hours sufficiently attractive and inspired to help us get through the end. [Full review in Spanish]"
2991,0,"Though at times entertaining, the movie fails to escape the shadows of its influences and leaves us with the sensation of a wasted opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]"
2992,0,"Benicio del Toro's understated performance as a soft-spoken detective is about the only interesting thing about this new Netflix thriller, which drowns a thin murder mystery in lots of ominous atmosphere."
2993,0,"The circuitous plotting is hampered by unlikely coincidences that mount before the tangled finale, as Singer's initially promising pulp-noir character piece is buckled by its loftier pretensions."
2994,0,"This slick and atmospheric murder mystery is best when it’s more about the investigator than the investigation. However, all the melodramatic twists and narrative misdirection can’t disguise the underlying familiarity of the material."
2995,0,"There is a strange character study yearning to break out of the new Netflix thriller ""Reptile,"" made all the more baffling by the fact that the movie surrounding this character study is a fairly stale crime drama."
2996,1,Del Toro and Silverstone make a meal out of what tends to be a pro forma side to these kinds of thrillers
2997,1,"A good-looking, engaging B-movie made with uncommon intelligence. Music video director Grant Singer’s feature debut is no perfect object, but it is decidedly, and often successfully, aspiring to be something more than just toss-off streaming content."
2998,0,"Easily the worst big budget detective thriller since The Snowman a few years back, Reptile eventually lures the viewer in by making them question how this could’ve gone so wrong given the talent involved."
2999,0,It's easy to admire how Reptile attempts to do things a bit differently  ... It's also easy to begrudge this movie's eventual shift toward the routinely straightforward and the unnecessarily convoluted.
3000,0,"Reptile gets an extra edge thanks to its rock-solid cast and sufficiently gripping mystery, but it never coalesces into anything incredible."
3001,0,"Less ""whodunit"", more ""who cares?"""
3002,1,"Reptile’s main strength is del Toro. He shares great chemistry with Silverstone, his co-star in 1997’s Excess Baggage, but it is his character's combination of tenaciousness and eccentricity that are the movie’s most original components."
3003,0,"Once the film gets around to revealing the culprit, we have already lost interest, enervated in the face of a movie that, like an overeager snake, bites off far more than it can swallow."
3004,1,"Reptile is an atmospheric Southern crime thriller dripping with an ominous and obsessive style that gradually seeps under the skin, keeping the viewer on edge and making them uneasy."
3005,1,"Del Toro doesn’t disappoint. Humorous, serious, determined."
3006,1,"A solid, gloomy detective thriller that works thanks to Benicio del Toro's stellar performance and the slimy, moody atmosphere created by first-time director Grant Singer. [Full review in Spanish]"
3007,0,"Elements work in “Reptile,” especially police brotherhood material, but it doesn’t add up to much in this underwhelming study of crime and punishment (and faucets)."
3008,1,What sets it apart is the strange and slightly offbeat vibe that permeates the entire movie. “Reptile” is very much a crime thriller. But (Grant) Singer takes it in some peculiar and even darkly funny directions.
3009,0,"Reptile feels as though it’s been through an especially ruthless edit, and it carries the scars of trying to distill a tense tapestry about corruption and morality into something streamlined and easily digestible."
3010,0,"A distended dirge of digressions & dream sequences that never distract from equally superficial murder plots & psychological profiles. With respect to Benicio Del Toro & Alicia Silverstone’s previous collaboration, ""Excess Baggage"" makes more sense here."
3011,0,"Reptile, from its score to its performances, is all mood and little else."
3012,1,The bulky physical presence of Del Toro himself gives the film its momentum and force.
3013,1,“Reptile” tugs you along with a competent and accessible intrigue.
3014,1,REPTILE is a murder mystery that packs enough twists and turns to keep even the best amateur sleuth guessing.
3015,1,The suspense in REPTILE is sustained throughout. The film is an intelligently written murder whodunit that will keep audiences guessing until the very end.
3016,0,"Such tension ultimately unravels during a latter half that rushes through too many underwhelming revelations, but that’s not enough to completely offset the film’s beguiling air of despondency."
3017,0,Reptile just feels wayward and listless.
3018,1,"Every other actor in the movie — from Timberlake, to Eric Bogosian as Nichols’ boss, to Domenick Lombardozzi as his colleague — seems to have been cast as an irresistible force to be thrown against Del Toro’s immovable object."
3019,1,The screenwriting trio often leans on perceptions initiated by characters and the actors playing them to present a watchable whodunnit after the early and brutal murder of a real estate agent (Matilda Lutz).
3020,0,"Reptile is something of a noble misfire, willing to take risks with the genre and its expectations even if the end result leaves a bit to be desired."
3021,1,"This sleek and noirish whodunit-slash-police procedural is a showcase for Benicio Del Toro but it's incredibly twisty, both a strength and a weakness."
3022,0,"At the heart of Reptile lies Del Toro’s stellar, captivating performance…[but]what remains is a bloated, maximalist exercise in pastiche, one that is stupidly easy to decipher."
3023,1,“Reptile” coils itself into many unexpected crevasses.
3024,0,Characters exist for no reason other than to be suspicious.
3025,0,"Some elements are overdone, strong decisions are replaced by bad ones, and the final act is a disaster.  [Full review in Spanish]"
3026,0,"It is a long and boring film, with few other respites from the tedium, but Del Toro, for whatever reason, is just captivating."
3027,0,Reptile is an empty vessel lacking the creativity to elevate this first feature amongst a stellar year of directorial debuts.
3028,1,"Offers enough deceit, red herrings, needle drops, and superb character work to make it rise about the usual Netflix suspects."
3029,1,"Reptile is a suspenseful, clever, and visually stunning piece of work."
3030,0,"In “Reptile” the density is less satisfying than it is irritating. A good thriller can go in lots of different directions, but it should never be this tiresome."
3031,0,"Attempting to be a sleek thriller befitting of ""The Departed,"" the movie sputters out of control set to the tune of an ear-pinching score by Yair Elazar Glotman."
3032,1,"A quirky, darkly comic cop thriller with a knockout performance from Benicio del Toro."
3033,0,"Grant Singer’s feature directorial debut suffers from an overinflated sense of grandeur and a frustratingly convoluted story, reaching for dramatic heights that it hasn’t earned."
3034,0,"In an effort to prove its cleverness, Reptile clanks, rattles and stumbles in its second half. The tricks that initially impressed eventually become hard to endure."
3035,0,Reptile is a compelling police procedural until it overstays its welcome.
3036,0,"Wants to be a David Fincher procedural with Steven Soderbergh’s paranoia, but it is a merely fangless homage without suspense, logic, or shame."
3037,1,"If Reptile sounds like a familiar story to you, that’s because it is. It’s not aspiring to reinvent the crime thriller, and it really doesn’t need to."
3038,0,This true-life saga of capitalism run amok is neither as enlightening nor as infuriating as intended.
3039,0,"Honestly, this plays like the movie all the actors made but decided to remove all references to it because they were so ashamed by the results."
3040,0,"Yates leans too heavily on cutesy timing, flimsy seriousness, and cliche. There are no fingerprints of an artist to be found, just a chunk of content to be lost in the algorithm, which isn’t such a bad thing when the film is absolute piffle."
3041,0,"The messaging is thorny, with a lighthearted, glib attitude that makes the film seem confused with its own intentions."
3042,0,"Pain Hustlers is entertaining-enough, but there is a lack of focus that makes the story feel like one big missed opportunity. The buildup features great performances, but the finale is familiar and rushed. It lacks the style it strives for."
3043,1,Emily Blunt can do no wrong. She is totally captivating in this timely film.
3044,0,"Unfortunately, the filmmakers let Blunt down by never quite nailing the tone of bemused outrage the material demands. Evans cops it even worse with a poorly written role as Liza’s cynical boss."
3045,0,"The morality tale that is Pain Hustlers shifts tones abruptly in its third act, where greedy and unethical characters get their comeuppance."
3046,0,“Pain Hustlers” is overlong and at times frustratingly dull. But perhaps its biggest offense lies in its focus. The movie is so honed in on its disgustingly wealthy profiteers that the true victims (the people who actually died) barely have a voice.
3047,1,"Yates elicits compelling, commanding work from his leads that effectively elevates the proceedings on a recurring basis..."
3048,1,It's very entertaining but unfortunately somewhat morally bereft.
3049,0,"Pain Hustlers aims high and means well, but Yates directs this annoyingly untidy film like it’s The Wolf of Wall Street."
3050,0,Even the energetic performance by the Brit actress Emily Blunt can't save this misfire.
3051,0,"Pain Hustlers tries really hard to build a hero, tear her down, and then rehabilitate her status, but to what end? The film ends up using the fentanyl crisis as a narrative drive, a highly dubious move when you're supposed to be spreading awareness."
3052,0,"Pain Hustlers not only needs a higher dosage of fresh ideas, but a new prescription altogether."
3053,1,"The tone swings hectically between drama and comedy, as though the film is in two minds about being  satire or drama. Still, the whole thing is nicely anchored by Blunt, who puts in a sterling performance with a very convincing heartland American accent."
3054,0,"A somewhat superfluous film, that evades convention and fails to find relevance.  [Full review in Spanish]"
3055,0,"In a bizarre narrative choice, it is the pharmaceutical rep with a heart of gold that gets to be the centre of a film about the opioid crisis, while the very real people who lost their life because of addiction seem like an afterthought."
3056,0,"Pain Hustlers struggles, in multiple ways, to be effective and leaves us with the feeling that the makers weren’t on the right side of the slant they ran with. It was too frivolously handled and it wasn’t clear what message it intended to get across."
3057,0,"There is some snappy editing here and a handful of lively directing choices that threaten to push the film into more inspired territory, but it’s not enough to overwhelm the workmanlike, by-the-numbers construction of the rest of the project."
3058,0,It leaves you questioning the actual message the film intends to convey.
3059,1,"Like so many movies of its kind, Pain Hustlers gets too wrapped up in the thrills of the grift to service its ultimate indictment of drug companies and their questionable practices."
3060,0,"Shorter and sweeter explainers of pharmaceutical sales and marketing to doctors exist in droves. It may well be that Yates and his filmmaking team knew all this going in, and decided to sleepwalk their way through the process. It certainly feels that way."
3061,0,"Pain Hustlers feels like a retreading of the same ground covered in other recent works, bringing nothing especially new to the table and, in splitting the stylistic difference between slick/breezy and poignant/authentic, succeeding fully at neither."
3062,1,"It's plenty entertaining, but not particularly thoughtful — just enough depth to fill a prescription pad, not a whole book."
3063,0,"Emily Blunt is one of our greatest actors, but Pain Hustlers feels overlong, dull and and ultimately misses its mark."
3064,0,"A trope and unoriginal. It is not so much an homage but a knockoff of better films and series that have come before it. It’s all flash with false promises, little substance, and harmful for you."
3065,1,"…by framing an upbeat, feel-good story against a real human catastrophe, Yates blunts his own message, and it’s fair to complain that the well-meaning but overtly fabricated Pain Hustlers somehow ends up letting the bad guys off the hook once again…"
3066,1,"A mixed bag for me, but any excuse to watch Blunt pull off a character like Liza makes it mostly worth watching."
3067,0,A movie that looks like it is about something important but lacking the insight to get there.
3068,0,"“Pain Hustlers” has a buzz, here and there. But the story and these characters never really get their hooks in us as Yates leans on the sentimental, takes us to an indifferent climax, and then throws in a couple of anti-climaxes to boot."
3069,0,"A movie about the people who enabled America’s opioid crisis shouldn’t have the look and feel of a Pitbull music video, but there you have it."
3070,1,"Emily Blunt radiates with her magnetic and engaging performance as Liza Drake [and] pairs well with Chris Evans, who does a good job playing a fast-talking sales rep."
3071,0,"Misses the mark on tone, style and pace. We've seen this story before, but better executed and with better results. [Full review in Spanish]"
3072,0,"If Scorsese hadn’t done it first, then this style wouldn’t have come to the mind of Yates. It’s unfair to compare films and filmmakers, but when the style is so blatantly copied it feels unoriginal."
3073,0,"It gives us little tossed-off jokes that go splat, moribund third-act sentimentalism, a slick veneer to gloss over its tonal deficiencies and a protagonist who needs more depth and crisper definition along the edges instead of rudimentary Screenplay 101."
3074,0,"It's starts off strong, the first 40 minutes or so, but then it becomes trite and repetitive and you get bored with the whole story. It has fantastic actors, Emily Blunt and Andy Garcia, but they can only do so much with a lackluster script."
3075,1,"Pain Hustlers is both watchable and eye-opening, even though its dramatic impulses do kind of cancel each other out."
3076,0,"Netflix's Painkillers and their latest, Pain Hustlers, are vapid entries that don't have anything to add to the conversation."
3077,0,"Essentially, 'Pain Hustlers' realization isn’t as eye-opening as it should be – considering there are other films and series that have told the same story."
3078,0,"It aims to be a Wolf of Wall Street for the opioid crisis, but ultimately just ends up an entertaining, but empty, watch."
3079,0,"While the top half of Pain Hustlers is illuminating, the story falters by trying to make the lead character sympathetic."
3080,0,"Pain Husters manages to avoid feeling like an Adam McKay remake of Dopesick, but its shifting tone never quite hits the right notes."
3081,0,What begins as a fresh film with a certain dynamism gradually becomes a discreet attempt to milk the most emotional side of everything related to the opioid crisis. [Full review in Spanish]
3082,0,"Pain Hustlers tries too hard to be compelling, failing to highlight the raw talents within its grasp and the detail that leaning into the emotional crux of the characters could’ve made it better."
3083,0,I don’t really know what Pain Hustlers wants to do.
3084,0,"Pain Hustlers is one of the most predictable, uninteresting, and boring movies of the year."
3085,0,"Emily Blunt anchors Pain Hustlers often over-the-top antics with ample humanity, but the formulaic execution and uneven tone is a bitter pill."
3086,0,"Emily Blunt is so emotionally present that she almost redeems the movie. She doesn’t, but she at least makes the first half of “Pain Hustlers” watchable."
3087,0,"There is no guts to Pain Hustlers’ try-hard gonzo-ness, resulting in a sub-Scorsese style that both underlines and loses its point."
3088,0,What it comes down to is several movies share the same type of storytelling and premise but are presented more engagingly and memorably than Pain Hustlers.
3089,0,[T]he human toll of the crisis at its core seems like an afterthought to the filmmakers.
3090,1,“Pain Hustlers” is Liza’s story to tell and Blunt finds a way to bring her to life and connect us with her.
3091,0,"Yates is unwilling to create a grittier understanding of self-preservation and psychological detachment, giving the wholly reprehensible world of pharmaceutical profiteering the Disney treatment."
3092,0,You’d have to be on drugs to enjoy it.
3093,1,"The movie is constrained by its own conscience, thriving when Evans’s marvelously feral Pete is unleashed to dress like a Lonafen spray and rap about sales commissions, only to pivot apologetically from corporate bacchanals to suffering victims."
3094,0,"Pain Hustlers is flashy and annoyingly bereft of any complexity. Yates and his collaborators are wading in the kiddie pool with brightly coloured floaties and even then, they’ve gone way beyond their depth."
3095,1,David Yates‘ occasionally comedic crime drama is mostly fast paced and always fast talking
3096,0,"It’s hard to extend much credit for the subject matter when it’s exploited for a “wild ride” that isn’t even wild, hawking a true story that isn’t even true."
3097,0,The excitement that the film tries to generate for its main characters is disturbingly glib.
3098,0,"In the end, the movie acts much like its characters: It diverts the viewer’s attention with gaudy visuals and melodramatic plot points instead of ever coming close to telling a single uncomfortable truth."
3099,0,"It does want you to feel horrible about the loss of life while presenting it through the filter of a warped, irony-saturated Horatio Alger story, however, and that’s where the wild ride of it all gets too bumpy for its own good."
3100,0,"Pain Hustlers fulfills the basic requirement of explaining the harrowing true story effectively, but given its star leads and skillful director at the helm, it could have and probably should have been much better."
3101,1,"Pain Hustlers could have used more depth and originality than it has, but it still deserves credit for shining a light on a problem that’s only gotten worse since the time depicted in the film."
3102,0,Flush this prescription down the toilet.
3103,0,Some decent performances and an interesting topic can't prevent the overdose of clichés
3104,0,Pain Hustlers is a well-acted and watchable but all too familiar drama. It's a picture of a picture.
3105,0,Needing to follow a protagonist whose sympathies the film can leverage at any point blunts whatever judgment it wants to cast on its characters—and the broader history it’s trying to depict.
3106,0,"The screenplay hopscotches all over and the film wastes a great slimy performance from Evans and a decent, if unremarkable, one from the normally terrific Blunt."
3107,0,Pain Hustlers badly wants what The Wolf of Wall Street has but has no spine or bite to get there
3108,1,"Boosted by the efforts of a top notch cast and some clever plotting, Pain Hustlers continually walks a fine line between good taste and bad, but thankfully it comes out mostly ahead in the end."
3109,0,"It offers the bones of a compelling story, but one-note characters, riskless storytelling and creaky pacing prevent this film from making an impact. This is a prescription best left unfilled."
3110,0,"... While Pain Hustlers achieves a few ruthless and powerful scenes, as a whole it ends up being quite unsuccessful and disappointing due to its superficiality and lack of subtlety. [Full review in Spanish]"
3111,1,David Yates directs a story that entertains and provokes deep reflection on the human consequences of corporate greed. [Full review in Spanish]
3112,0,The film takes no creative risks while leaning into all the cliches. There’s just nothing new here.
3113,0,A shallow true-crime comedy struggling to bust out of the staid drama it becomes.
3114,0,"Pain Hustlers is a rehash of a rehash. It isn’t even leftovers, it is congealed, cheese-flavored goo someone dared called “macaroni and cheese”."
3115,1,It’s predictable but glossily watchable.
3116,1,"Blunt is on fire, co-star Chris Evans is serviceable, and Andy Garcia is a hoot as the imperious, eccentric, billionaire boss."
3117,0,A well-acted and initially gripping story that loses momentum about halfway through and undergoes severe and often implausible shifts in tone.
3118,0,"Pain Hustlers waits until very late in the game to really drive home the horrors behind the opioid epidemic. For too long we’re complicit with its characters. And maybe that’s what it’s going for; but if so, it leaves an unpleasant aftertaste."
3119,1,"A real-life story with social issues about capitalism that is entertaining and funny while it makes you think, without being too earnest and serious."
3120,0,"Blunt mostly rises above the mediocre material, and Chris Evans continues his post-MCU hot streak of lacklustre projects."
3121,0,"Pain Hustlers is a waste of great actors and an interesting premise that's unfortunately been exhausted by other more worthwhile documentaries and fictional portrayals that have come before it. Chaotically-paced, predictable, dirty, and unfunny."
3122,1,"Pain Hustlers manages to be lively and moving, while also illuminating exactly how broken the American health care system is and how all of us are caught in its claws."
3123,0,"To Yates's credit, Pain Hustlers moves nicely, paced like Scorsese's relentless The Wolf of Wall Street, but nearly an hour shorter. It doesn't outstay its welcome, but neither does it challenge its audience."
3124,1,"Formulaic Netflix fare. Blunt and Evans are both having a lot of fun. Yates has nothing of value new to say about the opioid crisis, it feels too long and lacks bite, but it's still highly entertaining because of its high energy."
3125,1,Pain Hustlers is a fleeting funhouse of club jams and over-the-top blazers. It is a horrendously good time for a film meant to tackle big pharma's deadly neglect during the opioid epidemic.
3126,0,"A dramatically conflicted film that lacks energy and momentum, Pain Hustlers is a rote fictionalization of a real investigation into America’s opioid crisis. The characters it concocts feel like the products of too many rewrites."
3127,0,Pain Hustlers is attempting to create an actual dichotomy of heroes and villains in the world of scummy pharmaceutical reps without ever acknowledging the character’s willful blindness to the effects of pushing a highly potent narcotic on the public.
3128,0,"[Yates'] filmic language never offers quite enough sex, quite enough excess, quite enough of capitalism’s depravity. “Pain Hustlers” just doesn’t know how to commit."
3129,0,Pain Hustlers is a mixed bag of entertainment that opts for flashiness instead of focusing on the important elements of the story at hand.
3130,0,"The overall production value may be showy, but the polish quickly fades to reveal a consistently dull experience."
3131,0,Chris Evans & Emily Blunt try their damnedest but cannot shake off the feeling that they are merely cosplaying as evil execs.
3132,0,“Pain Hustlers” entertains thanks to its strong leads but it’s hard not to find it a derivative look at a tough topic that relies on tropes from far superior movies.
3133,0,"Blunt’s performance is the main selling point in a largely ineffectual satire. In the opioid-movie space, Pain Hustlers does more pharm than good."
3134,1,"Emily Blunt delivers a fantastic performance as a woman who, despite her irresponsible actions, still makes us root for her to correct her actions, even if it’s too late."
3135,0,"A slick but hollow movie that pales next to two recently, similarly themed limited series."
3136,0,"And while Pain Hustlers is a perfectly fine title, the film probably should have been called Liza Drake, the name of the sales rep played by Emily Blunt, who single-handedly almost saves this tone-deaf drama from itself."
3137,0,"At its best, the film is just a nice time spent watching Emily Blunt and Chris Evans being great on screen. At worst, this is a prescription for an uninspiring and even dull experience."
3138,1,A seductive thriller that meticulously explores corporate greed and gender politics.
3139,1,"A great surprise...It has the feel of a lost erotic thriller from the 80s or 90s, and yet, the story is given modern sensibilities."
3140,1,"Fair Play is a thorny, gnarly, tangled web that’s woven by Domont’s deft hands."
3141,1,"Fair Play features two phenomenal and emotional performances at the center, and there is an intensity that will have viewers locked in until the end."
3142,1,"Domont creates a story to not only expose how deep-seated patriarchal norms are in corporate culture, but to also honestly portray how its victims will often attempt to believe those hurting them most are still worth saving."
3143,0,"An off-putting exercise in workplace intrigue, full of slick surfaces, performative smoking, and people horndogging in suspiciously forceful ways."
3144,1,"Avoiding the restrictions of a standard erotic thriller, this brutal drama expertly and equally explores the explosive passions of its two characters in a truthful, vivid, and unflinching way."
3145,1,"First-time feature director Chloe Domont knows how to draw the audience in. The way she builds tension with the most minimal devices, utilizing the already-strained dynamics of a hedge fund company and a rich arsenal of quips, is immensely pleasurable."
3146,1,A provocative thriller that explores the gender dynamics in today's world. [Full Review in Spanish]
3147,1,...a solid drama that benefits substantially from the top-tier efforts of its stars...
3148,1,"Regardless of how you feel about stock market films, this exceptionally well-acted relationship thriller is guaranteed to entertain, even if it will ruin Alden Ehrenreich for you (because he's so hissably awful)"
3149,1,"The dedicated performances from Phoebe Dyvenor and Alden Ehrenreich make it a gripping viewing experience, emphasizing the film's thought-provoking messages about gender politics and seeking equal recognition based on merit rather than gender."
3150,0,"Writer-director Chloe Domont engulfs us in a world of awfulness, and leaves us, and her characters, there to wallow in it. ... It’s like trying to care about the result of a game in a sport for which you have zero interest."
3151,0,Wants to take a giant leap forward to get to its chief beef but that swiftness strains credulity with co-workers oblivious to the central relationship until taking another hard turn into what is possibly supposed to be satirical carnage that doesn't land.
3152,0,"It touches a nerve with topics such as abusive corporation treatment and sexual harassment. However, it falls short of realizing its full potential, with a conclusion that doesn't quite measure up to the rest of the narrative."
3153,1,Excels at tugging one strand of a rug and yanking the entire thing out from under two people who thought they could handle anything.
3154,1,"The risk in the screenplay involves getting ahead at the office. All of the film’s acting is superb. The extraordinary performances from Dynevor and Ehrenreich are electrifying. If Academy Award voters are brave, acting nominations are deserved."
3155,0,"This is one of those movies where the thematics undermine the characters, where everyone just seem to be a piece on the chessboard."
3156,0,"Initially it works, and then it devolves into something so extreme that it becomes borderline silly."
3157,1,"After carefully steering it to within touching distance of David Fincher’s Gone Girl — the pinnacle of this sort of cinema, at least in the last decade  — Domont appears to have a change of heart as she swerves towards a ‘safer’, more conventional ending."
3158,1,"While Chloe Domont’s debut feature overcooks things in its final throes, it leaves us with some meat to chew on."
3159,1,"Watching Fair Play sometimes feels like observing a slow-motion traffic accident, but it gets at enduring conflicts between men and women in ways that few movies have."
3160,1,"... Perversion, desire, and pleasure come together like an explosive combo, which the director handles deftly. [Full review in Spanish]"
3161,1,"A film with a distinctive personality and an eagerness to dig around in the real-world sandbox and ask questions for which it knows there is no single, pat set of answers. Fair Play never stops making moves, which makes even its missteps feel refreshing."
3162,1,Anchored by strong work from Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich it is hard not to be drawn into Fair Play -- even as the film becomes more and more uncomfortable to watch.
3163,1,"A riveting exposition on sexism, ego and gender wrapped up in a taught and intelligent office thriller."
3164,1,It's one of the more incisive and powerfully made movies about relationship dynamics in a good long while.
3165,1,"Straining for credulity in the tough, fast-moving world of financial services, the film's appealing young romantic couple each have a point to make in the power-play, in this good-looking but oddly even-handed thriller"
3166,1,"Fair Play has a lot to say, and the semi-autobiographical nature of the script (by director, Chloe Dumont) is evident with plenty of post-screening discussion points. Unfortunately, it falls flat in the third act."
3167,0,"It isn’t that it goes in a different direction from what we’d hoped that gives us hesitation in recommending it, however, but, instead, it’s its over-the-top final act that doesn’t track with what comes before it."
3168,1,"A steamy tale of smoldering jealousy in the brutal world of high finance...brought to white-hot life by bravura performances by Dynevor and Ehrenreich, and a coolly calculated turn by Marsan."
3169,0,"What Fair Play can’t quite deliver is the nuance needed to make these comparisons between men and women unique or new, and to push itself past archetypes and parables."
3170,1,Perversely provocative and shamelessly entertaining.
3171,1,"A compelling, astute and brilliantly acted tale of how modern relationships can still be warped and wiped away by traditions in the workplace."
3172,1,"Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich star in Chloe Domont's debut feature, a brilliant dissection of fragile masculinity with a promotion as a trigger. [Full review in Spanish]"
3173,0,"Oddly, as the story's tension rises, the film becomes less involving, abandoning wit and authenticity for arch melodrama."
3174,1,"Fair Play is combative, unpleasant, and absolutely brilliant."
3175,1,A powerhouse movie that should go to the top of your Netflix watch list.
3176,1,"There is certainly a lot to love in Fair Play, from Dynevor and Ehrenreich's chemistry to white-knuckle scenes of hedge fund intrigue. But the film can't fulfill its own ambitious attempts to interrogate the intersections of power, gender, and ego."
3177,1,"Great work from the two protagonists, an achieved atmosphere of tension, and good management of how everything deteriorates lead to the perfect ending. [Full review in Spanish]"
3178,1,"Fair Play is, essentially, an intense drama that some previous opinions classified as an erotic thriller, although it is legitimately decaffeinated in this subject... [Full review in Spanish]"
3179,1,Fair Play is the immersive and compelling story of a seemingly-unbreakable-partnership-turned-toxic that you won’t easily forget.
3180,1,A sizzling directorial debut from Chloe Domont with career defining performances from Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenrich.
3181,1,"Luke might not mind a bit of period sex, but seeing his fiancé as his professional superior? Now that’s a boner-killer."
3182,1,Both [Phoebe] Dynevor and [Alden] Ehrenreich share great chemistry and their love-hate relationship is part of the reasons that made Fair Play such a thought-provoking experience.
3183,1,"Destined to court controversy, screenwriter/director Chloe Domont's adult -entangling, insightful view of gender dynamics is a compelling psychological thriller for the post-#MeToo era, as she imbues the ensuing histrionics with a veil of validity."
3184,0,The characters created by Dynevor and Ehrenreich are bland and boring.
3185,1,"It’s hard to combine sex, danger, and stars with erotic chemistry. But just when you wonder if anyone can reach the zenith of the 80s and 90s and create a new BODY HEAT or BASIC INSTINCT, along comes FAIR PLAY and it truly thrills."
3186,1,Fair Play transcends its shortcomings and becomes one of the most thrilling directorial debuts this year.
3187,1,Fair Play uses elements of thrillers and melodrama that function like a pot that is heated to its boiling point. [Full review in Spanish]
3188,1,"Fair Play is a far cry from 9 to 5; it fearlessly updates the male-female workplace power dynamic to modern standards, which is to say, it paints a portrait of male toxicity that pushes past amorality to near-fatality. And it’s riveting."
3189,1,"While the story arc is obvious and predictable, the tone of the narrative is complemented nicely by the cinematography and lighting, maintaining the turbulent agitation as emotions flare."
3190,1,"It's a ""relationship thriller"" because you don't know exactly where it's gonna go, the tension is always there, and you can see it in how they [the main characters] look at each other..and there is so much under the surface."
3191,1,"In a high-stakes environment, the egos on display are heightened here, setting up shifting dynamics, and sinister overtones. That explosive tension forces this off the rails in the third act, going from uncomfortable to painful as it strains credibility."
3192,1,Exceptional performances keep you glued to the evolving relationship.
3193,1,"Fair Play is a spectacular drama, a painful crash of broken love and a sharp look at the fragility of the male ego in the business world."
3194,1,"Fair Play is a film with tonal shifts that aren’t always executed well. That said, once it finds its footing it’s a stark and uncomfortable look at a deteriorating relationship that races toward an unhinged uncertainty that pays tension off."
3195,1,"An uncomfortable yet engrossing watch, this is an astonishingly tight debut from Domont."
3196,1,"An impressive feature debut from Chloe Domont, her shrewd script & assured direction make for a tense + twisted corporate thriller that makes your skin crawl."
3197,1,"With star-making performances by Alden Ehrenreich and Phoebe Dynevor, this movie is not messing around, which makes it one of the best Netflix releases of the year."
3198,1,https://kkfi.org/program-episodes/freeze-frame-the-exorcist-believer-r-fair-play-r-the-royal-hotel-r-totally-killer-r/
3199,1,"Benefitting from intimate cinematography and committed performances, the film paints gutsy and psychologically plausible portraits of a toxic workplace and an increasingly twisted relationship."
3200,1,"Domont carefully crafts a cautionary tale of male fragility with powerhouse performances by Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich which propel the erotic thriller into the stratosphere. As gender roles are redefined, Domont takes us to a shocking climax."
3201,1,Not even the habitual and confusing banking language can calm down this intelligent erotic thriller about gender politics and high finance Darwinism.  [Full review in Spanish]
3202,0,"Like the riskiest stocks on the market, Fair Play dips and rallies in patterns I could never truly pin down. Just when it appears to be trending upward, it plummets even lower."
3203,1,"It’s ultimately a very ugly film. That’s not its failure, but its intention."
3204,0,"hough the film constantly seems poised to deliver something insightful, it never finds any depth, thus leaving the viewer with frustratingly little to care about. In the end, it just feels like one long tease."
3205,1,"At its best, Fair Play feels like a demented game where everything in high finance comes down to how you project yourself, man or woman."
3206,1,"As verbal wounds escalate into literal bruises, we realize Domont has tricked us to invest our own empathy in these two emotionally bankrupt young lovers who can accept volatility in the stock market — but not in themselves."
3207,1,"While well shot and cleverly conceived in its early goings by writer/director Chloe Domont, I feel like Fair Play spins its wheels moreso than just ramps up the tension."
3208,1,"Not only must credit be given for how well-written the characters are and the crispness of the dialogue, but also the work of the two leads.  Ehrenreich is one of our most underrated screen actors, while Dynevor is a revelation."
3209,1,"Fair Play is an effective, if slightly overlong, acidic relationship drama, a kind of Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? set among the world of high finance and insecure men."
3210,1,"Great productions elements to it with the score, cinematography, great directorial debut and strong performances especially from Phoebe but the lack of relationship building to get to where they end up should’ve been more of the focus to start."
3211,1,"While it didn’t work for me, ultimately, I do hope it does well so that people might be allowed to make good thrillers again."
3212,1,"A bum ending doesn’t deflate the endeavor, which examines psychological poisoning brilliantly, working right to the core of humiliation."
3213,1,"Tense, at times perverse, but above all intelligent and bold, this first feature film by Chloe Domont positions her as a filmmaker to follow closely... [Full review in Spanish]"
3214,0,The two characters are so unlikable you just don’t care how any of it turns out.
3215,1,"It’s a sharp, cruel movie that’s hard to “recommend” in some respects, but it sure does leave a lacerating impression."
3216,1,"Fair Play shows a clear willingness to portray the sexual desire of its lead characters as well as how their career paths can set them at war with each other. As the film continues, it asks some deep and dark questions."
3217,1,"With sly effectiveness in hanging on every stare between the words, that’s how a movie like ""Fair Play"" gets you."
3218,1,"This workplace psycho-romance traces the resentments that can asphyxiate a couple when one partner’s career escalates as the other’s falters, and it does so in the service of a bigger picture."
3219,1,"Sizzling, relevant, and smart filmmaking which acts as a hell of a cinematic calling card for Domont."
3220,1,"Fair Play is for the most part a smart, modern update to those wince-inducing erotic office thrillers from the Nineties starring Demi Moore, Michael Douglas and a floppy disc."
3221,1,The cast is riveting and the insights into the poisonous priorities of people who know the cost of everything and the value of nothing at all paint a picture of modern corporate treachery.
3222,1,One of the shrewdest takes on the erotic thriller in recent memory.
3223,1,"Fair Play is a tantalising, seductive drama that never aims to be blatantly feminist, but a film with a more broad appeal – and that is a compliment."
3224,1,"It’s maliciously effective, up to a point: an enjoyably lurid piece of classy-trashy psychological warfare."
3225,1,"“Fair Play” is the edgiest, coolest, sexiest and most provocative film of the year!  Don't miss it!"
3226,1,"For those still experiencing ""Succession"" withdrawal or who are anxiously awaiting the third season of HBO's ""Industry,"" ""Fair Play"" is a more than satisfactory fix."
3227,1,"A tough Dynevor from Netflix's ""Bridgerton, and the credible Ehrenreich, following his underrated supporting turn in ""Oppenheimer,"" strut their surprising stuff like seasoned old pros."
3228,1,"Fair Play is a hauntingly realistic depiction of toxic masculinity and sexual politics centered within the cutthroat and challenging world of high finance. Phoebe Dynevor and Alden Ehrenreich expertly portray their complex, dynamic characters."
3229,1,"A searing, nicely sordid psychosexual thriller in the world of high finance..."
3230,1,"Fair Play is a smart, twisty mix of romance and corporate politics."
3231,1,Sometimes you are not prepared for what a film has to deliver. This is exactly the feeling with this erotic thriller that gives you a firm slap around the face in the first scene to get you enthralled.
3232,1,It begins with the blood of a woman and ends with the blood of a man. But it’s what transpires between that proves most captivating in Chloe Domont’s auspicious filmmaking debut.
3233,1,"Fair Play may represent a worst-case scenario for its unfortunate couple, but its searing observations about fragility and the male ego don’t feel too far off from reality."
3234,1,"Domont resists turning her film into a series of juicy and meaningless sex scenes, preferring to use them as a smart, psychologically complex status bar for the central couple."
3235,1,Fair Play really does manage to play fair in terms of balancing our antipathy with our voyeuristic interest in what’s happening.
3236,1,"The film has a propulsion to it that keeps it interesting, and the intensity of the final sequence is sufficient to forgive any earlier missteps."
3237,1,When a hedge fund promotes a she (Phoebe Dynevor) over a he (Alden Ehrenreich)—they’re engaged— gender politics becomes a powerhouse erotic thriller which newbie filmmaker Chloe Domont wants couples to leave arguing like hell. No worries. They  will.
3238,0,"And yet, for a film about a man engaging in precarious subterfuge among deep-jungle guerilla traffickers, it’s weirdly boring, its tension and intensity diluted by cornball overtures... and Caviezel’s long, slow, brooding stares."
3239,0,"Monteverde's visual elegance is undermined by a script full of unnecessary clarifications, and underlinings. [Full review in Spanish]"
3240,1,"It is a good, compelling story, but is it true? After a lot of fact-checking, I found out much of the story is not true, and the hero is significantly different in reality than the way he is depicted in the movie. The stink of QAnon pervades this movie."
3241,1,Alejandro Monteverde directs a film with a solid narrative and elegant staging. [Full review in Spanish]
3242,1,"""Sound of Freedom"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that is both socially relevant and artistically impressive."
3243,0,"As it turns out, Sound of Freedom is all bark, but it has no bite. Despite raising awareness on a difficult, but important subject matter, Sound of Freedom becomes a victim of its own lack of ambition."
3244,0,"... if we're honest, the movie is particularly mediocre or perhaps even bad, or very bad, depending on your mood (and beliefs). [Full review in Spanish]"
3245,0,"If this flick wasn’t being used as a battleground in the Great Culture War this week, I’d forget I ever saw it within six months."
3246,0,Sound of Freedom's over dramatic approach and conservative vibe when it comes to dealing with such a tough subject matter keep it from being taken as more than a flimsy based on true events search and rescue story.
3247,0,"A deeply unappealing mixture of the sleazy and the self-righteous, the film isn’t exploitative in the generic shoot-’em-up manner of a Liam Neeson vigilante pic — it’s too pious for action."
3248,1,It’s refreshingly unaffected. The storytelling is routine. It warrants neither its hard-core disciples nor its worst enemies. Ignore the dishonest huffing and puffing.
3249,0,"By being so focused on the Message, they leave out any other aspect that might have served the film. The irony of all this is that if they had made a good movie, their precious Message would have been transmitted better. Full review in Spanish."
3250,0,"A thunderously crass and manipulative movie that is hampered by erratic pacing, pantomime bad guys and an overfondness for shots of Caviezel weeping God-fearing, manly tears."
3251,1,Jim Caviezel is a one-man scourge of child predators in this well-meaning thriller that doesn’t entirely deserve to be written off as culture-war propaganda.
3252,0,"It’s bizarre, unsettling and yet – in the filmmaking equivalent of turning wine to water – bracingly dull to boot."
3253,0,Ballard is the infallible risen Christ who can never do wrong. [Full review in Spanish]
3254,1,The call-for-action message is definitively more important than the final result. [Full review in Spanish]
3255,0,"If Sound of Freedom blows your mind, it may be down more to the disorientating lack of a dramatic arc than learning what the MSM apparently don’t want you to know."
3256,1,Simply shut off all the noise about this film and go and see an entertaining film with a powerful message.
3257,0,"Strictly cinematically speaking, Sound of Freedom is mediocre... [Full review in Spanish]"
3258,0,This is just a dull and badly acted movie.
3259,1,It’s worth a look because it’s a well-made example of a thriller inspired by unspeakable crimes that are being committed the world over.
3260,0,There is too much going wrong on the creative front to hold your attention for two long hours.
3261,0,"Though slickly made and never too openly lurid, at its core this is the simplest kind of exploitation movie, in which a stance of righteous indignation supplies an alibi for a fascination with hidden evil, linked in turn with a fear of corrupt foreigners."
3262,1,The film-making is occasionally a bit clunky and obvious – but director Alejandro Monteverde (Bella) is clearly getting the most out of a modest budget.
3263,1,"It’s almost disappointing that the bluster over it being an incendiary, faith-based film pushing a right-wing agenda and championing Qanon agit-prop turns out to be baseless. In actuality, the film unfurls as a fairly standard, well-directed thriller."
3264,0,"Taking its reputation out of the equation, Sound of Freedom, when all is said and done, is a decidedly average, overtly melodramatic, emotionally manipulative drama"
3265,1,"Despite all the attendant hype and noise, Sound Of Freedom is a solid second-tier thriller…nothing more, nothing less."
3266,0,"The conflict and intrigue coursing through Sound of Freedom is not all that different from standard suspense-thriller fare, with overwrought asides in the film’s dialogue to remind viewers..."
3267,1,"The movie’s a bit of a slow-burn, with most of the energy dedicated to physically locating where the traffickers, and the children they’re trafficking, actually are."
3268,0,The bottom line is Sound of Freedom is no more compelling than an episode of a television series such as Criminal Minds. The acting is passable and the pacing laborious at times.
3269,1,God's children are not for sale. Spread the word.
3270,1,Say what you will about the movie. In the end it rises above the dubious claims and disingenuous concerns to offer a compelling and at times unflinching exposé that will stick with you for a long time.
3271,1,An intense and soul wrenching thriller that explores one man’s calling to confront the evil scourge of child trafficking.
3272,1,"Seeing the film, weeks after its release, the biggest surprise for me was that it is not remotely religious or political. There is nothing right wing about caring about trafficked kids."
3273,1,There’s a good reason why this film has managed to carve out significant space in the summer box office marketplace – it’s effective.
3274,0,"As a contribution to cinema, the movie comes up empty. [Full review in Spanish]"
3275,0,"A movie that amounts to little more than an overlong episode of Criminal Minds, and one that serves as a stalking horse to some very unsavory stuff."
3276,1,A competently crafted and acted dramatic thriller that effectively puts a spotlight on a tragic real-life issue. [Full Review in Spanish]
3277,0,"As for the losers, start with everyone who gave their money and two hours and 15 minutes of their life to a story that is at best embellished and, whether intentionally or by coincidence, profiting off conspiracy-fueled mass hysteria."
3278,1,You won’t come away BLOWN AWAY by the film itself but your jaw will drop and I feel many people will walk away emotional from that. There’s a lot of heartbreaking stuff you learn. It is a solid watch.
3279,0,The low-budget message indie has surprisingly become a box office hit for reasons I attribute to good marketing and not to being a good film.
3280,1,"A gripping, if maddeningly slow-paced, fact-inspired story."
3281,1,Sound of Freedom tells us about a reality we cannot ignore: trafficking in minors and child pornography exists worldwide. This feature film deserves all the attention just for daring to talk about such a critical issue [Full Review in Spanish]
3282,1,"Controversy and filmmaking flaws aside, Sound Of Freedom touches on an important subject that neither side should be politicizing."
3283,1,"But beyond some stereotypes, the film works for its realistic seasoning. [Full review in Spanish]"
3284,0,"A blandly competent thriller that finds an easy way into your feelings since it deals with child trafficking (a grave subject matter that has been tragically co-opted as a rallying cry for xenophobic, pro-Trump types)."
3285,0,Reducing what could have been a potent piece to self-aggrandizing propaganda with its heart in the right place...
3286,1,"But even as the film's pacing starts to thud... its work has been done, competently if not altogether artfully. Sometimes, obvious works just fine."
3287,1,"Some aspects of this film are ethically dubious, and its credibility has been debated, but there’s no denying that “Sound of Freedom” is impactful and dramatically effective."
3288,0,The movie has good intentions and the topic is heart-breaking but the film unfortunately can't keep up with the engaging 1st act. A great movie was in there somewhere but the script and sluggish pacing had me eager for the credits.
3289,1,"A powerful, tense thriller which manages to tackle sensitive subject matter without getting exploitive.  There are some pacing issues and the film would have been better 20 minutes shorter, but it's also one of the most impactful films of the year."
3290,1,It's an informative film that's a solid thriller in its own right.
3291,0,The narrative diffuses into an improbable “Heart of Darkness” style river journey. Only kind of dull.
3292,1,"Director Alejandro Monteverde beautifully weaves together a compelling story with captivating performances, led by Jim Caveizel. Think what you want about the man, but he perfectly slides into the role of Ballard, and delivers a passionate performance."
3293,0,No more informative than a horror film about the boogeyman. [Full review in Spanish]
3294,1,Not as political or religious as people are saying. It's a well-made thriller about an important topic. Nothing more but nothing less.
3295,1,"Despite there being a message for everyone, it will have its detractors. But by the time the credits roll and the facts and figures of this terrible epidemic are given, it's hard not to feel something - and that is great use of art."
3296,1,"Director Alejandro Monteverde establishes well-drawn good vs. evil battlelines and keeps it simple with basic storytelling elements during the 2-hour, 10-minute runtime, framing it as a wider-scope procedural, like an extended “Magnum P.I.” or “FBI.”"
3297,0,"While the cinematography and acting are all solid, the way the trafficked children are depicted is made to exploit our emotions, and the end credits explain why: To continue the Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) mission."
3298,1,"With a faith-based undertone, this is a powerful, disturbing thriller, inspired by true events."
3299,1,"Sound of Freedom is a heartbreaking yet beautiful film that shines a light on the horrors of human-trafficking. This is a necessary story, and while the dialogue doesn’t always land, the message is important."
3300,0,"To know thousands of adults will absorb Sound of Freedom, this vigilante fever dream, and come away thinking themselves better informed on a hidden civilizational crisis… well, it’s profoundly depressing. Worse still, they’ll want to spread the word."
3301,0,"A solemn, drawn-out bore."
3302,0,"The villainous characters are caritactures, but I didn’t buy virtually any of the performances. And the”Sound of Freedom’s” funereal pacing and struggling manipulations left me cold, when I was expecting big emotional moments that never came."
3303,1,Strikes the difficult balance between being entertained while telling an important true story on a subject that should be shouted from the rooftops. [Full review in Spanish]
3304,0,The polish only makes Sound of Freedom’s attempt to illustrate how a voguish cultural anxiety can be ameliorated if people would just be courageous enough to pursue it (or give money to those willing to pursue it) more insidious.
3305,1,"It’s heartfelt, informative, and inspiring."
3306,1,"Some of the dialogue is corny, and some of the acting is clunky, but the movie's intentions are in the right places. Sound of Freedom goes all-in with the tearjerking aspects of this drama about child sex-trafficking."
3307,0,"Loudly bangs the drum for its important message, worshipping its protagonist without any thoughtful characterization, doing little of note beyond moving performances from Lucás Ávila and Cristal Aparicio as traumatized, tightly-bonded siblings"
3308,1,"In a conventional pulp way, we’ve glimpsed the heart of darkness. We’ve seen something about our world that makes the desire to “take action” seem more than an action-movie gesture."
3309,1,Sound of Freedom will inspire you to take action and do some good yourself
3310,1,"[C]o-writer/director Alejandro Monteverde's thriller works at doing exactly what it sets out to do. It is disturbing, yes, but also a hopeful call for something to be done..."
3311,1,Powerful performances highlight this stunning exposé on child trafficking.
3312,1,Sound of Freedom plays like an action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat at the same time as being a drama about Tim's first foray into rescuing trafficked kids. Caviezel's acting is spot on.
3313,1,An intense look at the scourge of child sex trafficking. Holds your interest but difficult to watch.
3314,1,"Sound of Freedom is a wake-up call, reminding Americans of the evil that’s perpetrated both inside and outside our borders."
3315,1,Sound of Freedom has an effective mix of anger and compassion. It really makes you think about the problem of child sex trafficking and how we can all work together to end it.
3316,1,"A triumph! Exhilarating! A powerful, heartfelt and gripping thriller."
3317,0,"It’s certainly a noble idea and a valuable reminder of humanity’s capacity for extraordinary malevolence. However, there’s a much better film to be made about this sensitive subject matter."
3318,1,Sound of Freedom is a suspenseful portrayal of the realities of human trafficking.
3319,1,"Beautifully shot and expertly crafted, there's plenty of excitement and tension, though the effort to get across a story and a message gives it an edge of docudrama."
3320,1,"To this day, How the Grinch Stole Christmas stands as one of the most inspired and truly magical holiday texts."
3321,0,With a little more polish and a lot more restraint this could have been a holiday treat. Instead it’s a repetitive and sometimes laborious exercise...
3322,1,"Gaspar Noe by means of Lars von Trier with John Waters, David Lynch, Harmony Korine, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Zombie, Darren Aronofsky, Uwe Boll, the Farrellys and Tim Story serving as creative consultants."
3323,0,It just doesn't work taking these short Seuss stories and turning them into a feature film. Very unpleasant to watchd
3324,0,I truly believe that Dr. Seuss defies adaptation and is best left in print and in the imaginations of all who read the stories.
3325,0,It's just an ugly piece of work.
3326,0,"Director Ron Howard aims for the beautifully stylized mayhem of Frank Tashlin and Tim Burton, but he comes closer to the clamorous, headache-inducing visual overkill of Joel Schumacher's Batman movies."
3327,1,"It's sweet enough for the very young, edgy enough for teens, and world/pop culture savvy enough for adults."
3328,0,The film is an act of love that doesn't quite transmit all of the passion it wishes it could. [Full Review in Spanish]
3329,0,A forgettable film in Ron Howard's repertoire. [Full Review in Spanish]
3330,0,"I just can't imagine the editor and director sitting down together, and THIS being the final product."
3331,0,"They really didn't have solid direction, they were just doing too much. That's coming from me, someone who routinely does too much."
3332,0,"Director Ron Howard usually lets his comedies gestate organically, but his Grinch is frantic from start to finish."
3333,0,"A fundamentally soulless, mercenary attack on soulless, mercenary things, and this ends up being deeply tedious and tiresome to watch, on pretty much every possible level."
3334,0,"The director, Ron Howard, is a grand old heartwarmer (Cocoon, etc.) but the heart of this picture is dead."
3335,0,"Such a departure from the book, it's not even Dr. Seuss."
3336,1,"Live-action version of classic has some crude, scary moments."
3337,0,"An unforgivable transgression from the usually reliable Ron Howard, ""Grinch"" boasts the visual polish of a Menards tree aisle and resembles not a cheerful Christmas, but rather what the bloodcurdling onset of a mescaline bender might feel like."
3338,0,"Howard and the rest of the crew do something the late Dr. Seuss never would: take chronological age over the youthful, innocent spirit that lingers untouched in everyone--and never goes out of style."
3339,0,"Five-year-olds might go for it, but people who grew up with Jones' version will be looking at their watches and grinding their teeth."
3340,0,"Cloying fancy gives way to gross-out comedy, twisted social commentary, affecting pathos, and weirdly sexualized romance in this lurid live-action version of the classic children's book."
3341,1,Parents can relax: Ron Howard's version of Dr. Seuss' tale of the Christmas-napping Grinch is a smartly stylized hoot.
3342,0,"Shrill, strenuous and entirely without charm."
3343,0,"The costumes astound, the sight gags abound, but the heart, oh the heart, now that must be found."
3344,0,"A jumbled mess, art-directed to within an inch of its life."
3345,0,"Unfortunately, Ron Howard is the Grinch who stole Christmas from Jim Carrey, Dr. Seuss, and the children who deserve a better story."
3346,0,
3347,1,"A holiday gift, The Grinch just may steal the hearts of kids and grown-ups alike."
3348,0,"Universal Pictures has definitely left something under your Christmas tree, but you might want to clean it up soon before it leaves a permanent stain."
3349,0,"In adding material, The Grinch loses much of its rhythm and the heart within it shrinks three sizes right along with it."
3350,0,How the Grinch Stole Christmas is thick with irony but doesn't have the guts to explore any of it.
3351,1,"If God is in the details, then this is the most righteous movie ever made.Jim Carrey is the only man deserving to interpret Chuck Jones' animation."
3352,1,"It's funny, it's sincere and it's gloriously bizarre."
3353,1,This delightful fantasy offers Happy Who-lidays to the young and the young at heart.
3354,1,"Carrey is superb, swamped in makeup and sounding like a cross between Hitchcock and The Honey Monster."
3355,1,Howard and his writers have made some interesting choices in bringing one of the most well-known American Christmas cartoons to life on the big screen.
3356,0,"The story’s message has always been that Christmas isn’t about baubles and trinkets or Santa and trees, it’s about celebration and joy. The problem is that the film collapses under the sheer weight of Carrey’s performance and the additional story elements"
3357,1,"Colourful adaptation of the children's classic by Dr Seuss, redeemed by a combination of Jim Carrey's manic performance, the sets and the make-up."
3358,0,You may feel like he stole 2 hours instead of Xmas and you'll want them back.
3359,1,Director Ron Howard's movie version of the popular Dr. Seuss classic creates a world of wonder and enchantment for kids of all ages. I found myself captivated by everything about it.
3360,0,"A shockingly noisy, ugly film."
3361,0,"""We'll slow down the pace and add flashback scenes, ""To the time when the Grinch was less furry, less green. ""We'll beef up the part of little Cindy Lou Who, ""Throw in lots of slapstick and sentiment, too."
3362,0,So the true meaning of Christmas and the simplicity of Dr. Seuss' classic holiday message were exploited by the crass commericialism of Universal Pictures. Did we really expect anything different?
3363,0,By the time that you read this short essay of ours / The Grinch will have made ten squintillion more dollars!
3364,1,How the Grinch stole Christmas is one kind of larceny. How Jim Carrey steals the picture is another matter entirely.
3365,0,"Other than some pretty good set design and special effects, there was nothing new of value in this version."
3366,0,
3367,1,"Definitely worth adding to the Christmas movie pantheon, but not at the expense of the original."
3368,0,Watching it approaches the disturbing position of being bedside as a loved one expires from a terminal disease.
3369,1,
3370,0,"We should probably be grateful that The Grinch is merely flawed and mediocre, not the flat-out disaster it could have been."
3371,1,Truly crowd pleasin' and Carrey's the reason.
3372,0,Perhaps 20 minutes too long and subject to torpor.
3373,0,"Less entertaining, less enlightening and less educational than either the book or the video."
3374,1,"This very funny, visually stunning film is a delight from start to finish."
3375,1,Howard has certainly nailed the playfully eccentric other world of Whoville.
3376,0,"For tales that require some edge, it is safe to deduce that Ron Howard is no match for the great Dr. Seuss."
3377,0,"The movie feels like it is perpetually in conflict, torn between its desire to be both a light-hearted fable and a dark black comedy."
3378,0,...severely (and unwittingly) alters the very source material beyond a point of explanation.
3379,0,One of the ugliest movies ever perpetrated on a mass audience.
3380,1,
3381,0,"A movie with good set and costume design, and very little else."
3382,0,Should be more heartfelt and touching than it is.
3383,0,"Anthony Hopkins was chosen to narrate the film, perhaps to recall the English accent of Boris Karloff from the vastly superior original animation, a move the filmmakers should have avoided."
3384,0,It is impossible to watch Grinch and not think wistfully of that magical moment in the TV special.
3385,1,A wonderfully funny movie with all the best that Jim Carrey has to give.
3386,1,"It's the rare holiday movie that manages to entertain the kid in all of us, without forgetting that grownups love the Grinch, too."
3387,1,"Carrey, with another ground-breaking performance, single-handedly elevates it to something much better."
3388,1,Generally delightful live-action adaptation of the children's classic.
3389,0,Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot. But Director Ron Who-ward saw gold in a pot.
3390,1,[It] could have certainly benefited from a little more of that mischievous nature.
3391,1,"Shows respect for the words and images of the book, and the wonderful 1966 animated classic."
3392,1,"If you have little moviegoers around for the holidays, you should still make the trip to Whovillie."
3393,1,"It's Christmas, for Grinch's sake; better to overdo it than be sacrilegious and not."
3394,1,Sure to earn a berth among the perennial Christmas film classics.
3395,1,Any tale that critiques the over-the-top commercialism of our society is right on track.
3396,0,"Grinchy-poo, you used to be a mean one... now you're just a goof. Sigh."
3397,0,The movie seems content to operate without a soul.
3398,0,What they forgot to budget for was heart.
3399,1,This Grinch isn't so bad. It's quite merry. Very!
3400,1,"Believe it or not, the Critic loved The Grinch!"
3401,0,You won't need a heart two sizes too small to gnash your teeth at this Grinch.
3402,0,The problems with Grinch stem from the lackluster script.
3403,1,How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a holiday winner.
3404,1,It is closer to wonderful than it is to awful.
3405,1,Howard and company actually make the collision of Seuss' sing-song poetry and Carrey's smart-aleck asides and sniggering sense of humor work.
3406,1,"Actually pretty entertaining, even for grown-ups, once you get through the first 10."
3407,1,A cute and funny movie in its own right.
3408,1,A true timeless classic this film may not be; It's simply a package of holiday glee.
3409,0,It's not Christmas that's being stolen here. It's the spirit of Dr. Seuss.
3410,0,You've got a stinker that deserves to be locked away in the yuletide bomb shelter along with Scrooged and Santa Claus: The Movie.
3411,1,The main show here is Jim Carrey. And he does a frankly brilliant job.
3412,1,The result is a vulnerable and sympathetic performance that may be Carrey's best to date.
3413,1,Boasts comic punch.
3414,1,Michael Corenblith's busy production design provides plenty to look at.
3415,1,"At its center, it has Carrey, whose nasty, catty Grinch is a hoot and a half."
3416,1,So that is how a Grinch and a girl steal this movie -- through heart and emotion. And aren't we glad they did.
3417,0,"Se compone bastante y puede llegar a ser conmovedora, pero el inicio no le ayuda"
3418,1,"In reviewing this movie it all comes down to one thing: When the credits rolled, I had a big smile on my face."
3419,1,
3420,1,"Feast of the Seven Fishes is a movie with a lot of heart, swirling with emotion and nostalgia, using the Christmas setting to great advantage."

3540,0,"The heart is in the right place for Your Lucky Day, but the execution is a little loose."
3541,1,Daniel Brown’s feature debut Your Lucky Day is a smart thriller that manages to be lean and mean while still offering up some excellent social criticism.
3542,1,"It is very much an ensemble film, yet it also serves as one of the final demonstrations of how Cloud could command a scene like no one else. That alone makes Your Lucky Day a bittersweet gift, but the sharp film also has quite a lot else going on as well."
3543,0,"While scrutinizing how capitalistic greed fuels socioeconomic desperation, the film doesn’t sustain its tension or develop sufficient emotional investment amid the contrived chaos."
3544,1,"It's thrilling and suspenseful, with enough twists to keep you guessing, but the pointed commentary is impossible to ignore."
3545,1,"Your Lucky Day is good verging on great, and suggests that Cloud was well on his way to becoming great too."
3546,1,Briskly paced and engrossing.
3547,0,It might not be the best move to have characters repeatedly explain how and why the plot of a thriller shouldn't and probably won't work.
3548,1,The film coasts far on the pleasant surprise of some sharp plotting.
3549,1,An unrelentingly tense and emotionally engaging film that draws on the real phenomenon of lottery winners’ murders to create a thriller that manages to walk the fine line between exciting and too real. It’s something special.
3550,1,"'Your Lucky Day' finds Angus Cloud and the rest of the cast on sparkling form in a twisting, turning, and altogether unpredictably thrilling time."
3551,0,"It'd be great to be able to say that young Angus Cloud's final, ironically-titled film underscores the tragedy of his untimely death. But irony or not, the mixed bag that is ""Your Lucky Day"" just isn't good enough to use as an epitaph."
3552,1,"Writer-director Daniel Brown’s crime drama is deceptively simple with a beer case’s worth of twists, most of which are unpredictable but make perfect character sense as they unfold."
3553,1,"The theme is simply that the pursuit of money leads to harm, proportional to the amount of money at stake. Your Lucky Day has enough twists on the hostage drama formula to keep it engrossing until the end."
3554,1,A pulpy thriller that works more than not to deliver a gritty story of greed born from moments of desperation.
3555,1,"A lean, suspenseful and gritty crime thriller."
3556,1,"Its well-built scenes of suspense maintain a momentum that’s equivalent to a composer making music. There are many spinning plates here, and it’s dazzling to see Brown and Co. bounce them around without shattering."
3557,1,"There is a deep moral conflict in the center of Your Lucky Day, with powerful acting, making this an impressive feature debut."
3558,1,Your Lucky Day presents a familiar setup of normal people having their morals challenged for monetary gain but executes it very well. The film takes many turns to keep you guessing in the story as well as shifting focus of protagonists.
3559,1,"""Your Lucky Day"" succeeds where many other thrillers do not. Brown effectively builds the claustrophobic world of the store and lets the characters shine."
3560,1,"Without giving away too many details, the ending is simply too outrageous, but by the time director Brown gets us there, I was mostly on board for this pressure-cooker of a thriller."
3561,1,"Brown uses it to craft an intense siege thriller filled with characters making surprising choices and moral concessions. Anchored by Garza’s charismatic, primal turn, Your Lucky Day makes for an impressive debut that’ll leave you on edge."
3562,1,"Your Lucky Day moves along at an engaging pace throughout, although it doesn't reach its brutal potential as a thriller until two-thirds of the way through. Up to that point, it's burdened by clumsy repetition of its central theme."
3563,1,An intense thriller that shows how quickly people will throw their morals out the window for the chance to be rich.
3564,1,"Complex and confronting, Your Lucky Day highlights the downfall of the American dream and system beautifully. A solid script and some excellent elements of suspense ensure that this is one Christmas you won’t forget in a hurry."
3565,1,"In expanding his 16-minute short into an 89-minute feature, Daniel Brown created morally complex characters that find commonality in the struggle and lie of the elusive American Dream."
3566,1,"It’s a twisty, thrilling, unbearably tense rollercoaster ride that’s difficult to predict and keeps you on the edge of your seat. For those who enjoy a bit more depth to their action-packed thrills, Brown’s compelling script offers plenty of that, too."

3588,1,"Presenting us with very human protagonists and developing a potentially boring narrative with energy, “BlackBerry” works as a docu-drama. Surely those who were alive at this time and had a BlackBerry will feel some nostalgia. Full review in Spanish."
3589,1,"Despite playing the story for more laughs than are probably necessary, the lead performances of BlackBerry are very watchable, and the story of the brand’s rise and demise is certainly one worth watching."
3590,1,"This entertaining film features standout work from Baruchel, especially when he begins to crack with the realization that Apple is getting ready to kill his company with their upcoming iPhone, a product with the highest consumer interest in history."
3591,1,BlackBerry is an impressive feat that marks Johnson’s leap from indie darling/TV Director to someone to genuinely watch out for.
3592,1,"Investing heartily in its story's personalities, and eschewing myth-making reverence or preciousness, BlackBerry's makers entertainingly frame their film as a workplace dramedy about industry gate-crashers rudely ejected from a party of their own staging."
3593,1,"Pacy, well-acted, and brilliantly written, this boardroom farce pushes all right the buttons."
3594,1,"Rise-and-fall stories so often gloat after the bursting of the bubble, but this one is all condolences."
3595,1,"[BlackBerry] perfectly captures the nerds-versus-the-system volatility of the tech bubble: Baruchel and Johnson stammer and gulp, while Howerton commands the film like a fascist warrior who uses fools to floss his teeth."
3596,1,Johnson is also ruthless in his depiction of the business reality behind the glossy surface waffle of the tech dream.
3597,1,"Yet despite the guffaws, the film (directed by Matt Johnson) is deeper than a mere morality play about villainous money men."
3598,1,"It’s a film, ultimately, about failure. And immediately that makes it a far more intriguing proposition than all the boardroom backslapping of a movie such as Air."
3599,1,"Blackberry gets lost in the minutiae of its own story halfway through, but is otherwise an entertaining cautionary tale.​"
3600,1,"Bolstered by sterling work from Baruchel and a ferociously good Howerton as the unscrupulous Balsillie, BlackBerry is a cautionary tale of tech-world hubris told with dark humour and a satirical edge."
3601,1,"Business-orientated stories don’t always make great entertainment, but BlackBerry works through its eccentric mix of characters, droll screenplay and the inherent drama of its vertiginous rise-and-fall storyline."
3602,1,This is a watchable enough film...
3603,1,A device that went the way of the dodo gets a lively epitaph you won’t need your hand held to enjoy.
3604,1,It's all down to the performances that sets 'BlackBerry' apart from the herd of other corpo-dramas of late.
3605,1,All three leads are superb and Johnson’s sharp script and fly-on-the-wall shooting style enables him to walk a fine between venerating and eviscerating his subjects.
3606,1,"A corporate comedy of errors — but the film really shines thanks to Howerton, whose towering, shark-like performance makes him a villain for the ages."
3607,0,"The characters are thinly sketched stereotypes (with the exception of Howerton, who it is hard not to like in any role). This is the kind of movie you would watch on a plane without complaint, then utterly forget."
3608,1,"It's an intriguing take on the spectacular rise and demise of the cell phone that everyone had to have, until they didn't, but aspects of the movie's style and tone are distracting and over-drawn, detracting from its impact overall"
3609,1,"Even more than The Social Network, where Aaron Sorkin’s script treats Mark Zuckerberg and co like flawed deities, this blackly comic corporate drama finds something intrinsically ridiculous about these egotistical men."
3610,1,BlackBerry is one of the BEST films of the year and a fully realized Canadian heritage moment.
3611,1,"After the product romance comes the product tragedy. While Barbie is boosting Mattel’s sales figures, and Air made everybody feel warm and fuzzy about Nike’s best-selling sports shoe, for the BlackBerry it’s all too late"
3612,1,"Even when Blackberry centres on the cautionary tale of the company’s demise, it also tells a refreshing and entertaining part of geek and tech history."
3613,1,Blackberry is a classic rags-to-riches-to-rags story; a feel-good tale that transforms into a meditation on arrogance and neglect.
3614,1,"BlackBerry is a timely and excellent reminder that, that as far as that piece of technology you’re reading this review on, there’s always something better just around the corner."
3615,1,BlackBerry is a well written drama with amazing charactersiation and tension. I would not be surprised at all if this wasn’t a sleeper surprise come Oscar time because this is one of the best written and acted films I have seen so far this year.
3616,1,If you are fascinated by fiscal tales of woe such as those spun by The Big Short then this is the movie for you.
3617,1,"BlackBerry takes viewers on a roller coaster ride in telling this 'based on a true story' about the rise and fall of BlackBerry, the first popular smartphone. Glenn Howerton gives a standout performance as a greedy corporate villain with a nasty temper."
3618,1,… a hilarious and decidedly more fictionalised take on the tech biopic sub-genre that still says a lot about the sector and how desperation is the father of invention.
3619,1,Director Matt Johnson’s nutty slice of tech history is a crack-up at the start. But nobody is laughing when the BlackBerry’s nuts and bolts come undone.
3620,1,"All the pressures and compromises of corporate life are on show, magnified by the speed at which the tech industry moves."
3621,1,"A bleakly comic requiem for an almost forgotten one-time technological breakthrough, BlackBerry is heck of a ride."
3622,1,Excellent. More inventive and with more invective than anticipated.
3623,1,"Snappy editing, sharp dialog, and a judicious rock soundtrack create an exciting portrait of an insanely successful high-tech startup – until, of course, fortunes turn."
3624,1,"BlackBerry is a compelling blend of technology history, human relationships, and the ever-looming fear of becoming irrelevant."
3625,1,Matt Johnson takes a quintessential biopic formula and makes his audience understand that good ideas can falter under the weight of men who can’t see the sky beyond the clouds.
3626,1,"Matt Johnson’s heartfelt, humorous biopic manifests as both a new Canadian classic and a vibrant entry into the tech-movie canon."
3627,1,"You already know what happens to Blackberry, but seeing how it all happens is part of the fun."
3628,1,"The MVP: Glenn Howerton as BlackBerry’s unscrupulous co-CEO, Jim Balsillie, who never met an underling he didn’t want to snap in half."
3629,1,"BlackBerry is a refreshing, thought-provoking entry into the origin story film genre with its focus on the rise and fall of the first smartphone, the Blackberry."
3630,1,...the balance of goofy and deadpan suits the pacing once the phone launches on the market.
3631,1,[It] turns what would be a boring story about corporate strategy into high stakes drama.
3632,1,"BlackBerry’s smart writing, zippy pace and thoroughly Canadian approach gives it a great deal of charm."
3633,1,A gripping biographical tech-thriller with refreshingly witty passages and character-driven fortitude as its most entertaining values.
3634,1,A surprisingly entertaining film about the ups and downs of a unique business venture.
3635,1,"BlackBerry stands out by not being a nostalgic recounting of A Thing We Love From A Simpler Time, but a cautionary tale of how the same cycles of greed and corruption continue to play out over and over."
3636,1,The rise and fall of the smartphone-turned-status symbol is chronicled in the funniest film of the year by writer-director Matt Johnson.
3637,1,Johnson keeps things distinctly character-focused and never loses sight of the humanity at his story’s core. And all while being effortlessly funny in a subdued sharply witty way.
3638,1,"For a while, 2023 had a new top film."
3639,1,BlackBerry is a funny character-driven exploration of the rise and fall of a company and its two very different CEOs brought to life through powerful performances from Glenn Howerton and Jay Baruchel.
3640,1,"BlackBerry is at its best when it has room to breathe and space to get loud. It’s theatrical in the best sense of the word, and a finely shot and composed comedy of misfits and mistakes."
3641,1,"BlackBerry is as witty and sharp as it is entertaining, with its two leads, Baruchel and Howerton, absolutely nailing their characters and mining each for every bit of comedy and, indeed, drama."
3642,1,BlackBerry made me want to run through a wall and scream about the beauty of movies for adults until I was hoarse. This really is one of the year’s best movies.
3643,1,An excellent exploration of an innovative but doomed product.
3644,1,"Howerton plays Balsillie like an actual shark – perpetually on the hunt, dead-eyed and dispassionate."
3645,1,"""BlackBerry"" is a comic drama, and in true Canadian style, it ­features plenty of irony and satire. The movie isn’t actually about smartphones or the building of a company—it just uses a real company as the setting for the rise and fall of fallible men."
3646,1,Glenn Howerton has a perfect way of twitching his eyes and tensing his mouth and cocking his head to convey both intense frustration and unearned confidence. It’s Oscar-worthy work.
3647,1,"The mixture of creativity, and humor with cut-throat business is an intriguing tale."
3648,1,...a fairly typical biopic that admittedly does remain a cut above its similarly-themed brethren...
3649,1,"A wildly entertaining account of, as one character describes it, “The smart phone everyone had before they had an iPhone.”"
3650,1,The sense of impending doom is palpable throughout this excellent dramedy about the rise and fall of the iconic mobile phone.
3651,1,"An interesting character study of the two wildly different BlackBerry CEO's for whom the small, black, plastic phone functioned as Icarus's wings and flew them both too close to the sun. And plastic, like wax, melts. An engaging, cautionary tale."
3652,1,"Enjoyably seething, dorky and wryly comic."
3653,1,"This is one of those whip-smart, character- and story-driven gems that grabs you from the start and never lets go."
3654,1,"The drama doesn't justify [the style], but once you get past that, the script is really quite good."
3655,1,Baruchel is brilliant here as Lazaridis in what is easily one of his best performances.
3656,1,BlackBerry is all the more riveting because of how complex its characters are. So much so that you end up both loving and hating each of the characters in equal measure.
3657,1,"With doc-style filmmaking actor-director Matt Johnson maintains a witty tone that's thoroughly engaging, even as the movie stretches into a somewhat over-extended conclusion."
3658,1,"BlackBerry is a funny, insightful dramedy about the smartphone that started it all."
3659,1,"With a robust and compelling story in hand,  BlackBerry begins by returning us to the Pleistocene days of the 1990s..."
3660,1,"Interestingly ambivalent and scabrously funny, it’s an inverted 'Social Network' for also-rans."
3661,1,"Like the device at its center, this film is smart, nimble and pretty much of a kick."
3662,1,Glenn Howerton's comedic fingerprints are all over this film in the best way possible; anyone acting alongside him is automatically elevated to his level.
3663,1,"A period piece about the founding of a transformational and dramatically tragic tech company with an inimitable, blackly comic performance at it center."
3664,1,"Howerton brings something to BlackBerry, the scrappy Canadian indie about a scrappy Canadian company that changed the world, that goes above and beyond his usual lovable sociopath act. It’s not range. It’s rage."
3665,1,What emerges from the electronic noise and fussy aesthetic of “BlackBerry” is a compelling portrait of a company that flew too close to the sun.
3666,1,BlackBerry is one of the biggest surprises of 2023. A razor-sharp cautionary tale about the phone that was ahead of Apple in the mobile device game.
3667,1,"Although Blackberry could have gone deeper with certain characters and themes, it succeeds in remaining intriguing throughout, and exuding a genuine sense of regret by its end."
3668,1,"Entertains, lacks staying power."
3669,1,"If the end result is being even less interested in seeing corporations—and the shady men who run them—reap enormous profits off our endless desire for the Next Big Thing, well, maybe that’s the uplifting story we need after all."
3670,1,"Howerton gets the role of a life time, as this Juilliard trained actor completely disappears into the hockey loving, Gordon Gekko wannabe dispelling the stereotype of the nice Canadian. It's a tour-de-force performance."
3671,1,"The film solidly follows the formula of a biopic and yet never falls into its generic beats. Thanks in large part to a career-defying turn from Glenn Howerton, who nails every single confrontation like a champ."
3672,1,Along with Air I think we got two very well made films about business that are actually interesting and worth watching that do feel more than just commercials for capitalism.
3673,1,"Matt Johnson’s taut, entertaining, alarming film, precise, resonant script ... a colossal story, a Greek myth about rage, greed, naivete, and exploitation that thuds, landing hard on the earth from a great height. Johnson’s direction is flawless."
3674,1,"BlackBerry is not a film that takes a radical departure from the form, but its mixture of comedy and workplace drama — taking cues from the likes of The Big Short and The Office — makes it delectable viewing."
3675,1,The most important aspect of BlackBerry is the fact that this is not a hero’s journey for anyone involved; this is a story about what it means to be smart in some ways and dumb in others.
3676,1,"Johnson applies a screwball procedural framework to a true story of tech-world boom and bust, building his movie on a clash of values and personalities."
3677,0,"“BlackBerry” plays like a prototype still waiting to be realized, a sketch that’s still undeveloped."
3678,1,An extreme look at extreme characters with necessary personality clashes and some incredible performances.
3679,1,"Its point is less to document an actual product development process, and more to offer a parable of nerds colliding headfirst with cutthroat capitalism."
3680,1,"BlackBerry isn’t the best workplace drama of the season, but it is funny and engaging."
3681,1,"Matt Johnson capably assembles a cool, chaotic R&D docudrama looking back at the Blackberry with tech savvy humor, ripe for the picking."
3682,1,BlackBerry is incredibly entertaining.
3683,1,"BlackBerry is a fast, funny and often thrilling ride, one that ends up worthy of both time spent and time capsule."
3684,1,"More than tech geeks can revel in the nostalgia of this captivating comedy, which eschews mockery in favor of a crowd-pleasing balance of quirks and heart."
3685,1,"BlackBerry is a clever and intentional tale of everything that could have and did go awry with the world's first smartphone. Full of fallible and selfish characters, it serves as an antidote to overly saccharine success stories."
3686,1,"The movie is an intense laugh riot, though laden with fraught drama as things fall apart."
3687,1,"While the groundbreaking smartphone was the beginning of the digital slippery slope we trudge through today, the heart of BlackBerry is a story about friendship.  It's about what we lose as our ambitions get the better of us."
3688,1,"It’s romantic, funny and gives you all those holiday feels"
3689,0,"EXmas has a snappy run-time and the perfect seasonal atmosphere, but disappoints with it's lacklustre laughs and lack of chemistry."
3690,0,"The performances are laughably bad, with labored line delivery and strained attempts at being funny. Meester and Amell have decent chemistry, but this is probably one film they’d rather forget being a part of."
3691,0,"I really wanted to like this movie but the main characters were just too unlikable and there was a bit too much going on for it to wrap up into one cohesive, satisfying gift of a Christmas movie."
3692,0,It’s a poorly thought-out and joyless seasonal film I can’t recommend you waste your time streaming. Not even as a Freevee.
3693,1,"To my delight, EXmas is one of the year’s most unexpected holiday surprises, a warm and highly amusing comedy that genuinely feels like a 90-minute glimpse into a big family holiday."
3694,1,There’s a lot of heart as they tap into different holiday traditions with a fresh humor. Amell is as likeable as ever and he and Meester have a magical chemistry. [Jonah Feingold] does a great job telling really endearing and charming romantic stories.
3695,0,"Feingold isn’t challenging anything in the writing, simply here to maintain suburban snowscapes and guide his actors through pedestrian acts of humor and heart."
3696,1,A bit more patience in the set-up would have helped articulate the film's central conflict.
3697,1,"Completely and utterly charming, what a great way to get into the holiday mood! Great comedic chemistry between the leads. Unexpectedly heartwarming and emotional, too."
3698,0,… a Yuletide torture chamber …
3699,0,"It's Christmas-decked doldrums despite its promising leads. The potential was present, but the lack of stakes, chemistry, and modicum of believability make EXmas a pass, not passable."
3700,1,"It’s romantic, funny and gives you all those holiday feels"
3701,0,"EXmas has a snappy run-time and the perfect seasonal atmosphere, but disappoints with it's lacklustre laughs and lack of chemistry."

3748,0,"Kandahar is a typical Gerald Butler’s mindless, obscenely violent action film without a soul."
3749,0,"Formulaic chase thriller, that's tedious but is at least competently made."
3750,1,"The beginning plants an idea that goes beyond the genre, and the audience can take it or leave it. [Full review in Spanish]"
3751,0,"Though it sounds like a conventional action movie, Kandahar... subjects Butler to a journey in which he will encounter different characters who are wounded –not so much physically, but spiritually- by the war. [Full review in Spanish]"
3752,1,Their new film is a competent war action thriller that shows us the fate of the people who were not able to leave when the allied forces did.
3753,0,"Kandahar frames itself within the action genre with characters that fall into stereotypes and exaggerations, even reaching the point of ridicule, and it becomes a simplistic message about its own subject. [Full review in Spanish]"
3754,0,"Kandahar is blighted by predictable action, one-dimensional characters and a political sensibility that’s best described as jingoistic, jaundiced and xenophobic."
3755,0,"“Kandahar” is a failed final product, with interesting intentions, but too irregular an execution. If only it were more tense, and if they had removed some unnecessary secondary characters, I'm sure the film would have been better. Full review in Spanish."
3756,1,"While the political machinations of how Butler found himself in hot water in the first place are frustratingly muddied... Nevertheless, he's a reliably rugged presence perfectly at ease with what he's tasked to do."
3757,1,"Gerard Butler proves he has more in the tank than just thoughtless action with this Middle East-set thriller, which is unexpectedly interested in the people and politics behind the usual explosions."
3758,1,"‘…a more-than-watchable star-vehicle, but falling way short of what a gallus unit like Butler should be able to bring to the fray…'"
3759,0,The action sequences are not gripping and the quiet moments are as subtle as a battering ram
3760,0,"With minimal dramatic elements that are included as a checklist, explosions and shootouts, the movie becomes unacceptable... [Full review in Spanish]"
3761,1,"And though the film's reach greatly exceeds its grasp, it's something of a treat to see the always charismatic Butler try his hand at something a bit more substantial than his usual fare."
3762,0,It is a bit forgettable that makes it feel too familiar to the point that you wish you were watching something else
3763,0,"It’s not unwatchable, although some of it is plainly unforgiveable."
3764,1,... The ensemble gives off an unmistakable '80s aroma that smells like napalm in the morning. [Full review in Spanish]
3765,0,"Plenty of action but only action. No reason to root for the characters, aside form what they were , not who they were."
3766,0,"Kandahar’s remorseful tone about US foreign policy is ironic, considering where, and under whose supervision the movie was made."
3767,1,"A decent action thriller with a touch of political awareness that's serviceable, but, beyond that, there's nothing memorable here and there are better entries in the Butler ""genre"". [Full review in Spanish]"
3768,1,"We give it three stars, but five Gerard Butlers. [Full review in Spanish]"
3769,0,"The movie’s pervasively underwhelming and uninvolving atmosphere is perpetuated by its continuing emphasis on thinly-developed, entirely lackluster subplots..."
3770,0,"I did not care for this film. If I tell you that this is an action-thriller starring Gerard Butler, then you know exactly what you're getting."
3771,1,"Very much by design, these filmmakers have crafted a unique antiwar film that allows ideas about the futility of war to rise to the surface."
3772,0,"If I’m going to watch this man retcon the war on terror to look heroic, it should at the very least be over-the-top enough to be entertaining."
3773,1,"We’re in Butler’s wheelhouse. He gets better in this genre as he ages, and using his native Scotland tongue is always a bonus. Say what you want about his choices after Leonidas, but he thoroughly enjoys playing these imperfect heroes."
3774,0,A paint by numbers action film that struggles to find its heart.
3775,0,"There's nothing wrong with these sort of movies, but there's nothing particular good or memorable about them either."
3776,1,"Butler’s movies exist in a world mostly untouched by reality, as though the golden era of direct-to-DVD action flicks never went away. For better and for worse, “Mission Kandahar” fits that mold."
3777,0,How much one enjoys the new action-thriller Kandahar probably depends on how much one enjoys Butler himself.
3778,0,Gerard Butler action movies aren't among my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours. Butler's latest -- Kandahar -- didn't do enough to change my mind...
3779,1,Waugh delivers a thrilling action film and an adventure filled with heroes and villains we’re compelled by.
3780,1,"Kandahar is sturdy, Butler brings precisely what he’s supposed to, a few character actors do very nice work, and it looks good."
3781,0,"A superficial gloss at best, a confusing, muddled mess at worst."
3782,1,"This Afghanistan-set actioner starts off pretty rough, with tons of exposition and little character, but as it moves along and narrows its focus, it becomes surprisingly gripping, even emotional."
3783,0,"Kandahar gets awfully convoluted and takes too long to get to the main mission in the story. The film editing is sloppy, while the action scenes are unremarkable. The movie's worst idea is the secret CIA surveillance room that gets unrealistic footage."
3784,1,"Dir. Waugh has a way with action sequences, and given that the mission of Butler's character is to infiltrate nuclear secrets and build ups, there is some tension to what’s at stake. At what point does loss equal futility? The defines war in Afghanistan."
3785,0,"Butler is good, but they still miss the exit in Kandahar."
3786,1,We get to see Butler in his element.
3787,0,"This film seems to want to be about more than just the action highlighted in the finale. However, with the various levels of pontification and introspection, the pace drags to a halt at multiple points."
3788,1,"What [Butler] delivers is precisely what fans are likely looking for, albeit in a package that’s more politically muddled than is necessary."
3789,1,"It has the virtue of being more than a quotidian action tale of espionage and its attendant machinations. By taking a brooding rather than kinetic approach, it becomes a bittersweet meditation on the idea that modern wars are not meant to be won."
3790,1,"There's plenty of gunplay and explosions for the action junkies, but more importantly, the main characters are well-rounded and interesting. So if you've enjoyed Butler's last few movies, expect more of the same."
3791,1,"If you’ve ever found yourself wondering why Hollywood doesn’t make films like The Hunt for Red October or Air Force One anymore, you might have found your new favorite movie."
3792,0,"Our heroes need to catch a plane in ‘Kandahar’, but this pedestrian action flick never takes off."
3793,0,"[A]t some point, someone carved out the ambiguity and ambivalence [in the script] but didn’t replace it with much compelling."
3794,1,An explosive adventure that hurtles from beginning to end.
3795,1,"The very definition of escapist entertainment, Mission Kandahar is above average Butler, no matter how disposable it is."
3796,1,"Don't treat Kandahar like ""another Gerard Butler action flick,"" even for those who like them. Expect more from this movie. Because it delivers."
3797,1,Kandahar is not a run-of-the-mill actioner. It’s refreshing that time is taken to develop the players and make them fully human.
3798,0,"Not particularly juicy or, you know, action-packed."
3799,0,Another one of these? Gerard Butler can't fix the Middle East.
3800,1,"As with the other films Butler has done with director Ric Roman Waugh, like “Angel Has Fallen” and “Greenland,” plot and character are simply excuses to get to the next action scene."
3801,0,Kandahar represents a so-so retread that will likely become a forgotten footnote in the Butler’s resume.
3802,0,"Butler’s latest rugged action hero is within his comfort zone, although the film is less compelling between its set pieces."
3803,0,Butler drives another redundant thriller towards a calculable conclusion.
3804,0,"You can't ""both sides"" a one-dimensional escape film. Giving your Brown men wives and desires for modernity doesn't magically erase that you’re still equating their existence with evil. The least you could do is own it."
3805,1,"Kandahar's script lives in a morally gray area, but the filmmaking is proficient enough to keep audiences engaged."
3806,1,"Director Ric Roman Waugh, a former stuntman, frames and cuts with vigor and Butler’s lug mug is always a captivating presence atop his masterful slab of stillness and motion."
3807,0,"In case we should ever forget, Kandahar is here to remind us of how dangerous that part of the world can be."
3808,0,"As a war movie, it’s not especially insightful or gut-wrenching. As an action film, it lacks energy, momentum, and consistency. As a drama, it feels artificial and manipulative."
3809,0,Kandahar is a disposable Gerard Butler adventure. There's just nothing about it that stands out in the slightest.
3810,1,This is a thrilling action throwback that keeps your pulse racing and your butt on the edge of your seat. Kandahar is a reminder that great action can still deliver a bang.
3811,1,An efficient and glossy action thriller…as long as we don’t think about it too much.
3812,1,"The tangle of political interests is so thick you can barely see the root motivations in “Kandahar,” and thorns of personal grievance are all the sharper for it."
3813,0,"The film accomplishes what it sets out to do, but it’s standard entertainment that pushes for more than it can deliver."
3814,1,"While it's gritty, well-made, and realistic, ""Kandahar"" is a one-note movie with no dramatic arc."
3815,0,A convoluted but tedious tale of espionage and escape that almost seems like a throwaway despite an effort to add some sympathetic notes about the damage the American involvement in Afghanistan did to many of the locals.
3816,0,The sort of textureless action thriller that sounds like it’s been musically scored by a subwoofer.
3817,1,"Another solid, decent action thriller led by Mr. Gerard Butler. Cinematography and sound elevate some nifty action sequences, while actor Navid Negahban stands out. [Full review in Spanish]"
3818,0,"An overlong, tedious and anemic snoozefest that's low on thrills, suspense and intrigue. In a double feature with Guy Ritchie's The Covenant, it would be the vastly inferior B-movie."
3819,1,Gerard Butler and director Ric Roman Waugh are pros at this kind of mid-level action flick. Well-acted and assembled.
3820,1,"While Kandahar is undoubtedly spectacular war cinema, it's also a weighty meditation on the seeming impossibility for some of walking away from conflict."
3821,1,"A decent (if forgettable) military thriller where the action scenes come with a dose of emotional weight, and not just explosions for the sake of empty entertainment."
3822,0,It's ultimately superficial...
3823,0,"Butler is good when he’s in a movie that knows it’s junk and manages to keep a straight face about it. Kandahar gets the straight face right, but seems woefully convinced that it’s a serious drama."
3824,1,"Butler represents an old school creed of gritty leading men, the kind of actor who can pull up his bootstraps and deliver a slender two hour escape where the viewer doesn’t have to use their brain cells."
3825,1,"Smarter than expected, but lacking in the action one might be expecting."
3826,0,"Not only is the pace tepid at best, but Tom is a bore, with at least three characters more intriguing than he is."
3827,0,"Tell me AI couldn’t have conceived, negotiated, packaged/cast and scripted this utterly generic road/action picture."
3828,0,"'Kandahar' finds Gerard Butler doing what he does best, and while there are some admirable attempts to deviate from formula, the end result isn't going to be regarded among the action hero's top tier."
3829,0,"Isn’t sharp enough to be taken seriously as an offering of political and religious examination, and not active enough to provide a hard-charging viewing experience."
3830,0,"This desert dry actioner is filled with lazy, laughable clichés and poorly orchestrated spectacle."
3831,1,"Kandahar strikes at the heart of geopolitical and human rights issues embroiling the Middle East. Slick action scenes, especially a spectacular nighttime helicopter chase, rescue the narrative from lulls."
3832,0,"While occasional bursts of excitement draw one back into the plight, they are short-lived reprieves from the banal displays that not even the actors can salvage."
3833,0,"What it does in the first hour isn’t particularly good. Neither is what it switches to for the second. That leaves you feeling as though you’ve seen two bad movies when it’s over, rather than just one."
3834,1,"While Kandahar can be a bit sluggish at times, it’s all in service of a film that goes to great lengths to be more substantial than the typical action movie or political thriller."
3835,1,"By law, every summer movie season should include at least one Gerard Butler film."
3836,1,The year's second best film about an American and his translator in Afghanistan.
3837,1,"It’s an action and suspense film, and, like Butler’s earlier 2023 flick “Plane,” a good one."
3838,0,"The script...is too much of a kitchen sink and, often times, the story goes into the weed. The resolution to this dilemma by director Ric Roman Waugh is to just leave the ends loose and hope no one notices. That is sloppy filmmaking, to me."
3839,1,It’s solid and gripping and tries to do more with its storyline than you’d expect.
3840,1,"Butler is like an old battered suitcase of an action hero — banged-up and rough around the edges, but dependable and durable. ""Kandahar"" plays to his world-weary strengths."
3841,0,"Waugh knows how to stage bombastic destruction and admirably wants to tell a thoughtful story around that, but he also gets lost within too many characters when the compelling dynamic between Tom and translator Mo provides enough riveting drama"
3842,0,"Kandahar is very much a box-ticking exercise, with Butler playing the same kind of hero he has built a career out of."
3843,1,"While it isn’t the thrill-a-minute ride the trailer suggests, the action scenes we get are intense and exciting, especially in the riveting final third where things really ratchet up. As for Butler, he’s given a character who fits his strengths nicely."
3844,0,"With this past January’s Plane and now Kandahar, B-movie mainstay Gerard Butler has officially entered his Sad Dad era."
3845,0,"For ""Kandahar"" to be called an action film, there should be action, right?"
3846,0,"For a movie that follows a man stuck in a country where U.S. coalition troops have now finally left, Kandahar never conjures the sense of paranoia and fear."
3847,0,"More than anything, the greatest problem is how boring it all is. None of the action scenes have any passion to them and, even worse, they can feel downright contrived. That it then pretends to have something more to say strains credulity."
3848,0,"The problem is that the movie is constantly, almost compulsively, deflecting in order not to make it too, too clear what it’s actually about."
3849,1,"It's super fun, exciting, and surprising. [Full review in Spanish]"
3850,0,"…a hard-sell for a 60 year old product you already bought, used, grew out of and got bored of some time ago…"
3851,1,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is AMAZING and a REVOLUTIONARY achievement in animation. It’s a wild and darker journey that is FULL of JAW-DROPPING surprises. Spider-Man has never looked so good.
3852,1,"Everything audiences have seen thus far from the first frame of ""Into"" to the last of ""Across"" means something to the larger story, and it’s been in front of us the whole time."
3853,1,A sequel that’s just as good as its predecessor.
3854,1,"For a 140 min film, you’ll feel like you’re in an art gallery in the sense that you know there’s not enough time in the day to see everything, so you go ahead and make an internal commitment to come back."
3855,1,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a brilliant film with empathetic writing and characters we care about not to mention a visual masterpiece. It transcends genre to be one of the most enjoyable and engrossing releases of 2023.
3856,1,"'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse' travels worlds to upend its own status quo, spinning a truly unique and sometimes devastating narrative that finally matches its visual ambitions."
3857,1,"A giddying swing through a dizzying array of animation styles, this sequel to ‘Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse’ is an epic joy-ride on the space-time continuum"
3858,1,"Thank you for the contrasting animation styles that express and enhance each separate universe. Thank you for the unparalleled artistry, the emotional story, the playful humor, and the invigorating action."
3859,1,"Against all odds, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is even better than its predecessor laying credible claim to one of the strongest comic book entries ever. No need for an asterisk limiting it to just the animation category."
3860,1,"The result is a production that is so overwhelming, it may never be fully appreciated even with a multiverse of viewings."
3861,1,"Its visual design is preceded by nothing save for the first Spider-Verse, and Lord and Miller oversee further progression by crafting distinctive aesthetics for each of the half-dozen or so universes within this narrative."
3862,1,"Spider–Man: Across the Spider–Verse is gloriously additive, and the result is the best comic book movie ever made."
3863,1,"Across the Spider-Verse is the emotionally driven Spiderman movie people have been waiting for. There is no death gimmick used here to driven the emotion, instead it's driven by a great story that leans on a parents love and understanding."
3864,1,"Although the animation is still terrific, casual admirers of the first film might want to bow out because there are fewer jokes and a solemn devotion to Spider-Man lore."
3865,1,"Thrillingly inventive visuals, an absolute can't-miss movie in spite of having not much to say and insisting on saying it anyway."
3866,1,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium."
3867,1,"While the abundance of animation and plethora of characters surrounding Miles might seem daunting for a comic book movie about a teenage Spider hero, the good outweighs the bad in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The runtime goes by in a flash."
3868,1,"The music, the animation, the characters, and the story all come together to create the greatest Spider-Man movie."
3869,1,"Unapologetically heavy-handed with its stylistic approach, Across the Spider-Verse is a beautifully crafted love letter to every era of Spider-Man’s meaningful history."
3870,1,A cosmic shift happened in 2018 when Into the Spider-Verse premiered in terms of its animation style and colors. Across the Spider-Verse proves that it was not a one-hit wonder.
3871,1,"Across the Spider-Verse relentlessly refuses to be constrained by the borders of its canvas, with its incredible imagery and absorbing ideas utilizing the medium to its full advantage."
3872,1,"Across The Spider verse takes it to another LEVEL! The animation/art styles are spectacular, the character dynamics and relationships are complex and layered. It’s a nonstop multiversal adventure that puts its story first above all."
3873,1,All the money in the world can't make people in tights standing against green screens as visually spectacular and emotionally expressive as the Spider-Verse films.
3874,1,Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse is not only one of the best films of 2023 it is one of the greatest animated films of all time.  The look and feel of this franchise is so uniquely original that it sets itself apart from anything else in the genre.
3875,1,"This is a fantastic movie. Visually very impressive, has a good heart of a story and good character development."
3876,0,"The top-tier (and awards-worthy) animation is drowned by the surplus of characters, jokes, and new sights forcefully crammed in every frame."
3877,1,"It’s smart stuff, leaps and bounds beyond Marvel’s snarky hegemony..."
3878,1,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse features gorgeous animation and non-stop thrills with a killer ending that makes me excited for the next film!
3879,1,"Spiderverse 2 is not just the BEST Spider-Man film of all time, it’s not just the BEST COMIC BOOK FILM of all time, it’s not just the greatest sequel ever made, it’s bar none one of the best films I’ve ever watched. More than a masterpiece."
3880,1,An explosion of creativity and genius as vast as the number of Spider-Man variants inhabiting the infinite realms within the Marvel cosmos.
3881,0,"...a complete trainwreck of a motion picture that has absolutely no business running an astonishing, seemingly never-ending 140 minutes."
3882,1,"an energetic, multifaceted adventure... As visually inventive as its 2018 predecessor, ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE again delivers eye-catching action along with characters of depth and nuance both behind and outside of the mask."
3883,1,"It's amazing how far ""let's make this thing look and feel like a comic book"" can go."
3884,1,"I’m sure Marvel won’t mind if you buy all the merchandise and comic books related to all those Spider-Folks, too."
3885,1,[W]hat’s fast becoming this series’ calling card: action sequences that defy all spatial orientation and come at you at the speed of thought while meticulously maintaining coherence and clarity of audience focus.
3886,1,"While bigger doesn't always mean better, the larger canvas and more elaborate logistics here, in terms of narrative scope and thematic heft, make for a dazzling time at the movies for many (most?) age groups."
3887,1,"Across the Spider-Verse will be viewed as a landmark in animation, and rightfully so."
3888,1,"A funny, heartfelt, and infinitely rewatchable action-comedy that ranks among the superhero genre’s very best."
3889,1,"The original ""Into the Spider-verse"" has a lot of moments that I love. But I think this one actually has more moments that I love."
3890,1,"It’s Easter-egg heaven for fans, a frenetic “Where’s Waldo?” of maximalist splatter-paint pop art. And no doubt it’s an impressive artistic feat. But if Spidey can be anyone or anything, does the beloved specificity of Spider-Man lose its appeal?"
3891,1,"The type of film that proves animation isn't just for kids, and it's certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It's an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema."
3892,1,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse contains some of the finest animation ever put to film. There are stretches that feel revolutionary, glass-ceiling breaks into a new future."
3893,1,"The triangle of directors decides to take very seriously the playfulness that is breathed in the center of Spider-Man, to lead to a work that is endearing at times and theoretical at others, but embraced by a visuality that never loses sight of the game"
3894,1,"Sly, subliminally superb - if self-indulgent - animated superhero saga that becomes an exhausting endurance ordeal...."
3895,0,For the hard core Spiderman follower it is manna from Heaven; for the casual viewer it is almost impossible to figure out.
3896,1,"“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the epitome of the complete art form. Films are a perfect collection of individual art forms....This movie is funny, engaging, masterfully animated and one of the best films ever made"
3897,1,Tempts you to think Spider-Man was always meant to be animated.
3898,1,"Absolutely visually stunning, although it meanders a bit when it comes to plotting."
3899,1,"An outstanding assemblage and use of talent across all facets of filmmaking. The animation itself is the most obvious selling point but in a world where most big budget movies feel like an AI script with studio interference, this screenplay soars."
3900,1,You'd be having the time of your life even if the filmmakers decided to phone the plot in. That they didn't results in a dense work that stimulates the senses more than even INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE could.
3901,1,Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse boldly throws out any restraint and leans full-tilt into the zaniness of its visually and thematically kaleidoscopic world.
3902,1,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse loses none of its predecessor's magnetic cool, nor the admirable blend of sensibility and novelty permeated within every image. [Full review in Spanish]"
3903,1,"Here’s the great news about this excellent Spider-Man film series--it’s like nothing you’ve ever seen before, the animation and live-action set the film apart into its own genre"
3904,1,Viewers feel invested in sharing each success and failure with Gwen and Miles... nothing else comes close to the level of ambition poured out onto the screen... until next year’s (conclusion) mercifully unknots your stomach.
3905,1,"A fun, funny and dazzling adventure that feels groundbreaking and important in a multitude of ways."
3906,1,"There may be a point to all the far-fetched complications in the multiple story lines of this movie, but we'll have to wait until next year to find out if there is."
3907,1,"This movie exceeded all expectations. If you don't like this film, I don't know what you are looking for in movies..."
3908,1,This was an incredible experience. This movie brought me back to my childhood and reignited my love of animation.
3909,1,One of my top five films of all time. I didn't want it to end.
3910,1,"While the visuals once again addictively shut down and reboot a viewer’s mind repeatedly, the scripting is not as enthralling or involving as it was before."
3911,1,"Sun-Spider is voiced by Danielle Perez, herself a wheelchair user. Nor is Sun-Spider the only disabled character in the film."
3912,1,"A cinematic work of art, boasting style and substance with its kinetic, boundary-pushing animation and weighty, dramatic themes of longing and belonging."
3913,1,"From the colorful animation to the impressive voice performances to the diverse and heartfelt characters, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse manages to recapture all of the magic that made the first film such a hit."
3914,1,Across the Spider-Verse isn't just the best comic book film in 2023 to date. It's one of the best films in any genre.
3915,1,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is one of the greatest animated sequels where it takes what made the original highly praised, and elevate it into one of the biggest love letters to Spider-Man."
3916,1,"A billion different art styles collide, with impressionism bleeding into pop art, all set to a punk-hip-hop backbeat in pursuit of asking America’s current defining question: What do we need to do to get more Spider-Cat?"
3917,1,Animated Spider-Man sequel is worth the price of admission in this four-star movie.
3918,1,An irresistible and energetic animation Spidey sequel.
3919,1,"Across the Spider-Verse proves that animation can be a liberating, fantasy-deepening medium that live-action can’t touch. It’s one of the best summer blockbuster to hit screens in years."
3920,1,An extravagant blend of styles and visual ideas and techniques that makes the bleeding-edge radicalism of the 2018 film seem downright boring.
3921,1,"The latest Spider-Man has been called unique, but this is something else--a superhero flick whose characters have personality and dramatic heft, filled with wonderful visuals and wondrous exploits laced with brazen originality."
3922,1,"Diving once again into the Spider-Verse is a delight; unlike many well-worn and exhausted Marvel products, the potential of this franchise feels endless. [Full Review in Spanish]"
3923,1,"Extraordinary animation and muscular transformations make the continuing Spidey saga(s) of Brooklyn teen Miles Morales and his family, friends and foes even more of a marvel."
3924,1,"The filmmakers seem committed to the idea that there can't be too much of a good thing. I think some pruning might have helped, but Across the Spider-Verse reflects a commitment to a visual vision that's meant to dazzle the senses -- and often does."
3925,1,SPIDER-MAN: ACROSS THE SPIDER-VERSE is without question one of the very best films of 2023 so far.
3926,1,Across the Spiderverse is one of the most visually dazzling animated films I've ever seen. The story and characters continue to be great while being only half of a story that ends on a pretty rough cliffhanger is sure to frustrate some viewers.
3927,1,"Across the Spider-Verse feels like a piece of Banksy-inspired street art that is so monumentally cluttered yet mesmerizing at the same time. Flashy visuals, but a story that feels like it's stretched beyond its means."
3928,1,A winning combination of heart and humor backed by some of the most engrossing and hypnotic artwork you’re likely to see in theaters.
3929,1,I think it is storytelling and character development at its greatest.
3930,1,The real magic here is the absolute immersion that the viewer goes through to quite literally see a comic book come to life - you've never seen anything quite like it.
3931,1,"Vibrant, poignant and completely avant-garde: it’s nothing I’ve seen or felt before in an animated feature, and the energy it imbues onto audiences is, like a bite from a radioactive spider, infectious."
3932,1,"There's artistry in every aspect, from the color choices to the backgrounds to the character designs to the framing and composition, and everything else on screen. I keep wanting to go back & watch it again just to get lost in and immersed by all this..."
3933,1,"Chaotic, ferociously paced, frenetic and fun, Across The Spider-Verse almost goes too far in this more-is-more approach."
3934,1,"There’s plenty to work with in this vertiginous, cyclonic, kaleidoscopic collage. The filmmakers employ a hybrid of CGI and animation which is supposed to make the viewer feel like they have entered a comic book."
3935,1,"It’s been a bit since I watched the original Spider-Verse, but the animation is either as good or better than that film."
3936,1,"You're gonna have a good time with this. The character development is top-notch -- you care about Miles, you care about Gwen you care about the family members, you care about the friends."
3937,1,The animation in Across the Spider-Verse is spectacular. It’s breathtakingly innovative and cinematic but also deeply indebted to the comic book form.
3938,1,"It might be hyperbole to say that this state-of-the art animation is about as genius as it gets for the genre. But for kids, teens and twentysomethings, raised on MTV, comic books and TikTok, that isn’t an overstatement. It’s their truth."
3939,1,"The smashing together of styles new and old, the way the hyper-modern is edged with the Roy Lichtenstein-esque pointillism of the original comic books, makes for a retro-futuristic spectacle once again."
3940,1,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a fantastic sequel, and many who loved the first will love the second. It is original, and that is no small achievement for a sequel."
3941,1,Across the Spider-Verse plays to young viewers' wild imaginative energy while showcasing immense adult craft -- the recipe for a film that even a superhero skeptic can enjoy.
3942,1,Capturing the feel of this movie in words feels impossible.
3943,1,"It’s hard to resist the swirling fight scenes and the moments of serenity shared by Miles and Gwen. Pixels put the Spider-Verse in peril, but they also beautifully bridge the vast distance between a girl and a boy."
3944,1,A genuinely thrilling sequel that once again sets the bar extremely high for inventive and imaginative animation.
3945,0,"So, a movie that is 40 minutes or more longer than it should be constitutes a plus for the fans – who will, I think, enjoy it immensely – and a big minus for me."
3946,1,A multiverse story...fully in service of its characters rather than the other way around.
3947,1,"Across the Spider-Verse looks better, sounds better and will maybe even be better than Into the Spider-Verse, but as of now, I only saw 1/2 a story on the screen. It's definitely a movie worth watching but don't expect to leave with the full picture."
3948,0,"Teens who have been through trauma utter greeting card-worthy philosophical twaddle as if it's profound, leaving the audience shrugging."
3949,0,A road-trip romance that doesn’t so much charmingly play out as dully pass by through a VW camper’s windows.
3950,0,"Teens who have been through trauma utter greeting card-worthy philosophical twaddle as if it's profound, leaving the audience shrugging."
3951,0,A road-trip romance that doesn’t so much charmingly play out as dully pass by through a VW camper’s windows.

3958,0,The Naughty Nine falls short in capturing the holiday spirit to make this a memorable film.

3962,0,The Naughty Nine falls short in capturing the holiday spirit to make this a memorable film.
3963,1,That's kind of THE BURIAL's modus operandi outside of Willie's personal trajectory of empathetic growth. Everything is a means to an end and then forgotten. It leads to an entertaining yet messy affair.
3964,1,"Nothing ground-breaking here, but not a bad diversion."
3965,1,"For all its courtroom dramatics and nods toward the continued centrality of race in both the law and business, The Burial is at its best in the moments that emphasize the growing relationship between O’Keefe and Gary"
3966,1,Foxx has rarely been better as he seems to be charged up for playing such a complex person with multiple layers to him.
3967,1,"Tommy Lee and Jamie are believable, wonderful allies as the camaraderie between their characters evolves."
3968,1,"But perhaps not since their 1990s heyday has an example of the form been as entertaining as “The Burial,” the latest directorial effort from “Novitiate” director Maggie Betts."
3969,1,Jamie Foxx is enormously charismatic and so commanding.
3970,1,"A totally charming, crowd-pleasing ""little guy versus the big guy"" story."
3971,1,"The Burial is a unique blend of courtroom drama and ’90s nostalgia, expertly mixing comedy and drama in a way that keeps you hooked from start to finish."
3972,1,"Buoyed by stellar work from Foxx and Jones (both former Oscar winners), the film is full of strong performances."
3973,1,"The Burial is very enjoyable, and I wish it had been a theatrical release, this is one of the best Prime video releases I’ve seen this year."
3974,1,"A well cast, well acted, and well told David vs. Goliath true courtroom drama that is set up to be an all-around crowd pleaser."
3975,1,"Foxx, in particular, does a tremendous job channeling this flashy lawyer tasked with taking on a much more significant case than he is used to. Watching moments where this man is forced to humble himself shows why Foxx succeeds so well as an actor."
3976,1,It’s a fine way to pass a couple of hours in the sure hands of a pair of gifted old-timers (Foxx and Jones) and an up-and-coming newcomer (Betts) who knows how to set off David vs. Goliath fireworks.
3977,1,"Foxx, as a vibrant, flashy extrovert, and Jones, as an aging, modest introvert, make an engaging team, convincingly showing how opposites can see the good in each other and form a strong connection."
3978,1,The friendship that develops between Gary and O’Keefe is what elevates it above others of its ilk. The bond these two develop due to their similar backgrounds and united sense of purpose proves to be the most satisfying aspect of the film.
3979,1,"The Burial doesn’t need to preach to be heard, it is a well-crafted drama about the little guy taking on a corporation and winning not just only for his sake, but the sake of people who society has neglected and relegated disposable."
3980,1,"In some ways you've seen this movie before, in terms of a legal drama...It's an average ""David vs Goliath"" story."
3981,1,"While this familiar crowd-pleasing courtroom drama plays out in predictable – and sometimes, preposterous – ways, what is authentic is the chemistry between the seasoned Oscar-winning duo."
3982,1,"... While The Burial addresses a serious case and problem with a certain air, it doesn't pat itself on the back for it. [Full review in Spanish]"
3983,1,"Foxx is almost giddy as the gospel spirited, gaudy-dressing, cliché-spewing attorney who is out of his league but fighting to the final verdict. Frankly this is the actor’s best performance since Ray."
3984,1,"Foxx and Jones are an entertaining team in this factual ""David vs Goliath"" story."
3985,1,"An old-school lawyer movie: not about a case of life or death, but a story of justice delivered."
3986,1,"Though it might not break new ground, so to speak, “The Burial” is an engaging mix of humor, sentimentality, and uplift—an underdog courtroom tale elevated by an inspired pairing of lead actors."
3987,1,"The Burial is the kind of movie that you can watch with your whole family. It is an old-fashioned, unlikely David and Goliath, suspenseful movie with solid, winning performances, and it is a shame that it will not be playing on big screens in theaters."
3988,1,Jones’ deadpan facial expressions are priceless. He can raise one eyebrow and say it all. Foxx’s energy abounds and it looked like he was having a blast. You’re going to dig The Burial.
3989,0,"The Burial is earnest and emotional enough to please many a crowd, but it ends up being a stale, stilted, and clichéd trip down South."
3990,1,"[Jamie Foxx] is in splendid form in this snappy, crowd-pleasing legal drama from director and co-writer Maggie Betts."
3991,1,"As a film, the drama is framed well, the pacing is taut, and the performances are very good, especially Foxx's, who takes on the figure of Willie Gary with fierce, believable energy and passion."
3992,1,"A crowd pleaser that feels old school. Make no mistake though, without Foxx's grand and grandiose performance, this cinematic case would be easily dismissed."
3993,1,"A nuanced and intelligent legal drama that neatly combines big characters and big ideas. By focusing on wider issues of race and injustice, Betts finds continuing resonance in a case nearly 30 years old."
3994,1,"Tommy Lee Jones and Jamie Fox are so engaging, that yes, they carry you through the humor at the beginning but when you really need to feel the emotion behind it, they give you that too."
3995,0,"Objection! But this story is phony as George Santos playing Matlock ...  it seems like every type of procedural rule is thrown out for cheap drama. This is a money case, and to shoehorn black/white issues seemed crass, plus T Lee Jones is oddly sedate."
3996,1,"It’s a real crowd-pleaser, especially for fans of legal dramas, even if it papers over the details of the contract case with more palatable, easier-to-understand claims."
3997,1,[Jamie] Foxx is front and center in a movie packed with powerful performers. He brings an unchecked charisma and will have audiences eating out of the palm of his hand for the whole film.
3998,0,"Maggie Betts takes a simple and straightforward case and makes a mountain out of a mole hill, amplifying racial undertones of the time period into a place of priority that distracts from what could have been a more compelling courtroom drama."
3999,1,"Everyone involved commits to their respective parts, generating a story that is equally emotional and humorous."
4000,1,Jaime Foxx and Tommy Lee Jones are as good as it gets and a cinematic treat only enhanced by supporting performances from Jurnee Smollett and Mamoudou Athie
4001,1,"Nobody plays the hangdog man of principle better than Tommy Lee Jones, and nobody plays the street-smart-but-vulnerable huckster better than Jamie Foxx — and that, your honor, is my summation in favor of The Burial."
4002,1,"Betts, who did ""Novitiate"" and further back, ""The Carrier,"" keeps this all on the ""feel good"" end of the spectrum and lets Foxx do his thing and everybody else take a shot at stealing this picture from him, and good luck with that."
4003,1,"If many of the plot points are predictable, getting there is half the fun. Jamie Foxx and Tommy Lee Jones are obviously having a great time, and director Maggie Betts achieves just the right comedy/drama balance."
4004,1,Who knew that a legal battle about a funeral home could be this compelling?
4005,1,"As it becomes a lot more interesting -- and worth watching -- than it sounds, credit director Maggie Betts (""Novitiate""), who co-writes with Pulitzer winner Doug Wright, for putting the flashy punctuation marks around it all."
4006,1,"The movie may ping between social drama and IRL courtroom saga. Whenever Foxx struts and frets his two hours upon this stage, you realize that it may simply work best as a star vehicle."
4007,1,"If you need a reprieve from October’s scary slasher flicks, let ‘The Burial’, an entertaining courtroom drama, rise towards the top of your movie queue."
4008,1,"It’s easy to take an actor like Foxx for granted and forget how exceptionally good he is when given a chance. He’s tremendous here, by turns hilarious and touching, and works well with a quiet and underplaying Jones."
4009,1,“The Burial” is a crowd-pleasing David versus Goliath social drama.
4010,1,"The punchy performances, snappy script and exploration of a real world problem – people being milked dry when they are in mourning – make this an entertaining, thoughtful and at times humorous legal drama."
4011,1,"It plays around with the narrative, as all courtroom films do, but it pushes the right buttons to deliver an uplifting story about backing up the little guy."
4012,1,"Taking place in 1995, The Burial is just like great courtroom drama movies of the 1990s. Jamie Foxx shines in this true story about a flashy and persistent attorney representing a small business owner who's suing a corporate giant in the funeral industry."
4013,1,Functions as serviceable VOD comfort food on the strength of its two lead performances.
4014,1,"Movies like ""The Burial"" justify the use and success of the classic Hollywood courtroom dramedy formula, flavor enhancers and all."
4015,1,"The Burial may be a generic courtroom drama, but the performances shine. It is a feel-good movie with an incredible performance by Jamie Foxx that will have you smiling ear-to-ear."
4016,1,"The courtroom battle plays out with crackling intensity, sharp humor and real emotion... and Jamie Foxx delivers a flat-out wonderful performance."
4017,0,"Betts and her team chose to take too many detours in both characters and story, and the film as a whole suffers because of it."
4018,0,"By only brushing up against the factors that make its case fascinatingly, timelessly American, The Burial stays soft, a trial by pillow-fight—but that’s how you please a crowd."
4019,1,Fans of legal dramas will find a most pleasant watch in The Burial. It’s familiar enough to provide a comforting watch while still providing enough challenge and intrigue to surprise.
4020,1,Fellow Texans Foxx and Jones have chemistry to spare. Cast is superb.
4021,1,"For a procedural about a contract dispute among mortuary owners, it's surprisingly full of life."
4022,1,"It is a blast to watch Jamie Foxx in full flight, but it is in the quieter moments that Gary really comes to life."
4023,1,"Jones and Foxx are both in fine form, with the former showing the soft-spoken intensity that has carried much of his career."
4024,1,"As appealing a turn as the Oscar-winning actor has given, and it does much to elevate this inspired-by-real events tale of unlikely alliances and an even more improbable victory."
4025,1,"While it plays fast and loose with the law and even the actual story’s key players, the charming performances and inspirational underpinnings make the movie a crowd-pleaser."
4026,1,"Foxx is every bit as electrifying as the man he is portraying, whether at the pulpit or addressing the jury, and his fellow Oscar-winner Jones is superb in the quieter role of a decent man who will not allow others to treat him indecently."
4027,1,"Though it plays fast and loose with several details, “The Burial” remains true to its focus on race, class, and how capitalism exploits both regardless of a person’s color or financial means. The message is not subtly delivered, but it’s still effective."
4028,1,"While the feel good finale is an unwitting commentary on the absurdity of big dollar legal payouts, it's Foxx who gives The Burial its pulse, finding the layers of humanity underneath his character's surface-level sparkle."
4029,1,"The Burial is about a contract dispute between a white small business owner and a white billionaire. Soon, though, it becomes about much more than that, and the result is a thoroughly entertaining, old-fashioned yet timely courtroom thriller."
4030,1,"The two lawyers are strictly courtroom adversaries, though amicable ones, and it makes The Burial far less predictable than it might have been. So do the two lead performances."
4031,1,The Burial is a potent and captivating film that succeeds in leaving a lasting impact.
4032,1,This crowd-pleaser is a true David and Goliath story that's sure to have you cheering in your seat.
4033,0,"Betts and her co-writers attempt to slowly build their story into a grand revelation, almost looking for the cliched courtroom payoff. When it comes, it unsurprisingly feels more than a bit anti-climactic."
4034,1,"It may sound improbable, but The Burial might be the most entertaining movie ever made about a contract dispute."
4035,1,The film plays out as your typical courtroom saga. It’s a potboiler full of high-octane personalities and fits well within that framework.
4036,1,"The end result is a warm, fuzzy feeling, marred only by the nagging thought of how much better it all could have been."
4037,1,"The Burial doesn’t always make the perfect case for itself, but it’s hard not to like an underdog story with an anti-corporate message delivered with the kind of gusto that Foxx brings to the table."
4038,1,"The Burial is the perfect avenue for watching Foxx go to work. A courtroom drama, mixed with a good bit of comedy, that often feels like a throwback similar to My Cousin Vinny, while keeping the dramatic heft similar to Erin Brockovich."
4039,1,"And if a “cheer for the little guy” moral is all that The Burial offered, it would be a worthwhile crowd-pleaser. But there is more to that title than just a reference to the funeral business."
4040,1,"The cast is excellent, taking Betts, Doug Wright (Quills) and Jonathan Harr's (A Civil Action) words and transforming them into a range of emotions."
4041,1,"Of course its two lead actors give the bravura performances you’d expect from them, but they don’t eat the scenery — they take the material seriously and invest in it with welcome nuance."
4042,1,"Betts delivers pace, charm, and performances, earning her candied moments of audience participation."
4043,1,"The Burial is a decidedly old school courtroom crowd pleaser, for (mostly) better or worse."
4044,1,"The Burial is an engaging legal drama ... The film, though, has some thoughtful observations and incisive points to make along the way..."
4045,1,"The Burial is light on facts, heavy on melodrama, but is elevated by a dynamite turn by Jamie Foxx, who finds that heart-swelling sweet spot that makes courtroom dramas so popular."
4046,1,It does go where it is going without wasting our time and tells a decent true story where the underdog is not in the end.
4047,1,"“The Burial” isn’t a masterpiece, and it was never meant to be. But what’s encouraging here is finding out that Betts can apply the same nuance and rigor to a work of popular entertainment and turn it into something almost great."
4048,1,"The Burial isn’t revolutionary, but it captures the elements of Souther courtroom drama films and engages with elements of race and class directly, making those tropes better for it."
4049,0,"I love a good paperwork movie. “The Burial” is not that. Nor are the legal maneuverings treated with patience and care, even as the whole thing devolves into something of a circus."
4050,1,"Tommy Lee Jones and Jamie Foxx bring humor, heart, and star power to an overall winning narrative. They have tremendous chemistry as a mismatched pair finding common ground to achieve an astonishing legal victory."
4051,1,"Maggie Betts (""Novitiate”) has put together a great ensemble who deliver the goods despite a slippery script which fluffs over...legal questions...its best element just might be Athie in a breakout role as the quiet legal digger behind the star power."
4052,1,"Even so, for a story whose every beat, every cross examination and every smoking gun lands more or less where you’d expect, “The Burial” is remarkable in the way it gradually excavates its central idea:"
4053,1,… a genuine feel good movie …
4054,1,"Erin Brockovich, Just Mercy and even My Cousin Vinny are some of the touchstones for this feelgood courtroom drama that never delivers a single unexpected beat yet remains irrepressibly entertaining."
4055,1,"Even though it has a sense of humour and a healthy interest in the racial dimensions of the Mississippi-based trial, the script suffers from a basic courtroom-drama problem: too much talk, not enough variety."
4056,1,It's a tremendously satisfying film...
4057,1,A rousing good time of a movie.
4058,0,Is it too much to ask that a film not reach for the single most obvious comedic beats or dusty homilies... Betts isn’t especially concerned with nuance or subverting expectations; everything here is a slow pitch straight down the middle of the plate.
4059,1,"Loosely based on an actual 1999 case documented in The New Yorker, the rousing David v. Goliath courtroom drama has the solidity and sting of a John Grisham adaptation."
4060,1,"The Burial is lightweight and fun, with winning performances and upsetting observations regarding race and social class"
4061,1,The Burial is dramatic yet also funny. It works because it isn’t afraid to be “inspired by” the story’s actual people and isn’t just content to retell the events of this little-known but highly consequential civil court case.
4062,1,You’ll see exactly what The Burial is doing but you’ll fall for it anyway.
4063,1,"It is the vibrancy to the presentation that remains the standout though the performances are also good fun. In particular, Gladstone once again shows she can inhabit any character and make them feel like someone you've known for a lifetime."
4064,1,"Quantum Cowboys is truly a piece of “you just have to see it to get it” cinema. It’s stunning animation, it is sophisticated storytelling, it is a mind bender that will have you on the edge of sensory overload."
4065,1,The textured layers in the visuals matched the complex and straight through narrative that grounded the experience of creating and consolidating memories.
4066,1,"Initially disorienting, its eclectic visuals grew on me, leading to a captivating experience. A multiverse Western that offers a thought-provoking, cosmic adventure through time and space."
4067,1,"Quantum Cowboys looks and feels starry nightly and colorful, imaginative to no limit."
4068,1,"Due to its gentle nature and familiar Western gear, Quantum Cowboys is one of the best entry-level trip movies ever made."
4069,1,"Quantum Cowboys has a big cast, with a variety of personalities, and what it all becomes is a fascinating, and even brilliant new western that colors outside the lines of what the genre has typically offered."
4070,1,"Mixes together animation, the Western genre, and quantum mechanics for a trippy film that defies comprehension."
4071,1,"It is the vibrancy to the presentation that remains the standout though the performances are also good fun. In particular, Gladstone once again shows she can inhabit any character and make them feel like someone you've known for a lifetime."

4102,1,"Mixes together animation, the Western genre, and quantum mechanics for a trippy film that defies comprehension."
4103,0,"Lawrence's extremely ugly film loses itself in the back half when it stops focusing on how community supports Katniss and simply becomes another arena film. The adaptation couldn't escape Collins' bad source material, but why did it have to be ~2.5 hrs?"
4104,1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 may not be remembered for its quality as a film, or even its promotion of the female-centric narrative, but the highly-engaging conclusion delivers on the promise of Suzanne Collins’ novels."
4105,1,Ultimately 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2' provides a satisfying end to the story rather than an inspiring one.
4106,1,"What comes as a shock is how the Hollywood adaptation has maintained many of the most controversial and un-commercial elements of the story, delivering a narrative with themes of terrorism, violence as entertainment, entertainment as propaganda."
4107,1,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Parts 1 and 2 make for an epic conclusion to the franchise but the second film is stronger than the first.
4108,1,"Unlike its predecessor, it has a good pace and knows how to balance political content and action. Those who read the books will get by with a good adaptation, although perhaps a little cold compared to the original story [Full review in Spanish]"
4109,1,"Mockingjay Part 2 brings a solid conclusion to a riveting series, with a wonderfully suspenseful buildup and a solid end that is sure to satisfy."
4110,1,Do a shot every time Katniss is knocked out and fights to regain consciousness and my guess is you'll be just a shell-shocked as she is by the end of the movie.
4111,0,"Even when the set designs show potential as battlegrounds of claustrophobic, mazy terrors, they're spoiled by traditional zombie hordes or video game-like deathtraps."
4112,0,It may be that everyone involved has merely grown a little bored with a limited storyline whose more intriguing elements have inevitably been eroded.
4113,1,"Any film franchise adapted from the books will never entirely satisfy everyone. But with The Hunger Games, the franchise comes to a satisfactory and epic end."
4114,0,A tedious and dour experience that fails to bring its themes together in a satisfying manner.
4115,1,"Feels like the fragment it is, but provides a satisfactory end to the larger saga."
4116,1,"If you have been faithful to the franchise, you will surely love this movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
4117,0,What we see in 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2' is the absence of emotion witnessed in the first installments of this popular franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
4118,0,The series finally concludes with the poorly named The Hunger Games: Mockingjay- Part 2.
4119,1,"[M]ay not be the best film of the franchise, and it may seem a little lackluster as an ending for a franchise as epic as this, but it serves the franchise, the books, and Katniss Everdeen well. This is the perfect ending for this legacy."
4120,1,"The Hunger Games series is one of those rare critically beloved, publicly championed occurrences that deserves admiration for its ability to entertain in a sophisticated, meaningful, intelligent way."
4121,1,"The filmmakers saved the best for last, pulling out all the stops and delivering a film that is both heart-stopping and heartbreaking."
4122,0,Sadly this final chapter is best served only to completionists.
4123,1,"There's little light to perforate the the dark here, but its relentless gritted teeth has always been The Hunger Games' greatest strength. It's also taken great care to make its characters' stakes and motivations clear throughout."
4124,1,"Mockingjay -- Part 2 serves as a decent film, but isn't necessarily the grand finale that fans are hoping for. It hits some right notes and it is an entertaining watch, but the intensity is lacking in a franchise that is built on intensity."
4125,0,"Whether you find the movie entertaining or not is a question of taste, but I predict wide audiences will find Katniss' final fight too irksome to enjoy."
4126,1,"Jennifer Lawrence is the reason the series, and ""Mockingjay Part 2"" ultimately works, building to a crowd-pleasing conclusion that wraps everything up quite nicely."
4127,1,"Now, with the conclusive The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, ardent and casual fans of this imaginative and charged film franchise will get a chance to soak in the cinematic experience that has carried them through this durable trilogy."
4128,1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a movie less than the sum of its parts, mainly because most of its parts were used to make the previous movie."
4129,1,"It still doesn't surpass Catching Fire as the high point of the franchise, but it is a noble effort."
4130,1,"Just this once, we'll agree to forgive the fact that we had to buy four movie tickets to see three films."
4131,1,Necessarily dark and disturbing.
4132,1,"An angry, uncomfortable Hunger Games is not the thing of box office records. So here we are. At the end, unsatisfied, but victorious."
4133,1,It is the mark of a great franchise that one starts to miss the hero or heroine even before they have gone.
4134,0,Katniss looked tired and emotional throughout most of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 and the tiredness was definitely contagious!
4135,0,"Mockingjay is true to the book: in the end, we're all just tired, resigned and want the bad stuff to stop."
4136,1,"This movie makes some fascinating stylistic choices, that force you to confront the personal consequences of violence and violation."
4137,0,Part 2 staggers under the weight of the source material's ambition.
4138,0,"Somewhere, a talented fan-editor will undertake the task of combining the most important bits of both films into one three-hour epic that can stand alone as the grandstanding conclusion this franchise deserved"
4139,1,Director Lawrence ... gives the other characters a greater sense of development with the result that the movie doesn't come across as a Jennifer Lawrence Glorification Vehicle.
4140,1,"Filled with genuine thrills, gripping tension and rallying hero moments galore, the trilogy comes to a close in epic fashion, befitting its bad-ass heroine."
4141,0,"How disappointing it is to report that this final instalment is by far and away the worst film in the franchise. Not only is it gloomy, dull and virtually surprise-free; it's also unforgivably cheap-looking."
4142,0,"There is no momentum in Mockingjay Part 2, as the pacing is terrible."
4143,1,"In the case of Francis Lawrence's one-two punch with Mockingjay (the concluding text of The Hunger Games series), Part 2 seeks to perfectly execute the game plan."
4144,0,"Now that we have this movie, you could skip Mockingjay 1 entirely and not miss anything but inessential pouting."
4145,1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (there, that's the last time I have to type that mouthful) has not dethroned its predecessors to take the spot of best movie in the franchise. But it is a solid action film full of memorable performances."
4146,1,"In lesser hands, Katniss's willingness to suffer for the whole world may seem like classic teen narcissism... But Lawrence possesses an astonishing ability to convey profound emotional seriousness without ever seeming to do anything."
4147,1,"Mockingjay Part 2 is a satisfying conclusion overall, with the franchise as a whole being so satisfying within the dismal dystopian YA genre that it only feels disappointing considering what has come before."
4148,0,"Mockingjay Part 2's gloomy, monotone approach makes this feel like an exhausting obligation to sit through."
4149,1,"Compared to other Young Adult adaptations the Hunger Games films are undeniably the most mature and well-acted, digging deep into the emotional and political core of the books."
4150,1,"The series-capper boasts its share of eye-popping action-movie spectacle, but like Collins' novels, it forces viewers to deal with grim losses while nailing the book's shocking climax."
4151,1,"I like that both the book and the movie ditched the action-y bombast and took Katniss' story to a quieter, more emotionally resonant place. It felt earned, given The Hunger Games has always been more about Katniss' character evolution."
4152,1,"Still a strong effort, and I respect the heck out of the filmmakers' collective efforts to maintain thematic fidelity to the overarching ideas Collins' novels deftly end up exploring."
4153,1,"iI's an enjoyable enough watch and if you've been with the series from the beginning you should go and see it to finish things off. But speaking as a fan of The Hunger Games, I don't see myself choosing to sit through it again any time soon."
4154,0,"A movie of limited intrinsic merit, and about which it's difficult to make any positive claim for its quality stronger than that it's definitely better than Mockingjay Part 1."
4155,0,When it gets to its final stretch -- the one that nothing except books or Wikipedia or other movies can prepare you for -- Mockingjay Part 2 is well-prepared for what might strike non-fans (or even some actual fans) as anticlimax.
4156,1,It takes an actress of the calibre of Jennifer Lawrence to successfully convey The Hunger Games protagonist's existential conundrum.
4157,1,Holy heck is it good.
4158,1,"For the past three falls, a new 'Hunger Games' movie has come around to remind us that so many of its elements - blockbuster franchise, YA novel adaptation, multiple films from one book - aren't inherently evil."
4159,1,Part 2 adds some much-needed adventure back into the mix.
4160,0,A series that just a few years ago seemed to bubble with personality and intrigue and depth is closed out here as coldly as possible.
4161,1,None of the film-makers in the series has worked out how to marry its smaller concerns about love and family with its larger themes of propaganda and dying for a cause.
4162,1,"Mockingjay Part 2 is one great example of the source material being respected, partially because with fans like this saga has, such allegiance is expected."
4163,1,The pace picks up as Katniss traverses a city laced with booby traps - an oil flood and a tunnel full of mutants provide the film's best action scenes.
4164,0,"Although the pace picks up, there's no sense of grandness to what is meant to be a huge finale and, actually, some may even feel underwhelmed by how the plot plays out."
4165,1,A fittingly serviceable end to a series that always had more potential than impact.
4166,1,"[The] rare blockbuster that finds a compelling middle ground between thoughtfulness and big, splashy spectacle."
4167,1,Kudos to Lawrence for helping bring a satisfactory conclusion
4168,1,A satisfying conclusion to a brilliant series of films that show us the dangers of the oligarchy.
4169,1,"In this final film, fans will get a satisfying resolution. It's an emotional and dark journey illuminated by an otherworldly performance from Jennifer Lawrence."
4170,0,I remember struggling with Suzanne Collins' final book. It didn't have the same sense of urgency and excitement. My thoughts on this movie are essentially the same.
4171,0,"I understand that YA books succeed by transposing real teen concerns into life-and-death fantasy situations, but any connection to the characters that existed by the end of 2013's Catching Fire has been stripped away by these plodding Mockingjay movies."
4172,0,"It's frustrating to watch the Jennifer Lawrence be marched from plot point to plot point, just getting things over with."
4173,1,"Part 2 feels like it has a sense of direction that was lost after the first movie, and it's enjoyably more action-heavy."
4174,1,the last hour of Hunger Games 3.2 is good enough that deeper readings of this text would actually hold water in a way that previous attempts to politicize it have failed.
4175,1,"Relentlessly bleak from the first frame, this final outing pulls no punches as white knuckle action sequences see the casualty rate rise alongside the tension."
4176,0,"While there's lots to recommend the movie, the silly premise is the only thing I could focus on for the entire 2 hours and 17 minutes -- which is inexcusably long for a movie that is actually just half of a movie."
4177,1,"In this overegged yet satisfying conclusion to the adaptation of Suzanne Collins's post-apocalyptic trilogy The Hunger Games, the body count is high, the tone at its darkest and most despairing, and nothing is sacred."
4178,1,"It reminds us that every ""happy"" ending can also be a tragedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
4179,0,"This 137 minute conclusion results heavy and drags considerably due to its lack of what it promised: Action, emotion, unrestrained rage. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4180,1,"Well, the Hunger Games finally grew up at the end, after all that silliness about the earth-shattering importance of fashion statements. We finally got one convincing romance, to go with a real battle and real politics."
4181,0,"action and theme don't always cohere, and what's good in the film too often has to be dug out from under a lot of underwhelming excess"
4182,1,"Affirms Katniss Everdeen's status as the most significant of the reluctant teen heroes who have battled adult tyranny in the fantasy movie series of the past few decades (and no, I'm not forgetting Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter)."
4183,0,"Part 2 is supposed to be the emotional crescendo to an epic love triangle, but due a complete lack of chemistry between Lawrence and her callow male co-stars, it's all hollow, and the gold-embossed Super Happy Ending feels fraudulent. D.B."
4184,1,"So much better than last year's plodding, aimless Part 1."
4185,1,"Mockingjay Part 2 is a worthy conclusion to Katniss' saga with great, epic moments. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4186,1,"If anything is certain beyond the wavering quality of this series, it's that it has always remained focused on the immense strength of its very dedicated heroine."
4187,1,It's a fitting finale to a much-loved franchise.
4188,1,It's the second best film in the series.
4189,0,"It could have been a better, riskier, more interesting movie. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4190,0,"The freshness of the concept is now gone, and the slick finale doesn't stand on its own."
4191,1,I think that Mockingjay - Part 2 is not a bad movie. It's just more of the same. [Full review in Spanish]
4192,0,"The conclusion to the Hunger Games franchise ends up being a completely anticlimatic, boring, and worthy of a soap opera finale. [Full review in Spanish]"
4193,1,A great ending for one of the most enjoyable franchises in recent time. [Full review in Spanish]
4194,1,A grand finale for the series in which the characters deal with the spiritual question: What is the truth?
4195,1,"A fitting ending to a strong series, this final chapter offers the action that audiences would hope for and the emotional climax that fans deserve."
4196,0,"In the last chapter of this overhyped saga, the plot drags too much and rushes to solve all the loose ends. [Full review in Spanish]"
4197,1,Fans of the series will see it come to a satisfying end. [Full review in Spanish]
4198,0,It's pretty obvious this last book could've been reduced to a single film. [Full review in Spanish]
4199,1,This is marginally better than the first Mockingjay installment simply as there isn't all the endless stage-setting and self-important yakking.
4200,1,"As wobbly as Mockingjay - Part 2 is, it's powerful because its characters and conflicts have become so familiar in the culture, and because it completes a long and painful journey."
4201,1,"Mockingjay is a lengthy demonstration packed with more grief and soul searching than fun, to some readers' dismay... Yet it's hard not to admire the chutzpah of a heroic epic that debunks everything about heroes and epics."
4202,1,"I prefer the second movie, but The Hunger Games is something to see as a whole. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4203,1,Saw X is probably one of the best Saw films in over ten years and has rejuvenated and refreshed the series.
4204,1,"This is the best sequel of the bunch, and it may end up sitting at the top of the franchise. Beyond the shocking moments, this gives us the best John Kramer we have seen yet. Tobin Bell is brilliant."
4205,1,"Despite being a little too long it does keep the momentum going for the most part, making this the most satisfying Saw movie since Saw VI."
4206,1,"Once the blood begins to flow, Saw X tears ahead with brutal, surgical precision and typically excellent practical effects."
4207,1,"The path that Saw X traveled to become the best-ever Saw movie was short, brightly-lit, well-marked and so obvious... make Tobin Bell the protagonist."
4208,1,…drills down on the nasty-ass cruelty that the Saw sequence seems to be all about…
4209,1,"Three movies after a movie erroneously dubbed the ""final chapter"" in this franchise, we get a surprise: a 'Saw' movie that's actually good (the best since the 2004 original)."
4210,0,"Saw X is by far the most thoughtful movie in the franchise! Of course, that’s like saying it’s the least smelly in a surfeit of skunks."
4211,0,This is the series' best entry since its original of 2004 (which is not saying much)
4212,0,"It doesn’t add much to the overall series, and its lamentable attempt to imbue Jigsaw with a heart proves as misguided as the killer’s holier-than-thou agenda."
4213,1,"Saw X delivers the most personal & bloodiest entry to date, easily making it the best Saw movie sequel & proving there's still life in this franchise."
4214,1,"This time, it’s all about Jigsaw and his story and God knows, deep down, he is just like any of us - flawed, vulnerable, victimised and often quite unreasonable as well."
4215,0,"He claims he’s set up situations in which they torture themselves, but this is just as much baloney as some of the comically hypocritical heartwarming moments involving Mr. Jigsaw with people he actually cares about. It’s like watching Hitler pet a dog."
4216,0,The core premise of Saw X is at direct conflict with the underlying foundation of the franchise.
4217,1,John Kramer reminds us why we fell in love with Saw in the first place. Saw X allows us to live in the world of the icon a little bit longer.
4218,1,"Newcomers need not apply, but for fans: Saw X is a wonderful reminder of just how good the franchise can be when it's firing on all cylinders. It's the best sequel the franchise has had in over 10 years."
4219,1,"Saw X proves that there's still plenty of life left in the franchise with a prequel focusing on John Kramer's relationship with Amanda. As gory as the traps are, it's Synnøve Macody Lund who steals the show; what a fantastic villain!"
4220,0,Audiences come to these movies specifically to see characters die in Kramer’s contraptions. True suspense is never generated because it’s a foregone conclusion they will be maimed.
4221,0,"Saw X biggest achievement is making you care for the main villain during the first act. But good things never last and due to a bland script and a noticeable low budget for such a popular franchise, things end up being pretty much as always, no surprises."
4222,1,"Tries to be a little different with differing results. It does eventually tie into the rest of the franchise with death, torture and gore and that is what the fans want at the end of the day."
4223,1,Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) is the best part of this franchise. Why did it take you so long to make a movie centered around him?!
4224,0,"X frames Kramer like a tragic hero instead of a complete maniac with a thing for Rube Goldberg homicide, and swears by the wobbly moral mechanism he believes will balance his soul’s ledger."
4225,1,Saw X is a treat to the franchise fans but a strict warning to others as this gorefest can make your stomach churn and might haunt you for a long time.
4226,1,"Saw X is a film that only works because it’s the 10th film in the franchise. This story could not have been told by the second or third Saw movie; if this movie were to exist at all, it could only come now, and the franchise is better off for it."
4227,1,"Saw X not only returns the series to its roots, it refines them."
4228,1,Quite possibly the best film in the franchise since the first one. It's perfect timing for Halloween and a good way to end the series on a high note after ups and many downs - if that's what's really going on here.
4229,0,"Saw X delivers on its premise of eye-popping gore and elaborate torture traps, but its attempt to deliver a more grounded setup feels misplaced and the twists lack some of the cleverness found in the earlier installments."
4230,1,'Saw X' really has teeth.
4231,1,"[Saw X] finds Bell back on form as a psycho who is here unambiguously, a vigilante hero doing horrid things to people who really, really deserve it."
4232,1,"Yes, this is still a series with characters sneaking around in pig masks and elaborate games that aren’t exactly playing fair. With that said, when it’s done well, I can’t argue with the results. This is easily one of the best entries in the series."
4233,0,"A lengthy running time is the only difference between this and other disappointing ""Saw"" sequels of late. In that sense, the franchise's longest installment is its most punitive."
4234,0,"Coupled with the bizarrely ill-judged attempt at sentimentality and the fact the traps themselves are dull and nonsensical, there’s really nothing to recommend this movie to anyone besides those who've already been converted by Kramer’s words and actions."
4235,1,"Remarkably, this tenth addition to the Saw canon is actually the best of the lot."
4236,1,The man who says he helps people overcome personal obstacles also engineers the games that might lead to their demise. This continuance/prequel shows there’s creative meat to the bone regarding the dubious nature of what that story means.
4237,1,"In a time where ""elevated horror"" seems to dominate the genre, it's refreshing to see a film that revels in the simple. [Full review in Spanish]"
4238,1,"While Saw X cannot deliver the jaw-dropping twists and creative traps that were the hallmark of prior installments in the franchise, it succeeds thanks to an emotional storyline made all the better by Tobin Bell’s best performance of the franchise."
4239,1,"As a Saw fan, this might not have been the best of the franchise but it still gave me everything I would want from a Saw film!"
4240,1,"This is a long way to go for a film that when it first came out they thought it was going to go straight to video... 10 films, a billion dollar franchise and it feels like there's the potential for even more."
4241,1,"Bell has aged across the 19 years since Saw hit our screens in 2004, and it gives a wonderful physicality to this quiet, broken man."
4242,1,"Despite its script limitations and its frequent use of stereotypes, Saw X fulfills its objective of providing entertainment, delivering a suitable weekend horror film. [Full review in Spanish]"
4243,1,"[Previous reboots] both failed to grasp Kramer’s star power. Saw X does not make that mistake, leading to one of the franchise’s strongest installments since the original, mostly because it gives Jigsaw center stage."
4244,1,For fans of the saga and lovers of very raw red meat. [Full review in Spanish]
4245,1,(Kevin) Greutert and company tell a tight and well-structured story built firmly around a riveting Tobin Bell performance.
4246,0,"Saw X treats us like we’re idiots, but given that we all paid money for this movie, I suppose we are."
4247,0,"Why in the heck is this ridiculously stupid movie getting so many good reviews? Our standards as a society have fallen, and Shawnee Smith's wig is awful."
4248,0,The deadly games and contraptions this time round simply lack fresh ideas.
4249,1,"It’s a fine horror movie. It’s a good Saw installment. But it pales compared to Talk to Me, or even the latest Evil Dead film."
4250,0,"In the end, Sax X renounces all possibilities of leaving the audience speechless and leads to a ridiculous telenovela-like resolution.  [Full review in Spanish]"
4251,1,"On a storytelling level there’s nothing else in Saw X, other than the plot as an excuse to give fans the splatterfest they desire."
4252,1,"Combining terrific performances, thorough character development and plenty of gut-wrenching gore, Saw X becomes the best sequel of the franchise to date."
4253,1,"[Tobin Bell's] half-cracked grandeur, boosted by [Shawnee] Smith’s skewed stares of adoration, sends the movie into a loopy giddiness. Saw X may not be the best one to start off with, but it’s hard to imagine a better one to end with."
4254,1,"While audiences may flock to SAW X for its infamous traps and gore, they’ll be surprised to find something full of emotion, rich character expansion, and an impressive story that puts Tobin Bell in the spotlight he deserves."
4255,1,It's pretty wild that SAW X is one of the first films in the series that got it right for me. The plot points are still pretty stupid and the traps are implausibly manufactured but Tobin Bell getting the spotlight really classes this thing up.
4256,1,"It might not be the crown jewel of the franchise, but it's a solid outing. If you're in for a mix of gore, thrills, and ethical conundrums, Saw X is your ticket."
4257,1,"Cheekily assuming anyone is nostalgic for the heyday of the 'torture porn' sub-genre, Saw X functions as a period piece."
4258,0,Saw X falls into the same old torture trap.
4259,1,A strong contender for the best of the Saw sequels...
4260,1,"It’s thoroughly unpleasant, but that’s rather the point."
4261,1,"For the most part, Saw X is a satisfying change of pace for the series. It is nowhere near as great as the original 2004 film, which was so surprising and fresh in its day, but it is the best of the sequels we have gotten."
4262,1,"Yet, having the chance to see Tobin Bell take a more active role in the narrative is a delight, and what results is a high point for this franchise."
4263,0,If it wasn't for the screaming -- some of it more convincing than others -- I swear I'd have dozed off before this hit the halfway mark.
4264,1,"The original Let’s Make a Deal host of torture returns, Tobin Bell as John Kramer aka Jigsaw, who restores a pulse to the lifeless franchise. Bell shines in the additional screen time making his character more human. The carnage and tension excessive"
4265,0,"Though Greutert attempted to deliver a horror movie with drama and gravitas, Saw X is ultimately much more of the same, and it suffers from an unearned and ill-advised attempt at making the Jigsaw Killer a saviour. Admirable but, in the end, unsatisfying."
4266,0,"None of this is helped by Greutert’s direction, which is roughly as lazy as everything else here, nor by the fact that the traps are objectively the least clever of the entire series."
4267,1,Saw X is not only a beautifully bloody and gripping horror picture but also the best one out of the bunch.
4268,1,"This gets back to the basics! Having Jigsaw as the lead, makes it 10x more personal and frankly more compelling. Its flawed but it's easily one of the best entries in the franchise, with simplify making it a character driven story."
4269,1,"Saw X doesn’t have the mind-blowing shock of the original film. But, with inventive deaths that will make viewers’ faces and extremities cringe in horror, it’s a great—even occasionally funny—addition to the franchise."
4270,1,While still VERY bloody & twisted. The personal John Kramer story added so much emotion & depth that the franchise lacked.
4271,1,Provides a throwback style and a more fleshed out story for Jigsaw’s background that breathes some new life into the struggling franchise.
4272,1,"Saw X wipes that silliness out, positioning itself as a direct sequel to ""Saw"" and presenting a singular, streamlined story of revenge that works from a clear channel of logic."
4273,1,"Saw X is hands (tied) down the best instalment from the franchise in years thanks to deviously demented twists, gore galore and a surprisingly hearty helping of humour."
4274,1,"Set between Saw and Saw II, the tenth instalment of the torture-porn franchise amazingly hasn’t run out of steam."
4275,0,Saw X lapses into overblown scenes of silliness that end up looking tired rather than terrifying. Read less
4276,1,"It has everything you want from a solid Saw sequel: brilliant and brutal traps, a game involving multiple players, and a deep resentment of the capitalist machinery that keeps us simultaneously oppressed by and dependent upon the turning of its wheels."
4277,1,"This Saw is interested in spending quality time with its protagonist, while playing with the conventions of the saga to the point of strengthening its affable sense of humor, humanizing everyone. [Full review in Spanish]"
4278,1,"Surprisingly, Saw X is actually a terrific entry in this nineteen-year-old franchise. It gives you all the blood, guts and cringe-inducing effects you expect from a Saw movie."
4279,1,"When it seemed there wasn't anything to invent, this brand new ""game” finds in its essence the elements that made it unique, and redefines them with honesty grounded in its lore. [Full review in Spanish]"
4280,1,"Saw X is one of the strongest films in the franchise, giving us more of an insight into the man behind Jigsaw and his renewed purpose."
4281,1,"A serious actor, Bell surely knows this bloody franchise will be what he’s best remembered for, and he treats the role of John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, like it’s Shakespeare."
4282,1,"It’s torture-forward, funny, preposterous, imaginative and puts into practice what the franchise should have learned a long, long time ago: There is no reason to reinvent the saw blade."
4283,1,"One of the reasons I've always liked John Kramer as a character... is he's always had a moral code. His tactics are absolutely brutal, but he's a man with a code, and I can respect. that but Saw X expands on that."
4284,1,"Saw X is quite refreshing because we get a very ""alive"" John Kramer, a set of victims that get what that very much deserve, and the return of Shawnee Smith (one of my favorite characters)."
4285,1,"I haven’t squirmed this bad in a movie theater in I don’t know how long. Director Kevin Greutert, and writers Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger go back to basics, delivering ingenious death traps and an engaging narrative that keeps things simple."
4286,1,Saw X feels like a welcome return to form.
4287,1,"Bloody, hilarious, and audaciously sentimental for something so schlocky."
4288,1,Saw X only works because it can carry the unspoken weight of the entire Jigsaw Saga on its back and use it as a constant winking reference to longtime fans.
4289,0,"Inevitably, the movie falls into the same unpleasant hole as its predecessors."
4290,1,"“Saw X” solves a lot of the problems of other films in this franchise by limiting its scope, eliminating some (but not all) of the incoherent plotting [and] coming up with a few ingenious traps."
4291,1,A more linear and structured story than previous installments.
4292,1,"As tenth instalments to horror franchises go, this is undoubtedly one of the best, comfortably delivering the horror staples of the series in a way that won’t leave fans disappointed."
4293,1,This is the most well-groomed “Saw” movie to date. The story mostly makes sense and Greutert pulls back on the frenetic editing techniques that made the older movies look like the blood and guts equivalent of white noise.
4294,1,"Kramer’s return may be bad news to his victims, but for the rest of us? Playing his new game is a heck of a lot more fun than it has any right to be."
4295,1,"Saw X is a solid, grotesquely fun installation renewing life in a presumed dead series, shading in aspects of its most complex and morally deranged characters"
4296,1,Allows for a tighter focus on the series’ most popular character without all of the narrative trickery latter films needed to keep him relevant storywise.
4297,1,"Is it a bit baggy and less amusingly chaotic than past entries? Absolutely. However, Bell's return as this character is still grimly fun when he's given room to let loose. Even as time isn't always on his side, he makes the most of nearly every moment."
4298,1,Saw X is exactly what I’ve wanted from SAW since the very first one. A perfect in between film for the franchise that lays out so many possibilities.
4299,0,"Saw X is a bloody, boring slog through basic brutality"
4300,1,"A decent “Saw” installment is something of a cinematic miracle, and while it ends winded, “Saw X” is at least halfway functional and winningly attentive to its lead character."
4301,1,"Saw X is a fun return to form for the series, even when it’s a little confused about what it wants to say."
4302,1,"It’s not the reawakening it may want to be, but for fans of the franchise, it’s finally an installment worth watching."
4303,0,Here's a film that is offensive only in how inoffensive it proves to be.
4304,0,Feels like an elegantly made - the cinematography and score are top notch - night time soap opera.
4305,0,"At least, the film goes out of the way to show the use of condoms."
4306,0,"If this is love, no thanks."
4307,0,"In terms of story and character, this film is in desperate need of a safe word."
4308,1,"Overlong, too clinical in design, and based on lowest common denominator entertainment (or so I'm told), Fifty Shades of Grey still manages to be engaging, funny, and unexpectedly human."
4309,1,"Given that this is her second film, [Sam] Taylor-Johnson directs the film with taste and care by focusing on the interactions between Ana and Christian rather than the sexual side of the story and the film looks stunning."
4310,0,"Fifty Shades of Grey will draw you in out of curiosity and possibly hopes of a good movie, then leave you wondering why you agreed to such a thing in the first place, much like the main character."
4311,0,Funny that no one seemed to understand in the making of Grey that watching two vaguely defined characters engage in ceaseless rounds of conservatively filmed grimaces and stifled moans gets tiresome quickly.
4312,0,"There is little more critical than to say a third of the film had people laughing at dialogue, and the other two thirds wiggling in their seats, not from discomfort or innervation, but from boredom."
4313,0,You've seen worse; you've imagined better.
4314,0,"Nice as it looks, this movie tastes bad..."
4315,0,"Most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night HBO, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the erotic-charged hype surrounding the film."
4316,0,You would've put the book down after reading the character's name on the third page: Anastasia Steele? Puh-lease!
4317,0,[General audiences] might need to be handcuffed to their seats and wonder how something so wildly popular could be so stiflingly unerotic.
4318,0,Every fiber of my being is screaming at her to send this man packing.
4319,0,"The dialogue is terrible and Dornan's Grey is so humourless that any vaguely funny lines fall utterly flat. On the plus side Johnson does her best with what she's been given, Ana is a Thomas Hardy fan, and Grey has a nice kitchen."
4320,0,"The entire palate of the film was cool and gray, which doesn't do much to incite passion. and I don't think we should blame the actors."
4321,0,Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover (s)he's a cold fish between the sheets.
4322,1,"This is worth going to the cinema for, leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film."
4323,0,"Sometimes a book should just remain a book and in the case of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" that is exactly the case."
4324,0,[Fifty Shades of Grey] simply never gets anything right.
4325,0,"Among the many mind-bogglingly implausible fantasies Fifty Shades of Grey sells, the one I think that most accounts for its popularity is the promise that shame of sexual sin can be alleviated by surrendering to it more fully."
4326,0,"I'm really worried about the fact that some people (especially girls) regard Mr. Grey as an object of desire, as some sort of ideal man. [Full review in Spanish]"
4327,0,"The second half of the film devolves into something that resembles tedious, melodramatic daytime TV."
4328,0,"Grey is not a character, but a cluster of clichés... [Full review in Spanish]"
4329,0,"It's superficial, it's manipulative, it's off-putting and embarrassing. But there's no denying that this says something about the moment in which the book was published and the movie released."
4330,0,"The script is abysmally bad, filled with Shakespearean dialogue such as ""I won't touch you until I have your written consent"", and ""I don't make love, I f***... HARD"""
4331,0,"Dakota Johnson shines in this clunky, boring and domesticated sex ruse. [Full review in Spanish]"
4332,1,"There is an awful lot of rose-tinted nostalgia here for a time when women sat passively while powerful men threw wealth at them, but the interesting difference here is that the power dynamic between Red Riding Hood and the Wolf shifts."
4333,1,"Shortage of exotic shenanigans apart, artist-turned-director Sam Taylor-Johnson has delivered a decently acted and technically well-made adaptation of what remains a fundamentally silly and, at times, simply rather unpleasant story."
4334,1,"I've seen way worse movies aimed at men and boys, so I think everyone can chill out about a mediocre movie aimed at women."
4335,1,"It may not be your conventional Valentine's Day date movie, but it looks set to give audiences more pleasure than pain."
4336,0,The retention of the style of the book and its settings merges with a cinematic story more focused on buildup than execution.
4337,1,"The film's a hell of a ride, often a fun and thought-provoking one, even though it's all such camp."
4338,0,"In the run-up to [Fifty Shades of Grey]'s opening, I was surprised at the promotional efforts of NBC's ""Today"" show in the daily banter of the hosts and beyond."
4339,0,"Fifty Shades of Grey is so much smarter than its source material, but smarter in this case doesn't mean better. Not where it counts, at least."
4340,0,"Alas, I was a reluctant Dominant because the movie itself is such a mousey, uninvolving little thing that somebody had to step up."
4341,0,The most anticipated release of the year is not much more than a spanking great bore.
4342,1,"Then the lights went down, and guess what? Fifty Shades of Grey turned out to be not just entertaining-at least until the clunky, exasperating final minute-but it also knows exactly what it's doing."
4343,0,Not as dirty as we were led to believe by the ads.
4344,0,Girls memorize the lines! But it's not a 'Rocky Horror' type cultural event; it's a lukewarm soft-core-porn soap opera-basically 'Pretty Woman' with spanking.
4345,0,I wish it had either been much better or much worse.
4346,0,"In the lacking of an engaging subjectivity, the narrative of sexual awakening falls flat."
4347,0,"While the film is arguably no better or worse than its literary source, it does shatter the fantasies of sexual desire and sexual pleasure constructed within the novel."
4348,0,"A guilty, if not particularly memorable, pleasure."
4349,1,"Funny (often intentionally!), ferociously unsexy, and roundly entertaining from beginning to end."
4350,0,"It's a warped, disturbingly abusive adult fairy tale from start to finish."
4351,0,"Certainly there is an audience out there for this kind of story, and with any luck neither you nor I will ever have to interact with it."
4352,0,This is a wannabe tragedy (with whips) about the knightly failure to commit to the maiden's romantic narrative.
4353,1,"Fifty Shades of Grey delivers, however ponderously, on its promise of pop transgressiveness."
4354,0,"Ultimately, Fifty Shades of Grey spends two hours describing a relationship that is bound to fail and doesn't even seem all that fun while it's occurring."
4355,1,"Fortunately the two leads have real chemistry. Dornan makes Christian less creepy and more angsty than on the page and Johnson brings a surprising depth to Anastasia. They also know how to play certain scenes for laughs, making the film come alive."
4356,1,"Let's talk about Dakota Johnson... she's the perfect blend of innocence and confidence; a stealthy heart-breaker who at first comes across as mousey and innocent, but suddenly and convincingly becomes confident and coquettish."
4357,0,I was more aroused by the immaculate shine on Christian's piano than anything in his boudoir of bondage: a set designer must have spent hours buffing those ivories.
4358,0,"Rather than anything to do with sexual connoisseurship or philosophy in the bedroom, all that comes across through Fifty Shades of Grey's absence of erotic heat is a lust for the appurtenances of luxury, something that's more commonplace than singular."
4359,0,"It's cheap, misogynist, Z grade exploitation masquerading as the romance of a woman trying to tame the ultimate man, who by all accounts should be alone left to his own demented fantasies"
4360,1,"It's not overstating the case to say that Dakota Johnson achieves stardom with this role. She mines moments of humor that help offset the soul-searching and weeping, and she's appealing without being impossibly beautiful."
4361,0,"This movie is a mess. It's glacially slow, boasts a laughably clichéd soundtrack -- Beast Of Burden, anyone? -- and is plainly a cash-grabbing set-up to promote a full trilogy."
4362,0,"Yes, there's tons of nudity, but erotic? No."
4363,1,This alien quality is what makes Dornan so effective as Christian.
4364,0,"Fifty Shades of Grey is one of the landmark works of the new millenium, the novel that proved definitively Americans will suffer through anything for a few fleeting moments of titillation."
4365,0,"One day, it may become a bad movie/cult classic -- the kind of film that people go to laugh at, like Showgirls. But for now, it's so boring it feels endless."
4366,0,The film is about the best adaptation that could have been drawn from this rather dull source material -- at least until it slows to a crawl on the deathly serious and dull home stretch.
4367,1,Unexpectedly delightful.
4368,0,"It was less terrible than I feared, but still fell well short of being good."
4369,0,"When Christian sweeps the demure Anastasia off her feet and into his world of penthouse-and-helicopter luxury and sadomasochistic sex, what lies in store is two hours-plus of glossy tedium."
4370,0,"There's a really funny, sexy comedy here that might have been wonderful, were it not also stuck with being an adaptation of this loathsome novel."
4371,0,"Both actors are trapped by the rigid banality of their characters, and they fail to manufacture any chemistry -- without that heat, this is just a story about a contract negotiation."
4372,0,"When you take a close look at Fifty Shades of Grey, it becomes painfully clear that it's basically a plethora of sex scenes strung together with a bare minimum of support."
4373,0,It's pretend bondage. Caffeine-free Diet BDSM.
4374,0,"It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but in this case, only because this movie is better than its source material doesn't mean it's good."
4375,0,"If they added foreboding opening and closing monologues by David Duchovny, the whole thing could easily be mistaken for a long-lost episode of Red Shoe Diaries."
4376,0,"Johnson brings some wonder and vulnerability to her part, but even with a listenable soundtrack, the song that most comes to mind is Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There Is?"""
4377,1,"Grey may be crass and calculated, but Johnson saves it from being completely forgettable."
4378,1,"Without the baggage of having read the book, the synopsis or even the film's Wikipedia page, Fifty Shades of Grey unspools as a surprisingly engaging story about sexual naivety, concepts of consent and, ultimately, power."
4379,1,"Actress Dakota Johnson brings humor, sensitivity and vulnerability to Anastasia, making her the clear breakout performance of Fifty Shades [of Grey]."
4380,0,A monumentally boring motion picture.
4381,0,"Who would have thought, a Twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration."
4382,1,"... isn't nearly as terrible as E.L. James' novel would make you expect. There's perverted, like the sado-masochistic sex games played by tycoon Christian Grey, and then there's perverse, like the pleasure of watching trash so glossily compacted."
4383,0,"Basically, they made a lousy, mid-2000s-era Katherine Heigl romance with a handful of explicit sex scenes spliced throughout the familiar clichés."
4384,0,A syrupy softcore melodrama with perhaps too much dialogue.
4385,0,My biggest grip with the film was that I didn't find the two leading characters all that interesting.
4386,0,"He's a wealthy tycoon named Gray who takes a woman to her limits. I'm talking, of course, about '9 1/2 Weeks.'"
4387,0,Perhaps it's time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades - and that they're not real.
4388,0,"One suspects that Taylor-Johnson was never free even to push at the edges of sexual representation, and the film's lack of explicit imagery and grit is one of its disappointments."
4389,1,What emerges in Fifty Shades of Grey is perhaps the best finished product that could rise from the depths of a compromised starting point.
4390,1,Taylor-Johnson has made a film that is both sexy and stylish.
4391,0,"I fault no one for whatever it is that gets their crank turning, but if this movie is working you need to take that thing out for a spin far more often."
4392,0,"It's a bondage movie without much perversion, a love story without much passion, and ultimately, a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill. It never quite hits as hard as you want it to."
4393,0,I can only say that boredom set in early.
4394,0,"While there's some meat to Dakota Johnson's role of the ingenue, Jamie Dornan is given absolutely nothing to work with for most of the film."
4395,0,"In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't so much terrible as it is timid and tame."
4396,0,"The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit."
4397,0,"What is this thing called love? That's a question asked by Cole Porter. In 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query: 'What are butt plugs?'"
4398,0,Oh...my...god.
4399,0,"Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation gets so caught up in the intrigue and melodrama that it never really finds its groove. Even the film's raw sex appeal is lacking, which just leaves a poorly plotted story and laughable dialogue."
4400,0,...a lukewarm exercise in timidity that - if not exactly embarrassed by its subject matter - is extremely wary of diving too deeply into it.
4401,1,"""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" which gingerly crosses over into the questionable subject mark, may not be the film some of the book's readers were hoping to witness."
4402,0,There is a very good chance that I will see nothing worse all year. I'm pretty sure I will see nothing more brain-witheringly stupid and boring -- or less sexy.
4403,0,An anthropomorphic immigrant romance combines into a mixed metaphorical mess... a Pixar film built on “plussing” instead of being enhanced by it... hoping the rapid fire nonsense will gloss over the lack of cohesion.
4404,0,"Pixar always had something new up its collective artistic sleeve. And yet here they are, coming out with a film as dull-witted and syrupy as Elemental."
4405,1,"Stunning animation sparks this cross-cultural, high-concept 'Romeo & Juliet' romantic comedy, inspired by the periodic chart of elements that one recalls from science class."
4406,1,Elemental is a marvel of layered animation techniques that float through that uncanny valley between 2D and 3D. It’s hard to discern the physical set pieces from those created in a computer and that lends an edge of realism.
4407,0,"""Trying to make a character out of a cloud"" is a sadly apt metaphor for this whole doomed endeavor."
4408,1,"Together, with the thematic elements and execution of the ideas, ""Elemental"" goes beyond tear-inducing, reaching soul-shaking. Absolutely the surprise film of 2023."
4409,1,"Water, Fire, Earth, and Air are like ethnic inhabitants of distinctive neighborhoods in this imaginatively designed Element City, with the Periodic Table-like skyline.  But the story line gets heavy-handed about immigrants and accepting different folks."
4410,1,"Elemental does reward a big screen experience, and its message about love, self-determination, and community is relevant and welcome."
4411,1,"This Pixar movie doesn’t rekindle the studio’s old magic, but it’s no washout either."
4412,1,"Visually, the film generally makes up for its dubiously executed premise and underwhelming conflict resolution – it had better, considering the $200 million budget."
4413,1,"Elemental is an experience for the big screen for the whole family. It’s dreamy, surreal and magically entertaining without a moment of dullness. Do not miss it for the world."
4414,1,"The theme of romance between opposite beings is intertwined with the issue of immigration, with which many can identify. [Full review in Spanish]"
4415,1,The pieces of Elemental go together just like the blending of hydrogen and oxygen to create water.
4416,1,"Visually, Elemental is stunning — the way Ember and Wade have been brought to life is an eye-popping intersection of technology and imagination."
4417,1,"Elemental may be straightforward and predictable, but it's so thematically rich and features such emotionally relatable characters that, by the end, I found myself fighting back tears."
4418,0,The film's premise is remarkably surface-level and never dives into a more profound meaning beyond apparent comparisons to other Disney-led projects.
4419,1,"Elemental is a very endearing movie that tackles themes such as generational burdens, parental expectations, honoring legacy but also shows how to create and chasing your own dreams. It’s Pixar first real swing at a romcom, and the love story works."
4420,0,"Elemental feels like Pixar is taking its titular term to heart in the worst way, making for rudimentary rather than particularly ravishing or resonant viewing."
4421,1,"Elemental has enough depth for adults, creativity for children, and a searing romance that succeeds only when other aspects take a backseat."
4422,0,"The film’s unconventional romance-comedy-inspired story fails to light the torch of its emotional core, leaving the audience in a state of wanting more."
4423,1,Elemental is certainly one of those films that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Perhaps it doesn’t have the humor that many would expect from a Pixar film but it does have a thought-provoking storyline.
4424,1,The choice to present Wade as the catalyst for Ember’s growth devalues her strength and independence.
4425,1,Elemental is a special kind of animated movie that reminds us why PIXAR is one of the best. A Love story that fills your heart with emotions and your body with joy! Hilarious too! This film speaks volumes on so many themes & knocks them out of the part!
4426,0,"Nonetheless, the story isn't at the stature of the visuals; it's as if its initial concept doesn't quite live up to its potential and the story remains, as the title, elemental. [Full review in Spanish]"
4427,1,"The allegories may be heavy-handed, but the adorable central romance is so well done and the visuals are so sumptuous that any shortcomings quickly melt away."
4428,1,"Elemental is a movie for the whole family as only Pixar knows how to make it: with distinct layers for all ages with a mature, nostalgic, and sad touch for the oldest. [Full review in Spanish]"
4429,1,"It’s no Toy Story or Nemo, nor does it challenge like Turning Red, but it’s still a reassuring hug of a film. And, for that reason alone, it deserves an audience."
4430,1,Gentle and humane but never raw or vulnerable.
4431,0,"It wants to be a reflection on social inequality, but the mocking tone, almost a joke, disengages any hint of criticism or depth. [Full review in Spanish]"
4432,0,"Elemental has all the hallmarks of a committee-led, box-ticking fiasco."
4433,0,"It’s all just ‘fine’, and for a studio that has widened the emotional horizons of what animation can achieve, that doesn’t quite cut it."
4434,1,"A mock of a great Pixar movie, saved by romance. [Full review in Spanish]"
4435,1,"... The film rallies for a superb tearjerker climax that sends you out on a high and allows you to forget the slightly overcomplicated, rather uneven movie you have just watched."
4436,1,"It is tough to compete against the past of studio that made its mark from its very first movie, but this is not a forgettable film. Elemental compensates that it does not reinvent the wheel with a lot of heart and emotion. [Full review in Spanish]"
4437,1,"Doesn’t come close to usurping Sohn's ""The Good Dinosaur"" as the studio’s worst film, but it doesn’t exactly challenge ""Inside Out"" for the top spot, either."
4438,1,"Ember looks like she isn’t just a plastic figure covered in fire; no, with this animation, Ember is pure fire — and so is the movie surrounding them."
4439,0,"While much of this could exist as a companion to “Zootopia,” director Peter Sohn shies away from the stereotypes that made that film work."
4440,1,"There are tonal parallels with Pixar’s Inside Out and Zootropolis, but while it has a peppy visual energy, Elemental lacks the wildly inventive storytelling of the former and the laughs of the latter."
4441,0,"despite some charming animation, the movie fizzles where it should pop, weighted by an overstuffed story that works much too hard."
4442,1,"Obviously there’s wider meaning to this elemental love story, and moments of family-friendly fun."
4443,0,"But it is clever rather than charming, an animation to admire, not adore. It has all the right elements, in more ways than one. But unlike the greatest Pixar films, it never made my heart sing."
4444,1,"A bit like Inside Out meets Zootropolis – but not as fully worked out as either – it’s a movie of lovely, radiant moments."
4445,1,"Beneath the surface of the film is a powerful story about immigration, discrimination and self-acceptance, but it gets lost in the sea of other, lesser plot points."
4446,0,"Busy, zany and sincere, the movie does a perfectly good job with the stuff of urban culture clash. But it is also fatally unfunny, and gets more so with every weird contrivance it whips up."
4447,0,The problem is that there’s not enough storytelling muscle here for the allusion to really land.
4448,0,"Surely a reality where the elements are in charge should be more inventive, not limited by the trappings of capitalism and gender norms?"
4449,1,…clued-in enough to make adults and kids think a little about their own potential for prejudice…
4450,1,There are many parts to Elemental that will entertain and divert; there’s just nothing here that’s particularly memorable.
4451,0,Shockingly formulaic.
4452,0,"It’s a civics lesson in search of a story and, sadly, the story it settles on isn’t all that engaging."
4453,1,"It would be very easy to say that Elemental is too elemental, and we wouldn't be far off the mark, but the sauce used on the familiar dish does add a special flavor. [Full review in Spanish]"
4454,1,"Elemental is overstuffed and inconsistent — but packed with enough moving sentiment, gorgeous design and punchy voice performances to mean it still burns bright."
4455,1,"A sweet, charming little rom-com that touches on family, legacy and dreams. Fantastic world design, clever play with the elements and great chemistry between leads. One of the better Pixar offerings in recent memory {Full review in Spanish]"
4456,0,Elemental feels like a bad ­animated remake of My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
4457,1,A movie that encourages kids to be open-minded needed to be laid on our culturally divided doorsteps. Peter Sohn should take a bow.
4458,1,"While there are problems with the story, the artwork is excellent. There is a lot of visual imagination on display here. While the elements of air and earth get little attention, the elements of water and fire are given lavish attention."
4459,1,The details of it are really beautiful.
4460,1,"A good, B+ Pixar movie. All the elements are there for a great film, but they just need some rejiggering, reconfiguring, and trimming."
4461,0,"The installment has some funny passages, but in the end it is somewhat bland. [Full review in Spanish]"
4462,1,"I just hope that ""Elemental"" manages to find its audience, since it is a story worth watching, which strives to connect with the viewer through endearing characters, valuable messages, and a spectacular technical flair.  Full review in Spanish."
4463,1,Pixar’s first full-blown romantic comedy is lovely. It’s not subtle with its fire and water metaphor for characters from different cultures falling for each other but it’s very heartfelt and sweet.
4464,0,"Especially coming from a studio that used to be so terrifyingly fastidious about its world-building, the internal logic of Element City is wobbly at best."
4465,1,Elemental does touchingly delve into the challenges and triumphs of being the child of refugees and growing up immersed in a culturally homogenous community. It shows both the comfort and strength of being around your own people.
4466,1,"The trailers for Elemental were terrible. Thankfully, the final product is a different story. Elemental feels like classic Pixar. A wonderful world, likable characters, plenty of emotion and enough laughs to keep both young and old audiences entertained."
4467,1,"Elemental is your standard Disney/Pixar experience. Crisp animation, punchy writing and poignant moments are all present here.   Still, Pixar is getting predictable in recent years, and Elemental can feel like an amalgamation of what came before."
4468,1,"A predictable immigrant tale with a romantic comedy jab. A few too many themes that aren't explored in the deepest ways, but it has its moments and is something fans of Pixar movies can expect to like."
4469,1,"As slight as it is, I found Elemental to be adorable."
4470,1,"All the elements look so alive and fluid. With dazzling designs, creative highlights, socio-cultural commentary and meaningful message, “Elemental” elevates itself into a whole other level, a must-watch in breathtaking living color on the big screen."
4471,0,"Watching it, I couldn’t escape the impression that I was seeing something Frankensteined together from other, better Pixar movies."
4472,1,If the story had taken a little more chances I think Elemental could have hit that next level. As it is the film works fine for what it is -- the perfect summer escape to the movies for the whole family.
4473,1,"Would I say that this is a great movie? Honestly, no. However, I’d put this one step under great and say that Elemental is very good."
4474,1,"PIXAR has done it again, this gorgeous movie teaches lessons of immigrant persistence, roadblocks, and love."
4475,1,"This candy-coloured new cartoon may be mid-tier Pixar, but even average Pixar projects can be charming."
4476,1,"Disney’s latest venture Elemental will make your heart melt, even if it’s not Pixar’s best."
4477,1,"The talented Pixar team, lead by director Peter Sohn, has created a world that's visually stunning and all kinds of fun, with crazy vehicles, creative sports, and clever ethnic/elemental-specific foods, customs and character traits. Maybe that’s enough."
4478,1,This story is certainly passable. [Full review in Spanish]
4479,1,"Elemental combines pertinent social themes with a sweet, funny and masterfully animated romance. [Full review in Spanish]"
4480,0,This just lacks the creative spark and deep connection of Soul or Turning Red.
4481,1,"It’s not among the studio’s very best, but “Elemental” is certainly a crowd-pleaser, and proof that Pixar can still deliver even when all the ingredients don’t quite come together."
4482,0,"A Pixar film that enjoys an original animation on the visual side, but whose entertainment effect evaporates like water in a story of ethnic love and cultural diversity that never ceases to be boring, tepid, and without grace. [Full review in Spanish]"
4483,0,"It is, not only for the incredible weakness of its central metaphor, the most unsound script that Pixar has ever turned into a feature film."
4484,1,"While it’s true this isn’t top-tier Pixar, it’s still high-quality family entertainment from a company with an astonishing track record."
4485,1,"Much of 'Elemental’s essence might be like a plate of home cooking for long-time fans of the studio’s releases. However, as with many of its original stories, this release shows they have more touching things to say once everything comes together."
4486,1,"Elemental will prove more entertaining for younger audience members, while leaving them with good ideas to consider."
4487,1,"Thomas Newman’s score in this film is terrific. Naturally, the visuals are as impressive as ever, as well. Those aspects are enough to make the movie good enough, but combining all of these elements still left a bit more to be desired."
4488,1,"While this might not be a masterclass of narrative originality, it does have an essential truth and humanity at its heart. That goes a long way."
4489,1,Gorgeous animation. The rom-com aspect was very cute though the emotional connection lies within the story between Ember and her father rather than with Ember and Wade. Certain storylines were left unfinished or without any payoff.
4490,1,"Elemental succeeds in telling a story of impossible love, but also a story of immigrants and their dreams, and speaks of tolerance in times of social rifts. [Full review in Spanish]"
4491,1,"These animators continue to exceed expectations visually. But with a bit more bold truth-telling, and perhaps a less constructed setting, this could have been something much more powerful."
4492,0,Pixar's strained attempt at cultural segregation struggles to give its characters depth along with metaphors that don't track with the universe's basic safety precautions. It ultimately goes for the heartstrings late but by then my heart just wasn't in it
4493,0,"It’s so depressing to watch a kids’ movie that leaves you irritated instead of happy, but unfortunately, despite all its visual splendor that’s exactly what “Elemental” does."
4494,1,"A certain sweet, unworldly idealism in Elemental survives, the keynote of optimism – and this is the flame that Pixar has to keep alive."
4495,1,Its main strength is in how beautiful looking is the animation.
4496,1,"Elemental is a lovely, if lightweight, film."
4497,1,"Elemental is great at juggling its surface love story and its deeper immigrant themes, but, oddly, it only does a passable job at getting all the, ahem, elements to work together across the whole of its runtime"
4498,1,"Despite all good intentions, Elemental is just not among the studio’s very best. As a family day out at the movies, though, the visuals may be just enough to make it a big-screen experience worth your time."
4499,0,I left Elemental thinking “why was so much of that about permits...” I shouldn’t be thinking such questions but when the narrative isn’t compelling that’s where the mind goes.
4500,1,Pixar’s first rom-com proves that a tale as old as time can still spark when told in a refreshingly creative way.
4501,1,Elemental is Pixar's boldest film yet in delivering a story that offers its own take on immigration and how it impacts relationships.
4502,1,"With so much digital technology available, you'd think it would be difficult to create a cityscape that is truly gorgeous, or astonishing, but Elemental does it."
4503,1,"The quintessential mix of Thanksgiving anxiety, Steve Martin and John Candy antics, and John Hughes’ irreverent comedy."
4504,1,"Frankly, if you’re a fan of this film, the deleted/extended scenes plus the lovely video restoration/remaster may be enough to warrant buying it immediately."
4505,1,"Where disaster after disaster can become tiring, they continue reinventing themselves up to an unexpected ending where, after so much laughter one ends up on the brink of tears.  [Full review in Spanish]"
4506,1,"As recent variations of an age-old movie genre go, it is fairly good, but somehow you hope for more from Steve Martin and John Candy."
4507,1,"It's difficult to imagine any of the filmmakers currently working in Hughes's shadow going this extra mile, let alone being so inspired or audacious in the first place."
4508,1,"Bringing two comedic geniuses, Martin and Candy, together on the big screen was a brilliant idea with obviously positive results."
4509,1,Martin is the straight man with Candy sliding into the buffoon role. It is a situation of perfect casting and great chemistry.
4510,1,"John Hughes, the master of adolescent angst, finally has grown up. Planes, Trains and Automobiles is a hilarious comedy without troubled teen-agers."
4511,1,A hilarious comedy from the 80s that holds up
4512,1,It is honestly one of the finest comedy performances of 1980s cinema.
4513,0,The movie falls into the trap of wimpy and bland sentimentality. [Full Review in Spanish]
4514,1,"Mainstream audiences should readily identify with the series of tribulations and woes that befall the Everyman Martin in this good-natured, albeit predictable comedy."
4515,1,"Led by the chemistry between Steve Martin and John Candy, John Hughes'Planes, Trains, and Automobiles remains a quintessential Thanksgiving classic."
4516,1,It's the perfect film to see on an airplane.
4517,1,A hilarious and poignant film that would prove to be particularly relevant in the upcoming years.
4518,1,"Planes,Trains and Automobiles is a very funny film."
4519,1,One of the funniest films ever made...
4520,1,"A surprisingly powerful, and incredibly funny, little movie led by two terrific performances and John Hughes' razor sharp script."
4521,1,The finest comedy screenplay John Hughes ever wrote.
4522,1,"Typically Hughes: funny, zany, silly, a little bit dull and annoying, and, eventually, a whole lot sentimental."
4523,1,"A warm, mature offering from Hughes, with Martin's restraint a perfect counterpoint to Candy's enormous (and enormously amusing) fooling around."
4524,0,Pretty dispensable.
4525,1,What distinguishes this film from others in the genre is the undercurrent of melancholy between the laughs.
4526,1,"It is, of course, always a pleasure to watch Martin's steam-gauge face register his rising internal pressures and to witness his exquisitely expressed blowoffs. But Candy offers even more insinuating delights."
4527,1,"Man versus technology has been one of the staples of screen comedy since the earliest silent days, and Hughes makes the most of the format here packing as many of the frustrations of modern life as he can into this calamitous travelog of roadside America."
4528,1,
4529,1,
4530,1,"This slapstick comedy -- with Steve Martin playing the fussy straight man -- should never have worked, but it does, and well enough to earn a place as a holiday classic."
4531,1,"There's plenty of big laughs in this odd-couple comedy, but the main characters are also given a number of human moments, which leads to an ending that's downright poignant."
4532,1,"Essentially, it's the stars' keenly observed nuances of character that make this comedy amiable enough."
4533,1,
4534,1,"As recent variations of an age-old movie genre go, it is fairly good, but somehow you hope for more from Steve Martin and John Candy."
4535,0,
4536,1,
4537,1,
4538,1,"What's amazing, especially after repeated viewings, is that both actors are playing such extremes, yet you're never annoyed by them."
4539,1,Consistently funny comedy of forced relationships.
4540,1,Will resonate with anyone who has been frustrated by the inconveniences of travel.
4541,1,"John Hughes at the peak of his powers, with two masterful comedians at theirs."
4542,1,
4543,1,
4544,1,"Planes, Trains and Automobiles showed that Hughes wasn't in fact some man-child searching for the reasons for his adulthood discontentment."
4545,1,
4546,0,"The film does have its scattered moments. But too often, the audience has as much reason as Del and Neal do to wonder where, if anywhere, they are going."
4547,1,One of the few truly funny things that both Martin and Candy did.
4548,1,A comic masterpiece that never goes out of style
4549,1,"A near-perfect comedy, featuring director John Hughes at the top of his over-sentimental game."
4550,1,The late John Candy does his best work in one of the funniest films of the '80s.
4551,1,
4552,1,"One of John Hughes finest hours, and a tour-de-force for Candy and Martin."
4553,1,
4554,1,
4555,1,"It's a great comedy, and a deeply touching one, too."
4556,0,"The film barrels along with a bumbling zeal, but it's comedy at its most predictable."
4557,1,"certainly funny, but it is also a moving story that anyone who has ever recognized his or her own shortcomings will understand"
4558,1,
4559,1,Hughes has written and directed (he also produced) a perfectly balanced comedy that squeezes every last laugh out of a concept so simple you wouldn't think it could possibly succeed.
4560,1,"Martin has some funny bits on his own, but he is repeatedly upstaged by Candy, who plays his part far more broadly but at the same time winningly."
4561,1,The script and direction by Hughes ... amount to wobbly passes that Martin and Candy turn into touchdowns anyway.
4562,1,"It's the pathos under the boisterous, noisy comedy that helps fuel its continuing popularity today."
4563,1,"It's a fine cinematic treat that doesn't demand much from a viewer, but gives back a lot, both in terms of laughter and good feeling."
4564,1,A riotously springy holiday knockabout.
4565,1,"The movies that last, the ones we return to, don't always have lofty themes or Byzantine complexities. Sometimes they last because they are arrows straight to the heart."
4566,1,"It's a fine cinematic treat that doesn't demand much from a viewer, but gives back a lot, both in terms of laughter and good feeling."
4567,1,A riotously springy holiday knockabout.
4568,1,"The movies that last, the ones we return to, don't always have lofty themes or Byzantine complexities. Sometimes they last because they are arrows straight to the heart."
4569,1,"This sports biopic disguised as a video game adaptation incorporates many of the tropes we are familiar with, but still manages to succeed at pulling the right heart strings."
4570,1,"Gran Turismo is perhaps a more basic film for Blomkamp, but a welcome reminder that his breakthrough first feature District 9 wasn’t a fluke."
4571,1,"Although the screenplay is predictable and structured in a conventional form, Neil BlonKap's performance saves the movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
4572,1,"Gran Turismo made me remember just how fun it is to play the game and made me turn it on when I got home, dreaming of being a race car driver again."
4573,1,"The story is let down by an incredibly slow start, although it just narrowly squeaks by as it crosses the finish line."
4574,1,...a rousing crowd pleaser - dented and battered perhaps - but mostly intact.
4575,1,"While not as good as two other recent car-racing movies, Ron Howard’s ‘Rush’ and James Mangold’s ‘Ford V. Ferrari,’ ‘Gran Turismo’ is still a fairly effective underdog story with some cool driving scenes."
4576,1,"The underlying message is the improbable suggestion that a video game can lead to a glamorous, exciting, well-paid profession."
4577,1,A return to form for Neill Blomkamp.
4578,1,"Neill embraces the fact that his movie is based on a game but also doesn’t limit himself to it. Gran Turismo is not ashamed of being a video game movie, and its very story is a celebration of the people who play the games."
4579,1,"It's ""Top Gun"" meets ""The Hill."" Fun and inspiring!"
4580,1,"[Race car driver Jann] Mardenborough's triumph of talent, will and perseverance is precisely the feel-good, adrenaline-pumping film audiences need to finish off the summer blockbuster season on the highest podium."
4581,0,"It is a human interest story at its heart and that's part of the problem because I really liked this guy's story, but we really don't get enough. [Full review in Spanish]"
4582,1,"The chief joy derived in “Gran Turismo,” — aside from the delight Blomkamp shows in editing together tight racing sequences — is watching Harbour tear through all the gruff-but-lovable coaching cliches and find the battered, vulnerable heart within."
4583,1,It’s a well-shot movie with racing that makes up for the ho-hum drama that unfolds off the track. There’s a certain tension to see how the stellar racing footage can pick up the slack of a rather paint-by-numbers sports biography.
4584,1,...an intriguing premise that’s employed to relentlessly uneven yet mostly entertaining effect by Neill Blomkamp...
4585,1,"What enriches the film the most, conceived under the mantra of ""based on a true story"" to make us believe the impossible, is an outsider's look at an elite tournament like GT or Formula 1. [Full review in Spanish]"
4586,0,"The level of sports movie cliché is almost overwhelming; as is the notion that this movie about a craven marketing exercise is, itself, a craven marketing exercise."
4587,0,"The result is a film that struggles to get out of second gear, with a risk of viewer fatigue setting in long before the chequered flag is in sight."
4588,1,"It's got a lot of a heart and is generally engaging throughout. It's 2 hours and 15 minutes, which I thought should be too long, but it keeps it going."
4589,1,This was much better than I expected it to be and probably better than it had any right to be.
4590,1,"GRAN TURISMO has its blemishes, even beyond its formula, but on the whole its affecting and heartwarming."
4591,0,"Anyone who continues to use Days of Thunder as a punchline while praising this one should find themselves reevaluating the latter because this is basically the same movie subtract a charismatic lead, some good lines and anything resembling engaging."
4592,1,A true story captured on screen with brilliance.
4593,0,"Perhaps if Blomkamp had chosen to be a little more straight-forward with his visual story telling, Gran Turismo could have worked. As it is, it proves to be a missed opportunity -- a film that basically is middle of the road."
4594,1,"Still, the racing sequences carried the day for me, and sitting through the other real-life simulation that made up the rest of the film was my cross to bear."
4595,1,"You have to watch closely, but you can see that there are real life racers out on the track, not just an assembly of digital bits and bytes."
4596,0,"What Gran Turismo proves is that the worst thing Blomkamp can do isn’t continue to make idea-driven, divisive films, but make movies that feel like they could have been directed by anybody."
4597,1,'Gran Turismo: Based on a True Story' is a winner.
4598,0,"A normal and current film, curious and a tad boring at the same time,  [Full review in Spanish]"
4599,1,"Gran Turismo is more than a racing movie; it is an inspiring story full of valuable lessons. In addition, it shows us that the duo between cinema and video games has a lot to offer us [Full Review in Spanish]"
4600,1,"On the whole, Gran Turismo is an inspirational, delightful and intriguing affair, which should be witnessed on the big screen."
4601,1,"The first act plays like a very well executed, and treacly, cliché, albeit with a superbly edited racing sequence.  That superb editing remains as the predictable tropes of this fairy tale story fall away, and the real drama begins."
4602,1,"There is so much corporate synergy here that it’s a minor miracle the film is involving at all. Then again, director Neill Blomkamp makes the shrewd choice to abandon its gaming meta-commentary and make a reliable underdog sports film instead."
4603,1,"You'll likely end the film feeling completely pumped, wondering what impossibility you can accomplish."
4604,1,"Even if we’re familiar with the shape of the track, it’s still an honestly entertaining sports movie."
4605,1,"Credit the visuals and pacing to Blomkamp’s savvy, cinematographer Jacques Jouffret’s keen eye, editors Austyn Daines and Colby Parker Jr.’s precision cuts and dazzling driving stunts by the real Jann himself."
4606,1,Gran Turismo captures a truly remarkable young man and his journey to professional legitimacy. This is for anyone needing a jolt to the system and focusing on getting back on one’s true path in life.
4607,0,"All of the racing is either over much too quickly, showcases no sense of drama or pace, or is completely devoid of anything approaching viscerally kinetic energy."
4608,1,"With a story that can’t be denied its heart and valor, plus imaginative action-packed thrills on the race track and, more importantly, a true sense of cinematic spectacle, Gran Turismo is a solid good time."
4609,1,Gran Turismo is adrenaline and wonder at its best. It reconfigures the biopic and video game adaptation formulas to deliver an unforgettable experience. [Full review in Spanish]
4610,1,Fans of movies about the little guy who comes out on top will want to pop the champagne for this perfectly formulated underdog narrative.
4611,1,"Gran Turismo is satisfyingly simple, its ensemble an embodiment of well-worn tropes: the underdog, the jaded coach, the parents who struggle to accept their wunderkind son’s dreams."
4612,0,"Gran Turismo is definitely fun; unfortunately, that’s only when it really is about the racing. The rest of the time, it comes to a screeching halt."
4613,1,A high-speed sports epic that knows precisely when to accelerate and slow down its pace. It's fun and energetic and will keep you on the edge of the passenger seat for an endlessly-thrilling ride.
4614,1,"Blomkamp doesn’t reinvent the wheel with “Gran Turismo,” but proves he can still engage and leave us wondering what the next lap will bring."
4615,1,"This Neill Blomkamp best film since 2009 District 9. It follows tropes that we've seen before, but the performances from Archie Madekwe, David Harbour and Djimon Hounsou truly evaluate and compliment this remarkable true story."
4616,1,"Gran Turismo is an exceptionally engineered sports biography, even if the IRL is a “glazed” storyline."
4617,1,"Despite taking some liberties with the story, and inescapably treading trekking familiar territory at the best of times, Blomkamp still gives us one of the best brand-to-blockbuster transfers to date. Gran Turismo is one of the best films of the year"
4618,1,"It's a surprisingly touching story, highly entertaining, and very inspirational. Go ahead and get in the passenger seat for this one and enjoy the ride."
4619,1,Gran Turismo is the same underdog sports movie you've seen a hundred times already. It's an adequate crowd pleaser for the right audience.
4620,1,"A classic, feel good underdog story.  It may follow the formula, but it does so to great effect."
4621,1,"despite tunnel visioned focus which relegates most support to the sidelines, succeeds with its unlikely true story, exciting racing scenes and a truly noteworthy performance from David Harbour."
4622,1,"Whether you are a racing fan or not, Gran Turismo is a exhilarating peek into an unfamiliar world initiating fans of Mardenborough and the world of racing together under one roof for the experience of a lifetime."
4623,1,"Too much racing for non race fans but when it was great, it was sizzling. David Harbour steals the show as the I-can't-believe-we're-doing-this instructor and I loved Archie Madekwe as the main videogame-turned-real racer Jann. If you can dream it, be it!"
4624,1,"“Gran Turismo” may follow the beats of many sports films that have come before it, but it does so with style and energy, making it a late summer entry that should speed to success."
4625,0,"Finally, an Underdog Sports Movie where the doggedly determined heroes include a couple of huge international commercial brands. Forget about Rocky and the Karate Kid, we have PlayStation and Nissan in our corner!"
4626,1,"Slowed down by a cliché-ridden opening act, 'Gran Turismo' is an ultimately rewarding experience once the rubber hits the road in the tension-filled second half, thanks to an infectiously inspiring premise and a fantastic performance by David Harbour."
4627,0,"... shifts into high gear during its adrenaline-fueled racing sequences. But off the track, the narrative engine is idling."
4628,1,"In Neill Blomkamp's (District 9) hands Gran Turismo is slick, well-paced, and visually engaging."
4629,0,"With “Turismo,” we are merely spectators, much like the video game players who drove that game to success. It’s a shame Blomkamp couldn’t get out of his own way to drive this one into the winner’s circle.  Instead, it’s an unfortunate also-ran."
4630,1,“Gran Turismo” is a garden variety underdog story turbocharged by some electric racing scenes.
4631,0,"Solidly assembled but less stirring than it should be -- in part because it takes too many laps -- the film moves, ironically, too slow to deliver as a big-screen attraction but might fare better with its eventual pitstops on at-home platforms."
4632,1,"A serviceable underdog story with sprinkles of likeability, training montages, and things that go zoom. David Harbour carries this one through the finish line."
4633,0,"Beautifully shot with a decent underdog story, this film often loses itself in the nuance and minutia of the sport."
4634,1,"Gran Turismo is a sleek, enjoyable trek through the world of racing."
4635,0,"As entertaining as the movie is, it feels like a custom wrap on a sports car: merely an ad stuck onto Mardenborough’s unique journey to the track."
4636,1,Blomkamp (District 9) presents the racing action with an engaging fantasy/reality mix of burning rubber and game graphics that seems fitting.
4637,0,"No matter how quickly director Neill Blomkamp edits the scenes, there is a redundancy from shots of the feet, faces and hands of the drivers."
4638,0,"Gran Turismo ultimately can’t podium, never surpassing its essential origins as a live-action video game trailer, without all of the things that made Blomkamp’s work in the sphere interesting."
4639,0,"Unfortunately, copious amounts of synthetic, storyline-breaking moments make Gran Turismo feel less like an organic, cinematic experience and more like a big-budget recruitment video and E3 showcase."
4640,1,"Until something better comes along, this movie hits the finish line at full throttle."
4641,0,"Gran Turismo does far better than you'd think from the doubly-cursed genres of video games and racing — though is it really an accomplishment if your car overheats, instead of bursting into flames?"
4642,1,Thanks to deft direction and an easily compelling story ... Gran Turismo is watchable and decently enjoyable.
4643,1,"Mardenborough's story is remarkable, and it is extremely well told here. Even viewers who don't like video games will want to break out the champagne for ""Gran Turismo."" The film is a winner."
4644,0,A decent underdog story bogged down by cliches and product placement.
4645,1,Gran Turismo ticks all the boxes ... but nearly everything is about 10 percent better than it needs to be.
4646,0,Whatever dramatic potential the movie has — mostly courtesy of its performances — ends up being stamped out by filmmaking instincts best described as anti-cinematic. Racing has rarely looked this boring.
4647,1,"Gran Turismo doesn’t include many surprises, but it manages to be surprisingly engrossing. The racing scenes include plenty of thrill, and Jann is a likable kid. You’re excited to see him succeed."
4648,1,"A pastiche of sports-movie cliches, but the revved-up racing scenes will keep you hooked."
4649,1,"What ""Gran Turismo"" lacks in elegance or credibility it makes up for in style and excitement."
4650,0,"The film’s visual look is as inert as its screenplay, and its attempts to make the real racing scenes look like “Gran Turismo” gameplay by overlaying the game’s graphics with live footage fall embarrassingly flat."
4651,1,It swerves towards the populist route and races ahead with an inspiring true story that pulls at heartstrings and ignites the dreamer within.
4652,1,...the outcome is predictable. Director Neill Blomkamp recreates exciting racing scenes but they become rather repetitive. The saving grace is the bond created by Archie Madekwe and David Harbour that gets this vehicle over the finish line.
4653,1,"The lanky Madekwe is an appealing hero, one might say an avatar for us in the audience. And director Neil Blomkamp does a terrific job of making Jann’s time at the console seem “real” and the real racetrack align with the sim."
4654,1,"Flawed but impressive in size and sound, it is, when all is said and done, a pretty good time at the movies."
4655,0,"If you experience Gran Turismo at face value, you’ll get a late summer release by a disgraced filmmaker looking to produce safe, roadworthy material. However, the ""based on a true story” advertising reveals a serious falsehood in need of fine tuning."
4656,0,"Blomkamp of District 9 and Elysium is an auteur. But his adventurous spirit comes up against the hackneyed story, which is a corporate endorsement of a game evidently so hyper-realistic, it will make elite racers of its dedicated consumers."
4657,1,"I thought Archie Madekwe was great in this, because it's sort of a it's a tough role... He [makes it] feel fresh, and he's very, very likable."
4658,1,"It's a standard sports movie, but I think David Harbour brings a lot to the table. I think his character really makes this work."
4659,1,"There’s no getting around the fact that the sole reason Gran Turismo exists is to try to convince viewers how cool the game is, but as a sports movie, it follows the formula to a tee for maximum satisfaction."
4660,0,"There isn't room for subtlety or too many nuances, but the film, ahem, never stops accelerating... [Full review in Spanish]"
4661,0,The saintly devotion to the brand all but brings Gran Turismo to a screeching halt.
4662,1,...  The film is at least one argument against parents who yell at their children that all that time spent playing video games won't lead to anything in the real world.
4663,1,"Cast sells this amazing true story very well. Race car sequences are ""Top Gun"" style and really exciting."
4664,0,It doesn’t even aim for the vindication fantasies of past gamer turned savior movies like The Last Starfighter or Pixels.
4665,0,"We’re told that the PlayStation version of Gran Turismo is actually an auto racing simulation, not a game. Which is fair, because much of “Gran Turismo” feels like a simulation of an actual sports movie."
4666,1,"Gran Turismo is a story of overcoming, not about over-action. [Full review in Spanish]"
4667,1,"The sort of high-octane, feel-good movie that’s perfect to watch with your dad."
4668,0,"It's competent and anonymous, like a presentation that Moore would show to a boardroom full of his bosses."
4669,0,Payne stretches the film for well over two hours and never quite realizes the possibilities of his central conceit.
4670,0,Medium-sized disappointment...
4671,1,"Downsizing sticks in one's memory less because of the depth of its analysis than its slightly muddled, chaotic, well-meaning, bemused, troubled concern for humanity and its future."
4672,1,For all its ingenuity gets bogged down in its second half.
4673,0,Chau's performance is the film's highlight.
4674,0,"[Downsizing]doesn't quite compensate for the placidity and silliness of Paul's core existential crises, or his flirtation with deterministic serendipity"
4675,0,"By the standards of an experienced writer/director no less, Downsizing is an aggravating, half-baked idea with no teeth in its mouth and no end in sight."
4676,0,"Every choice leads down the most boring, self-indulgent path, and the destination is this empty void of a movie."
4677,0,The story and its metaphorical messages about life aren't difficult to decipher. It's that I didn't care enough about most of the characters to want to embrace anything they were trying to say.
4678,0,This movie ruined me.
4679,0,I physically hated this movie.
4680,0,Downsizing fails because it is neither fish nor fowl. It can't commit as a science-fiction film and it never becomes the biting social satire the first act seems to intimate.
4681,0,"Too bad Hong Chau's character showed up so late in the film, she could have possibly saved it..."
4682,0,"By far director Alexander Payne's worst film to date, it has plots for about five movies, all undercooked."
4683,0,"Despite its clever premise, certain cliché plot elements make Downsizing predictable and ironically, unoriginal."
4684,1,"Thoughtful, imaginative and deeply compassionate."
4685,0,"Alexander Payne may have started this project with big ambitions, but, unfortunately this film caused us to downsize our expectations."
4686,1,"Downsizing gets increasingly more devastating as it inches through its 135-minute duration, but reminds you that being human and compassionate has nothing to do with how big you are."
4687,1,"It is comforting that at this point, there is someone with enough faith in the human race to sign a feel-good movie as frank, naive and optimistic as this one. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4688,1,"Hong Chau's performance is superb, and she roots the movie in emotions that heretofore had largely been missing."
4689,0,A rare miss for Alexander Payne.
4690,0,"Just does not work, losing itself among political ambitions that are both painfully on the nose and woefully undercooked."
4691,0,"With our protagonist's motivations unclear, so too is the point of the film."
4692,1,"Honey, they shrunk Matt Damon in a hilariously surreal sci-fi comedy -- although they should have downsized the second half ."
4693,0,"Alexander Payne's Downsizing is visually stunning, but it doesn't live up to all of its pretentious ambitions. [Full review in Spanish]"
4694,0,Downsizing is mostly a disappointment because it feels like a waste of a brilliant idea.
4695,1,"Payne's script has a tendency to meander (making room for plenty of cameos), and Downsizing is overlong, but the world it creates is so simultaneously fascinating and horrifying that you don't mind spending some more time there."
4696,0,Downsizing is fuddled and over crowded with little to no conflict to take the story forward. It's a beautiful looking film - with plush green vistas and sleek picturisation - that completely lacks substance.
4697,1,"The first half of the movie is quite good, engaging and funny in a thoughtful way. Unfortunately, the plot gets weighed down by unnecessary additions that cause it to feel a bit heavy-handed."
4698,0,"Oscillating considerably in tone and mood, Downsizing abruptly jumps from a poignant drama to a bleached pseudo-thriller, and then to a bland comedy."
4699,0,"Downsizing was simply just not a good movie, in my opinion. I wanted it to be good mainly because the concept seemed really original."
4700,1,Downsizing dares to ask if humans will be ready to make the sacrifices necessary for the survival and preservation of the species is on the line.
4701,0,"What a disappointment Downsizingturns out to be, a nearly complete waste of an incredibly original concept from director Alexander Payne."
4702,0,"Initially it has a magnetic pull, its premise familiar yet scarily out there. But then come a whole new batch of questions and answers, spinning in different directions, and the film can't maintain that initial excitement, wonder, and indeed cruelty."
4703,0,"Fails to capitalize on the ""man shrinks"" concept in any meaningful way, shape, or size."
4704,0,It's a real dud and (pardon the pun) a BIG letdown of a movie.
4705,0,"So far so good; still synapses-igniting and discussion-worthy. Had craft been chosen over concept, Downsizing would have remained so and avoided a spectacular self-immolation."
4706,0,"Once it's proven the plot is going to its logically generic conclusion, I realized the fun had stopped."
4707,1,"Alexander Payne makes deadpan comedy...I loved this movie, and it evolves in ways I could have never predicted."
4708,0,"What starts out as an intriguing idea swerves into an unexpected, unwelcome and irreparably clunky territory."
4709,1,"Downsizing transcends its own gimmick, even if we chuckle we realize that the way things are going, it's not that bad of an idea."
4710,1,"The global community writ small is kind of fascinating, a microcosm of all the world's excesses and impoverishment in one package."
4711,0,All those disparate elements fail to gel.
4712,0,"Downsizing starts at a fantastic pace, it looks good and the concept is intriguing but ultimately it loses its way."
4713,0,"For a film that markets itself as a man's journey to self-discovery, the film needs a journey to find itself."
4714,0,"I was wooed to this film by the promise of tiny people and their miniature accessories, and I paid a price of over two hours of wasted casting potential, wasted concept potential and mostly wasted time."
4715,0,Downsizing is both ambitious and fundamentally problematic. Caricature of minority characters and low emotional stakes keep it from being a powerful apocalyptic allegory.
4716,0,"Once Paul and Tran get together, the movie becomes something else entirely: Boring, predictable, and...small."
4717,0,"Overall, Downsizing feigns at many themes and embraces none, a sampler platter of personal growth, consumerism, climate change, fresh starts, and apocalypse survival."
4718,1,"It's a smart idea, and Payne uses the first third of his film to investigate it from many different angles-psychologically, environmentally, even scientifically."
4719,1,We have a movie that establishes its premise impressively well before ultimately losing its intrigue and sheen as things play out.
4720,0,"Just when Downsizing seems to be cruising on a steady track, it starts fracturing, fragmenting, and spinning out in multiple, largely unexpected, and almost wholly unsatisfying directions."
4721,0,"It's a preachy, dishonest film that practices a continual narrative sleight of hand to keep you from zeroing in on its mushy allegorical meaning."
4722,1,"Downsizing finds Payne taking a more ambitious direction, as if having something of a crossroads moment himself...Courageous, certainly. Intriguing, ditto. Successful? Not entirely."
4723,0,There's a weird love story between them [Paul and Ngoc Lan Tran] inserts itself into an already boring plot. But even that is not as alarming as the hyperbole thrust in our faces.
4724,1,A touching piece of high-concept science fiction with a twisted sense of humor.
4725,1,"...an exquisite cast, probably one of the most intelligent comeidies of the year. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4726,1,"Sometimes a change of perspective helps a person to better understand the world, and Downsizing makes it literal. [Full review in Spanish]"
4727,0,Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau feature in a fine cast but the entire plot meanders too much in search of decent narrative hinge. The middle act is in particular need of a boot up the rear.
4728,0,The really sobering economy of scale about this overlong auteur indulgence is that it cost $68 million to make and none of that money went on a script doctor.
4729,1,The most ambitious and least convincing film of Nebraska's talented filmmaker [Alexander Payne]. [Full Review in Spanish]
4730,0,"The intentions were good, but nothing worth remembering. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4731,1,"But the movie which starts with incredible promise and is utterly engrossing then morphs inexplicably into a completely different film halfway through. And so here we are, disappointed and bewildered, reading a three-star review."
4732,1,There are good things in this small package but the two genres never quite fit together.
4733,1,An ingenious and original premise. [Full Review in Spanish]
4734,1,"While Downsizing is not not about the end of human life on earth, it confronts the prospect with minimal sentiment, and uses it to ask questions about what the good life might consist of, here and now."
4735,1,"With his latest film, Alexander Payne finds himself teetering uncomfortably atop a high-concept device and wrestling with tonal clashes."
4736,0,"It's not mankind that's been shrunk, it's Payne's conception."
4737,0,"There are some funny lines here, but the story rambles inordinately."
4738,0,"... with a premise this ingenious, one wishes Downsizing as a whole was too."
4739,1,You admire the ambitious storytelling and the craftsmanship of its execution.
4740,0,It simply does not work.
4741,0,"For all the high concept wonders at work, Payne can't seem to break out of his own rut."
4742,0,"Because instead of continuing with the wonderfully ridiculous notion of observing a 13cm man try and win back his 165cm wife, Payne decides to deliver a thunderously dull and miserable sermon on the human condition."
4743,0,The clever concept morphs into an ineffective and heavy-handed satire in which Matt Damon's character and a Vietnamese immigrant go on an adventure that rivals the excitement one would feel watching itty bitty blades of grass grow.
4744,0,"It offers a jumble of barely explored, quarter-baked ideas attached to a laborious plot."
4745,1,"It starts out quick, sharp and funny and ends as a solemn and slow-moving leviathan: a movie overwhelmed by its own ecological and human implications ..."
4746,1,A disappointing film made watchable thanks to solid performances and some constantly polite chuckles.
4747,0,"The idea is wonderful, but it feels as though Payne doesn't quite know what to do with it once his characters are in place."
4748,1,"Despite the bloated running time and the sometimes unnerving tonal jumps, Downsizing is an ambitious, frequently funny, intricately detailed movie that is, for the most part, entertaining and thought provoking."
4749,0,"Dare we say that this once admired indie writer-director, who made Exhibition, Sideways and About Schmidt, is developing a humourless streak?"
4750,1,"It's a state-of-the-nation address by stealth, wry and wide-reaching."
4751,1,"A smart, thought-provoking miniature piece."
4752,0,"I usually love Payne, but his bloated Downsizing (all 135 minutes of it) needs trimming all around."
4753,1,"Payne's lm is full of invention, wit, great scenes and big - if not fully realised - intentions. Downsizing may be about a small world, but it is an audacious, out-sized peach of a picture."
4754,1,No small achievement. Alexander Payne re-confirms his position as one of US cinema's premier filmmakers.
4755,0,A thoroughly bizarre misfire...
4756,1,"The film, fortunately, ends up finding its center. [Full Review in Spanish]"
4757,0,[Downsizing is director Alexander] Payne's ultimate revenge on American film tradition. His inability to imagine an original story - to move an audience's basic aspirations without guilt - is another sign of decadence.
4758,0,A spectacular premise that loses shape. [Full review in Spanish]
4759,1,An acute piece of social satire. [Full review in Spanish]
4760,0,"Oddly for a film about the ecological benefits of keeping things small, Downsizing suffers from a curious case of bloat."
4761,0,"Matt Damon spends far too much of this film in awe, and rather than make you think, it is simply boring."
4762,0,"The movie is a scattershot collection of large-scale ideas framed by the irony of its premise, but never reaches its potential for satire or commentary."
4763,1,"Working from an audacious idea conceived by his long-time collaborator Jim Taylor, co-scenarist and director Alexander Payne (Nebraska) has pulled off one of the great cinematic accomplishments of the new millennium."
4764,1,"While it dithers in what it wants to eventually say, it is certainly a fun watch."
4765,0,Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor don't tack enough inches on to what could have been a nifty idea for our greed-filled times.
4766,1,"Right now, Downsizing is ahead of its time, understandably rejected by audiences (and in an unbelievable betrayal, also by the critics). They should pick on someone their own size."
4767,1,A science fiction fable that is actually less naive than it seems. [Full review in Spanish]
4768,0,Everything is a little on the nose and the burgeoning relationship between Paul and Tran is not interesting enough to sustain the social commentary. That is made worse when the story moves into an apocalyptic tangent in the third act.
4769,1,A mean-spirited film with nothing to redeem.
4770,1,"It’s brimming with both warmth and cynicism, cementing a Santa perfectly attuned to the times and emblematic of the joy and anguish that pervades this time of year... a new Christmas classic."
4771,1,"Violent Night is one of the biggest surprises of the year, instantly becoming a contemporary Christmas classic! David Harbour expertly embodies a shockingly brutal, savage version of Santa Claus that somehow still delivers lovely messages."
4772,1,"Violent Night is an instant CHRISTMAS CLASSIC. A bloody, gnarly, & goofy time that brings the laughs, the action, & Especially the Christmas magic! David Harbour is the definitive most realistic Santa Claus you could put into a movie"
4773,1,"No sane person will consider Violent Night a perennial classic, but Harbour inspires enough ho-ho-hos and cheeky holiday mayhem to warrant a watch."
4774,1,"If there’s one thing about Harbour that has always sung, it’s the charisma he can generate with just about material and any actor on screen. He’s also a very big man, standing tall and making a dad bod seem more desirable than Zac Efron ever could."
4775,0,"If I want a bad Santa, I’ll watch Bad Santa. That’s not to say there isn’t some measure of worthy seasonal jeer in Violent Night."
4776,1,"It’s not a holiday classic like Die Hard, but it is a decent temporary remedy for the mandatory holiday cheer."
4777,1,"""Violent Night"" is as-advertised. It’s more vicious than one might expect from this action comedy, but it starts at a high-level of foulness when Santa upchucks on someone and just continues on from there."
4778,0,Fun take on Santa Claus but we have to hold Harbour up to Billy Bob standards.
4779,0,"Excessively violent, laced with a thick vein of jet-black humor, bolstered by a formidable turn from Harbour, and packed to the rafters with hard-hitting scraps, Violent Night knows exactly what it wants to be, but doesn’t really try to be anything else."
4780,1,David Harbour owns the screen as the at-first grumpy but still very caring and ultimately badass Mr. Claus.
4781,1,"“Die Hard,” and Michael Dougherty’s “Krampus,” meets “Bad Santa,” with full shot of Christmas adrenaline."
4782,1,"An excellent Harbour leads the cast, and a terrific Legui-zamo makes for a perfect antagonist."
4783,1,"It’s heartwarming violence, a very merry massacre, and holly jolly hammer time but it also put me in the Christmas spirit."
4784,1,Many movies have attempted to replicate the festive insouciant brutality of <i>Die Hard</i>. No movie has come closer to this lofty goal than this dementedly delicious nightmare before Christmas.
4785,0,Bad Santa as John McClane may believe it is being a kind of subversive anti-Christmas movie alternative but its best moments involve not violence but our hero rediscovering the joy that the season once provided as its own relief from the world's evils.
4786,1,"It's a Santa flick where old Saint Nick is a rough and tumble action hero. Imagine Die Hard meets John Wick meets Home Alone. It's a lot of fun and quite over the top and bloody, but in a strange way, a little endearing at times, too."
4787,1,"Violent Night is an unforgettable new Christmas action classic, perfect for those who want to hate on Die Hard being a holiday classic—now you have one that is undeniable."
4788,0,"With Violent Night, we were promised a deranged, Santa-meets-Die–Hard flick shorn of holiday schmaltz. Instead, the action-comedy just another soppy movie about the Christmas spirit."
4789,1,"But you can’t miss Violent Night. An action vehicle that doesn’t hold back for a bit, this is the movie that nobody knew they wanted but is now the movie we need."
4790,1,"The illegitimate love child of Bad Santa and Die Hard, which compels a hungover and disillusioned Saint Nick to dole out season's beatings when he should be delivering presents to sweetly slumbering children."
4791,1,Santa has something clever and violent for grownups.
4792,1,"If David Harbour doesn’t commit to the bit so hard in this he delivers a genuinely great performance, it’s just a lark. He’s just way too good of an actor to keep this from floating away."
4793,1,a manic but enjoyable Christmas snack.
4794,1,...a decidedly larger-than-life premise that’s employed to erratic yet entertaining effect...
4795,1,This action-packed effort is as irreverent as it is endearing.
4796,1,"The result is no Christmas classic, but it's a jolly good time that should appeal to the inner child (and jejune sense of humor) in us all."
4797,1,"Violent Night isn’t just a horror movie. This is a really inventive, super fun sleigh ride with better-than-average dialogue, and energetic fight scenes with a man dressed in several layers of fur and leather."
4798,1,"Amidst all the scenery chewing, there's nobody having as good a time as Harbour. His Santa is John McClane by way of <i>The Northman</i>, but it's the little things he brings to the part  that really stand out."
4799,1,"The finale of Violent Night is so good, I bet most people won’t care about the choppy storytelling before that, because the climactic action is just so fun and over the top."
4800,1,"Very self-aware, Violent Night knows just what tropes to poke and when to lean into sincerity. The film shares a similar tone with Deadpool 2; while it goes for gut laughs, you don’t leave with a caustic feeling."
4801,1,"The script needs some work and there are too many characters, but Wirkola’s film has great fun turning Christmas on its head."
4802,0,One of those bad movies that keeps piling on things that make it worse and worse as it goes on.
4803,1,"A solid-enough mainstream stab at Christmas comedy-horror—albeit not nearly as clever as 2016’s undervalued Better Watch Out, another twisty home invasion tale."
4804,1,"The tone fluctuates wildly from scene to scene, from sweet holiday comedy to acerbic social satire to intense action shoot-em-up. But it all works."
4805,1,Violent Night overcomes its weak script and familiar concept with enough ooey gooey squelchy violence to appease bloodthirsty horror fans and action junkies alike. It still manages to be a bloody festive blast filled with head squashing Christmas carnage.
4806,1,"Director Tommy Wirkola stages the mayhem creatively, with acrobatic moves and maximum bloodshed, and with a gleeful abandon that confirms the movie is on the comedy side of the action-comedy divide."
4807,1,"Die Hard in a Manjer. One of the big film surprises of the year, you won't have to be drunk on spiked eggnog to enjoy Violent Night."
4808,0,"It’s like attending a party where no two guests are on sufficiently good terms to manage even 20 minutes of civilised conversation. “Perfect for Christmas Day then,” I hear you say. Too cynical."
4809,1,"It was never boring, [and] I think you'll dig it, especially if you like action movies with some comedy."
4810,1,"What audiences will get in their stocking is a bit of naughty and nice, with a narrative structure that throws back to 90’s action, and a delightful performance from David Harbour as jolly ole’ Saint Nick."
4811,0,"I could not help but visit the theater for this Christmas movie, which features what ought to be a fun, irreverent concept, like 'Bad Santa' (2003). Unfortunately, the mix of comedy, sentimentality and violence doesn't work very well this time around."
4812,0,"112 minutes of your life rather than a day, which is a small gift..."
4813,0,"For all its devil-may-care mishmash of tropes and bludgeoning mayhem, Wirkola’s jape is not quite up to scratch as a future Christmas-nasty classic."
4814,1,"A riotously fun spectacle starring a lovable, murderous, man bun-sporting Santa Claus trapped in a mediocre story."
4815,1,"Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house Santa and his sledgehammer waited to pounce. It’s funny, crude, action-packed, and worth the price of admission thanks to David Harbour's low-key Santa and John Leguizamo's over-the-top Scrooge."
4816,1,"David Harbour is everything here as Santa, and carries the film as effortlessly as the sack on his back."
4817,0,"There is a brilliant sequence that re-imagines what would have really happened to the bad guys in ""Home Alone"" had the traps been real, but the rest is just pointless violent and unlikable characters from Santa to Scrooge"
4818,1,"It has a ton of heart, even when that heart is being pounded into mincemeat by a sledgehammer."
4819,1,This is the best idea for a movie that anyone has EVER had for a movie.
4820,1,This is an absurdly entertaining holiday movie with the attitude of an action romp.
4821,1,Violent Night offers up a timely amalgam: It is torture porn that is also a morality play.
4822,1,"Violent Night is an entertaining dumb movie, and if you like the kind of R-rated film you can laugh at, put this one on your December movie list"
4823,1,Violent Night is the definitive anti-Hallmark Christmas movie.
4824,1,"Terribly violent, if you have a weak stomach, this may not be the film you want to see."
4825,1,This film perfectly blends the gore and violence yet still gives you that warm fuzzy feeling a holiday film does. A must-see! David Harbour was made for this role.
4826,1,"David Harbour makes a particularly good cranky, butt-kicking Santa, in a movie that offers the sort of shared experience that should bring theaters some much-needed cheer."
4827,0,"But it has its moments (the Home Alone tribute is particularly inspired), and I certainly don’t begrudge anyone who finds some joy in this work. You should feel free to talk to me again once your tastes improve."
4828,1,"David Harbour makes for a great, butt-kicking Santa. First half a little slow, but it definitely builds up to bloody glory."
4829,0,"Big on gore, but not much more."
4830,1,"Violent Night is not great cinema, but it does exactly what it sets out to do: Entertain and delight holiday crowds who would rather flinch and whoop as Santa breaks bones than cheer big holiday musical numbers."
4831,1,Violent Night gives an interesting spin to the cheesy Christmas movies.
4832,0,"The Santa action, which does not truly kick off until a good length into the film, feels a little lagging and soft compared to the ultra-kinetic brawling we’ve come to expect from these kinds of films."
4833,1,"Violent Night feels like someone got frustrated at everyone saying Die Hard isn’t a Christmas movie and they responded with, “Hold my nog.”"
4834,1,"Violent Night ultimately executes its thematic templates exactly as we’d expect, despite its singular blend of sensibilities."
4835,1,"... While combining the character archetypes of Die Hard with the bloody slapstick of Home Alone, it’s in absurdity that this film thrives."
4836,1,"Good holiday movies are few and far between and while Violent Night isn’t top shelf, it’s a holiday actioner that gives its lumps with glee."
4837,1,A fun and bloody Christmas infamy with the real Santa as an accidental hero. [Full review in Spanish]
4838,1,"""Behind all the gore-splattered walls and domestic rancor lies a sweet-and-sour bedtime story of good triumphing over evil."""
4839,1,"Overall, Violent Night is knockabout fun, but if only the script wasn’t so pleased with itself."
4840,0,"The movie mostly seems interested in pushing its R rating, and it loses itself in that relentless pursuit. It’ll be a blast for some. But for those who burn out on its gimmick, I can see it being an endurance test."
4841,1,There is enough anti-holiday magic and grim cheer that it contends for the coveted spot of ... repeat offender for many Decembers to come.
4842,0,"The fight scenes are competent; the gore and gunfire are plentiful, there are some reasonably clever kills, and the occasional kidding of action movie clichés are welcome."
4843,1,"Full of blood, gore, and strong language, this is no kids' movie, but Harbour's lovable performance and a gleeful irreverence around the familiar action scenes make this a fun holiday gift."
4844,1,"Violent Night does exactly what it sets out to do, and does so with panache, frivolity, and style."
4845,1,"If a drunken Santa Clause tearing through bad guys on his naughty list sounds like a good time to you, Silent Night won't disappoint! Violent Night is a very silly, stupid movie. I happen to like silly and stupid movies."
4846,1,"If the sound of Santa swinging his sledge hammer like Thor while yelling ""Naughty Naughty"" doesn’t jingle your bells, this aint for you."
4847,1,"Despite all the gore and violence and other R-rated material, it’s arguably less offensive than the kind of bilge proliferated by Netflix and Lifetime/Hallmark/etc. in the name of Holiday Cheer."
4848,1,Harbour’s jaded charisma is the film’s secret weapon (that and a massive hammer).
4849,1,"As far as over-the-top holiday movies go, this could definitely become an annual tradition in some households."
4850,0,"Knows how to make its familiar parts gleam when it wants to, but that isn't often enough."
4851,1,Amalgamates its spiritual ancestors for a rollicking action-comedy with its tongue—as well as a candy cane—lodged firmly in its rosy cheek.
4852,0,"Wirkola never quite resolves whether he’s riffing on Christmas movies or delivering something genuine, and the uneven result doesn’t work."
4853,1,"Violent Night is a great movie to watch with an audience. Despite all the violence, there's an honest Christmas spirit here."
4854,1,"Violent Night manages to deliver the heart of a traditional Christmas classic in between the blood-spraying and bone-breaking violence. The action is fun, the humor is sharp, and David Harbour embodies everything you want in an ass-kicking Santa Claus."
4855,1,"Violent Night is as insane as a Santa Claus meets John Wick premise should be. David Harbour kicks all kinds of ass, and the fights are even more brutal than expected. There are unnecessary story points along the way, but the final result is a good time."
4856,1,"Despite refusing to tip a few scales in the favor of those attempting to rob the rich to feed themselves, Violent Night still manages to conjure its own holiday miracle—the desire for a sequel in a market glutted with them."
4857,1,David Harbour is perfectly cast...
4858,1,"Violent Night isn’t the first film to deliver an R-rated Santa Claus story, but it’s one of the best if you find the idea of jolly old St. Nick engaging in a bit of the old ultraviolence appealing."
4859,0,"The sort of wannabe cult action-comedy that gets off on its own displays of horrible behavior and listless set pieces, this Santa-goes-berserk story wants to be a new alt-holiday classic."
4860,1,The movie is a bloody good time enjoyed most in a collective space. David Harbour is a killing machine as the very endearing and not-so-jolly Kris Kringle. It’s a must-watch for a silly and gory escape.
4861,1,"It’s a fun and brutal holiday romp with a great performance by David Harbour, but it doesn’t quite reach the level of peak action it promises."
4862,0,"Intended as a satire, it is gory and unpleasant, mean-spirited in the extreme, and entirely without purpose. The most extraordinary thing about it is that it ever got made at all."
4863,1,Violent Night is a jolly good time wrapped in glorious barbarity.
4864,1,"Ingenious at times, Violent Night is rowdy yet innocuous, playful yet inconsequential, savage yet pleasant, and unapologetic, sheer fun..."
4865,1,If Violent Night had one goal — to be a Christmas movie for adults pumping with bloodlust after surviving the shopping mall parking lot — then it succeeded.
4866,1,I'll be honest with you: I enjoyed this movie. I'm totally down for a prequel and/or a sequel. I want to see more from this world I want to see more of the David Harbor Santa Claus.
4867,1,A surprisingly large success in my book.
4868,1,"A dark yuletide comedy with a twist -- and a gouge, and more than a few crushed skulls -- Violent Night is clearly hoping you’ll be having too much fun to say “ho-ho-hold on a minute” to some of its faults."
4869,0,"Rodriguez's spirit and good intentions seem to have been lost among medium budgets —but perhaps not quite generous enough— excessive seriousness, and convoluted plots in a sort of $65 million B-movie with Nolan-esque aspirations."
4870,0,"A laughably bad, poorly acted movie. When nothing is real or as it seems, and you can’t trust anything you see happening, who cares? I certainly didn’t."
4871,0,Hypnotic is essentially a B-grade product disguised as a smart movie. [Full review in Spanish]
4872,0,Essentially “Lobster Stuffed with Tacos: The Movie.”
4873,0,"A narratively inert film that, despite having good performances, an appropriately intense soundtrack, and intriguing ideas, simply doesn't know what it wants. The only thing that “Hypnotic” manages to do is CONFUSE the viewer. Full review in Spanish."
4874,0,[Rodriguez] quickly reaches a dead end that leads him to have to explain each next step of the action with too many words. [Full review in Spanish]
4875,1,"Hypnotic is another Robert Rodríguez movie with its feet firmly planted on the ground when it's time to shoot, but with its head in the stratosphere when conceiving the script, scenes, and dialogues. [Full review in Spanish]"
4876,0,"Rodríguez accumulates multiple situations, each one more absurd than the one before, which he intertwines with some action scenes resolved with much more skill than that applied to addressing poor Affleck's exploits. [Full review in Spanish]"
4877,1,"Let those of us who accept the real unreality of a Raymond Chandler Philip K. Dick, enjoy a Ben Affleck playing a metatemporal detective... [Full review in Spanish]"
4878,0,The film articulates itself as a theory of mental power made from twists and turns that require a course final explanation. [Full review in Spanish]
4879,0,A poorly-written attempt at cerebral science fiction that collapses under the weight of its own stupidity.
4880,0,"It doesn’t even lean into its absurdity, blowing an opportunity to pitch a tent in Campville and inspire a few hoots."
4881,0,"You can only chip away at reality so far until everything in 'Hypnotic' starts to feel sketched and feckless. Any type of resolution reads as either disingenuous or completely unearned, as viewers were never invested in the journeys in the first place."
4882,0,"At one point, [Diana] tells Rourke that “pain keeps the mind awake” — and, while the excruciating script doesn’t seem to have that effect on Affleck, it’s hard not to find yourself a little enlivened by Hypnotic’s sheer absurdity."
4883,0,"""Hypnotic"" is just not a worthwhile endeavor for audiences as the actors almost seem to not believe in the material. There's a better film somewhere here, but it's not the one we've been given."
4884,1,"There were some plot holes, but I still had a fun time with it."
4885,0,To many ideas that make everything an uninteresting story...
4886,0,Un-original in parts and a confusing storyline do not make for good watching… this is one too avoid.
4887,0,"Hypnotic is as misleading as everything you see on the screen. I couldn’t help feeling bluffed in the end, sadly realizing how empty this experience was."
4888,0,The film's ambitious scope and stylised action can't make up for a far-fetched script that's full of derivative dialogue.
4889,0,This is what happens when a less-talented director tries to make a Christopher Nolan movie.
4890,0,"There’s a solid game of cat-and-mouse in there somewhere... As it inevitably switches gears into sci-fi territory, the story loses sight of that, devolving into a ludicrous conspiracy and a tiresome version of Inception’s Spinning Top."
4891,1,"This movie is messing with the characters minds and yours too, in a very entertaining way."
4892,0,There’s no balance in Hypnotic. It’s all bad. The only saving grace is that the movie bucks the modern trend of overlong run times and winds up after a blessed ninety-three minutes.
4893,0,"Rodriguez may have been going for a thrilling film that features creativity and excitement, but Hypnotic is everything but."
4894,0,Hypnotic‘s compelling vibe is slowly-but-surely diminished by a hit-and-miss midsection...
4895,1,"The film is thoroughly entertaining while it lasts, and mercifully forgettable."
4896,0,"Sadly, the title is a case of false advertising. Affleck looks far more sleepy than hypnotized by this incredibly derivative script."
4897,1,"Hypnotic is a speedy, twisty, riotously enjoyable thriller that seeks to bend your mind into impossible shapes while also delivering more than a few droll wisecracks."
4898,0,Don’t let the Christopher Nolan-like advertising fool you: Hypnotic is a decidedly average movie where effective thrills are let down by a shoddy script. Only those truly under Affleck’s spell need apply.
4899,0,"Which is another type of movie set, and maybe a better idea for a film. Ultimately as absurd but not nearly as beguiling as the Spy Kids movies, Hypnotic is a fizzle not for spoiling but for perhaps making it sound more interesting than it actually is."
4900,0,"At times I was reminded of the 2015 thriller Solace, in which Anthony Hopkins helped the FBI by functioning as a sort of psychic satnav. Somehow, this is even sillier."
4901,1,Fast-paced and thrilling...
4902,1,
4903,0,"As it is, even with the short running time, there are plenty of opportunities to notice the lack of spark between Affleck and Braga, the grating bombast of the soundtrack and the paltry special effects."
4904,0,"It’s sloppily executed, without a hint of dramatic tension."
4905,0,"The mood is gun-happy and conspiracy-minded, but the real killer is what feels like 80 percent of the running time being spent with Affleck and co-stars standing in rooms explaining the plot."
4906,0,"'Hypnotic' it isn't, nor is it any good."
4907,1,"This is an electric cocktail of Christopher Nolan mind-bending and Troublemaker Studios exploitation ridiculousness. You’ve had this concoction in better forms, but the ice cubes light up in this drink, and there is sugar on the rim."
4908,0,"A surprisingly leaden dud from the normally kinetic Robert Rodriguez, this sci-fi movie pushes its stars through reams of colorless exposition and a few chintzy-looking FX scenes."
4909,0,Certainly not the steroid-fueled Hitchcockian thriller Rodriguez was going for. You’ll forget this one before you hit the parking lot.
4910,0,"The plethora of plot twists will keep some viewers chuckling, but the overwhelming amount of exposition takes away most of the magic. Affleck is fine, but there is way too much happening here."
4911,0,"It neutralizes itself. It becomes ""why are we even setting up all these [storytelling] structures?"""
4912,1,"A thoroughly entertaining, B-grade imitation of a mediocre Christopher Nolan knockoff."
4913,0,"The muted, lo-fi production values make the film feel like a B-tier hack job, and the execution, uninspired dialogue and wooden acting don’t help."
4914,1,"A mostly-OK mash-up of Inception, Memento and other mind-bending, high-concept thrillers of yesteryear."
4915,1,"[A] chintzy lo-fi Christopher Nolan riff that doesn’t have nearly enough life to work. And yet, there are just enough charming elements to save it from outright dismissal."
4916,1,"Rodriguez is an unapologetic student and practitioner of B-movies. Within that realm, Hypnotic is actually somewhat restrained, at times borderline classical."
4917,0,"As a film fan, you have to respect the continued indie spirit with which Rodriguez works... but the script and performances in “Hypnotic” are too laughably absurd to take seriously."
4918,0,"The script feels like it was written from the point of the reveal, only to have a stagnant first seventy minutes do Hypnotic no favors."
4919,1,"Clandestine identities are peeled back, shredded and stripped. Scenes are craftily played out again and reconstructed, with their reality reshaped, and payoff dolled out in a trickery of a story. ""Hypnotic"" is a mind-twisting ride from start to finish."
4920,0,A trashy action pic with lots of twists.
4921,0,Each twist feels more like a smudging eraser to what transpires before the swerve than an enhancing accentuation to what was being built.
4922,0,"Even with Affleck working to keep the audience engaged, Rodriguez’s story crumbles under its own weight."
4923,1,"Hypnotic is a twisty science fiction thriller from the mind of indie action auteur, Robert Rodriguez. The Ben Affleck starrer is an entertaining throwback piece, the type of film that Bruce Willis or even Affleck himself might have toplined 20 years ago."
4924,0,"To make such a film in a post-Marvel, post-streaming world is a legitimately interesting feat. The ultimate result is a decently-engaging watch with enough fast-paced plot twists to shock M. Night Shyamalan."
4925,0,No amount of hypnotism can convince viewers with basic quality standards that Hypnotic is a good movie. Ben Affleck's robotic acting makes this dull and witless sci-fi mystery even worse.
4926,0,"Director Robert Rodriguez throws in some desultory gunfights and car chases, apparently in the belief that having stuff happen on screen is the same thing as telling a story or developing a plot."
4927,1,"Despite its well-made action scenes, the film doesn't have the frenetic energy that has previously set Rodríguez apart. [Full review in Spanish]"
4928,0,This slick and formulaic crime thriller begins with a mildly intriguing premise before evolving into a rather conventional cat-and-mouse battle of wits and weaponry.
4929,0,"Like Inception, but dumb."
4930,1,"While it's not plausible, believable, or even able to fully follow its own logic strains, it does achieve a certain level of deranged camp. Put it this way: It's never dull, and if nothing else, ""Hypnotic"" is a hoot."
4931,0,'Hypnotic' throws as much of its tricks at you and unfortunately fails to land the emotive DNA it hopes to make you level with.
4932,1,"A doofy, though never boring sci-fi thriller."
4933,1,"For the most part it's fast-paced and clever, capitalizing on Rodriguez's economical filmmaking style, which includes shooting and editing the film while enlisting family members in other key roles."
4934,1,"The movie is, if nothing else, ruthlessly efficient enough in delivering its crowd-pleasing bits that truly starving suspense genre hounds, at least, won’t necessarily mind."
4935,0,"A grumpy Ben Affleck can’t save this confused thriller that has as many twists as a trepanning drill, and is about as likely to leave you feeling lobotomised."
4936,0,“Hypnotic” can’t shake its televisual impulses and feature motion picture limitations.
4937,0,Dismal knockoff of Scanners and Inception.
4938,0,Affleck trudges through the proceedings... barely lifting his eyes and delivering his lines in a gritted monotone.
4939,1,"An uneven, at times mesmerizing and dazzling mind-bender of a psychological thriller that plays like a drive-in movie version of a Christopher Nolan film."
4940,0,"Rodriguez’s latest is a slick yet sleepy thriller that feels utterly disconnected from any real creative vision — ironic, given how it’s been touted as a decades-spanning passion project."
4941,1,"It’s initially odd seeing Affleck in as low-rent a project as this. Yet a likable, overqualified B-movie lead in the Dana Andrews mold, his company is the kind of thing that tips Hypnotic over into comfort viewing."
4942,0,"Hypnotic’s relentless barrage of bait-and-switches renders it opaque, concealing not only the emotional journey of Ben Affleck’s grieving father protagonist, but the logistics of the winding plot."
4943,0,"Hypnotic idles in tedium instead of moving at a brisk and engaging pace. Instead of standing distinctly in its genre, it feels like a knockoff."
4944,0,"There are a few moments when Hypnotic seems to have found its groove, but they are just an illusion."
4945,1,"Hypnotic is gloriously silly, but consistently entertaining as it plays fast and loose with its mystic premise and keeps us as an audience hooked with every wild turn over the course of its brisk 94 minutes."
4946,0,"A cool premise on paper ends up being a disappointing, hollow misfire on screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
4947,1,"Hypnotic borders on absurd, lands nearly all of its ridiculous twists and turns, and does it all with a lead actor who, even if nobody else did, understood the assignment. The sci-fi concept is actually really strong, even if...too corny."
4948,0,The gimmicky plot outwits itself with twists that will make your eyes roll.
4949,0,"It’s easy enough to follow, but annoying in that we know we’re wasting brainpower piecing this pointless jumble together."
4950,0,"Rodriguez forgoes his usual playfulness and sense of rebellious fun in favor of a Christopher Nolan-like mind-bender, bogged down by an overly serious approach and convoluted storytelling."
4951,1,"As the season gets stuffier with bigger budgets and runtimes, it will act as a cosy reminder of what a summer movie looked like 20 years ago, and what’s more hypnotic than that?"
4952,0,The real power of hypnosis is Robert Rodriguez being able to get this nonsense made
4953,0,"While the final act provides some thrills, getting there requires you to endure two acts desperately in need of a dose of adrenaline."
4954,1,"Hypnotic has that run-and-gun energy, rough around the edges but not in a way that impinges on the fun."
4955,0,"The reality is that, not unlike an Escher painting, the damn thing keeps tying itself into knots. This isn’t the mesmerizing neuro-noir you want it to be. It’s closer to Inception for Dummies."
4956,1,"Give “Hypnotic” time. It gets better. Not great, but better as it goes along."
4957,0,"Despite its overly familiar story, Hypnotic could have been an entertaining B-grade movie with an A-list star; instead, it’s a forgettable, flat experience that lost its fizz at the scripting stage."
4958,1,"“Hypnotic” is rewarding in the sense that if you give the movie an inch, you could walk away satisfied at the end. Having absurd expectations in check is certainly a prerequisite. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
4959,0,The film is a pointlessly complicated house of cards that crumbles due to its own hollowness.
4960,0,"[T]he movie's simple, slightly clever premise gradually and finally collapses."
4961,1,Hypnotic often feels like a greatest hits compilation of sci-fi brain-teasers. That's forgivable as the plot gets progressively better and more interesting.
4962,0,"Strangely inert in many ways, occasionally showing signs of life when the movie locks into thriller mode, but these moments are sadly few and far between."
4963,0,"A mind-numbing, uneven and clunky mess that's not bad or campy enough to be a guilty pleasure B-movie."
4964,0,A new career low for Affleck and Rodriguez.
4965,1,"Hypnotic isn’t just refreshingly straightforward for Rodriguez, but for Ben Affleck too."
4966,0,Repeatedly pulling the rug out from under the audience is not the same as good plotting.
4967,1,"Imagine Christopher Nolan’s Memento if it had been rewritten by an escaped lunatic: voila, that’s Hypnotic, an entirely uproarious 90 minutes at the cinema which asks nothing more of its audience than that they keep their incredulity suspended..."
4968,0,"The film feels a little too late to the party when it comes to a concept taking you inside of the mind, however that ends up playing out. Were it a bit less muted in presentation, perhaps the film could have been a more stimulating cerebral exercise."
4969,1,"... director Francis Lawrence... and screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong turn out a surprisingly engaging film about rebellion, propaganda, media, and the emotional and psychological scars of war..."
4970,1,"Set aside criticisms about dividing the final film. Mockingjay Part 1 is a serviceable extrapolation of the series' interest in personal vs public responsibility & PTSD. The adult cast is stacked, though dir Lawrence's focus is clearly action over actors"
4971,1,"There are enjoyable moments, good characters, strong performances, and the knowledge that this is just a set-up to what should be an action-packed final film. But as a single standalone movie, I was definitely hoping for more."
4972,1,Director Lawrence doesn’t disappoint in elevating the series as a whole with this political-minded entry.
4973,1,"""Lawrence is simply marvelous again and delivers a surprisingly beautiful vocal performance that demonstrates her well-rounded talent as a performer."""
4974,1,There was no need for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay to be split into two different films...
4975,1,"Is Katniss Everdeen a hero? For most of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, the sequel grapples with this very question  a refreshing question that most gigantic blockbusters are afraid to ask."
4976,1,"[Mockingjay: Part 1] may lack some of the heavy action of its previous counterparts, but brings with it an inevitable and emotional evolution into a more mature story."
4977,1,The cinematic world created in the first two movies is about to change in very dramatic ways and this movie prepares viewers for the revolution.
4978,0,"The entire picture is simply a glimpse of grander events to come and a set-up for pathos and an eventual, epic culmination."
4979,1,It lacks the cohesive action and compelling spirit so evident in the first two films.
4980,0,"Since this is a 'Part 1 of 2,' it makes it difficult to address in a review. The problem with splitting a film into two pieces is you only get to see part of the whole."
4981,1,"Despite never reading the books, the greatest appeal about The Hunger Games franchise is that while it's aimed at a young teenage audience...there's enough material and context that makes it satisfying for adults."
4982,0,"While this can be entertaining to watch, and there are nice bits of spectacle level eye candy, including the destruction of a massive damn, the problem is that the film never becomes more than simply the first part in a larger saga."
4983,1,"'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1', the first part of the trilogy finale, is an impassive, mature, and sometimes dramatic sci-fi blockbuster. [Full review in Spanish]"
4984,1,"The director and writers don't have to cram so many plot incidents from the dense source material into a regulation-sized movie, and so they are able to stretch out and focus on their greatest strength: Lawrence."
4985,1,"Enjoy Mockingjay - Part One for the function it serves to set up the finale, and let's look forward to Mockingjay - Part Two. I think a year from now, hindsight will prove that we were all satisfied with The Middle Middle Child."
4986,1,"Although solidly packaged with, for the most part, solid performances, Mockingjay Part 1 feels restrained. The exuberance and anticipatory excitement within both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Catching Fire' is missing here."
4987,0,"Without the hook of its titular games in the mix, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1, plays like a rote dystopian thriller."
4988,1,"The Hunger Games films are worth revisiting; they're Y.A. dystopia done right, balancing fantastic and realistic elements well. They're also full of excellent performers."
4989,0,"Interesting for its drifting away from the formulaic model already established, yet it feels something like a misnomer of a film, more of an extended prologue to a finale rather an actual 'part' deserving of its own distinction."
4990,1,Commanded with correction and some brilliance by Francis Lawrence; performed in the same terms by a cast that I will highlight Donald Sutherland and Julianne Moore. [Full Review in Spanish]
4991,1,Director Francis Lawrence gets to the meat of what all The Hunger Games are about in Mockingjay part 1.
4992,1,"When absorbed into the series as a whole, this chapter supplies some of the most thought-provoking, sophisticated thematic content to ever find its way into so-called ""young adult"" science fiction."
4993,1,"As one film, Mockingjay could be much tighter and streamlined, but it feels drawn out and a little aimless."
4994,1,"The Hunger Games hasn't given birth to twins. Instead, it has stretched out the limbs of its concluding chapter to the point of cracking dislocation."
4995,1,"...ultimately Part One will go down as the film you sat through while you waited for the more exciting main event, the conclusion, due out this time next year."
4996,0,Collins' revolutionary-lite rhetoric has become unravelled by the commercially driven decision to split the final novel into two films -- ultimately lessening the satirical bite and reverting to the gender archetypes it originally sought to challenge.
4997,1,"Once more, the film is carried effortlessly by Lawrence."
4998,1,"This is a darker more detailed chapter, with less action and more political commentary. It's a slow build that proves to be quite interesting -- sort of an evolution of the revolution."
4999,1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I burns bright and explosively lays the groundwork for the revolution of all time, fueling the anticipation for an extraordinary endgame."
5000,1,"These films are at their best when they're working with small touches, and yet again, this is where they shine."
5001,1,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 builds on its promise to provide conscientious escapism for the topical fodder that holds so much truth in the disillusionment of authoritative scrutiny and societal disenchantment in today's political climate.
5002,1,"Aside from the pacing issues, it is otherwise as good a movie as the first two, but ... I can easily see this one being a bit tedious for some."
5003,1,"A mature, intelligent exploration of the effects of war, rebellion, and propaganda disguised as a YA Sci-Fi Adaptation that makes us hungry for the Games' final conclusion."
5004,1,"Not as strong as the previous films, which is to be expected for film telling only half of a story, but engaging enough to keep us rallied together for the finale."
5005,1,The meat of this franchise seems more in line with Edward Bernays than any fantasy or sci-fi author. This latest edition takes public relations to its bloodiest extreme.
5006,1,"All action, not causation or human psychology; it's sterile, jackboot that requires no acting just the ability to only shout or emote obviously."
5007,1,"Part I is setup; it's the Empire Strikes Back of the Hunger Games series, ending on a note of moderate success, tempered by loss and steeped in grief."
5008,1,"The action that was there, was brilliant, but I felt that Part 1 was more about building up and breaking down relationships, bravado and characters in such a way that leaves them stripped completely bare and battle worn ready for total upheaval in Part 2."
5009,0,Save that $11 and wait to see this one on Netflix.
5010,1,"Confirms what the first two movies already told us: that this series has taken what could have been a teen-exploitation premise and turned it into one of the most potent, and complicated, political narratives of our time."
5011,1,"The key lies in new screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong, who understand the value of the unspoken."
5012,1,"It's worth a watch thanks to its small pleasures (...) such as the acting, the special effects, and it's thematic content...[Full review in Spanish]"
5013,0,"Josh Hutcherson almost steals the movie from Jennifer Lawrence, who unfortunately doesn't have much to do, because well, not much actually happens in Mockingjay"
5014,1,"While it is not as fast-paced as its predecessors, this is however, essential for fans of the series."
5015,1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part One is very good indeed and all the better for featuring no Hunger Games at all."
5016,1,"The action audience may wish for less talking and more mayhem - but Mockingjay does enough as a transitional film, while getting us amped for what's to come."
5017,1,"[Mockingjay] is a strong story featuring a strong heroine, both trying to make their way through the ugly world that produced it."
5018,0,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 is as wanting for substance as it is craving more punctuation marks that glitter when they venture into the sunlight."
5019,1,"We're still waiting for the second half of the story, and until we get to see the whole thing, the force of its impact is getting greatly diminished."
5020,1,[Mockingjay Part 1] is quite good - if also the darkest and least accommodating in the series so far.
5021,1,"With Mockingjay Part 1, it's evolved into the rarest of breeds: a series that can carry sober and frightening messages about violence, gracefully and even beautifully."
5022,1,"This is certainly a film adults can get into. The explosions, propaganda techniques, and unrest are a reminder of a history not entirely out of reach; a world and society all too realistic. for many living today."
5023,1,It expands its dystopian universe in a way that's both thrilling to its young target audience as well as developing the social and political problems facing Panem in a way that's rather satisfying.
5024,1,"You couldn't really describe it as a fun, uplifting way to spend your evening, but more than either of its predecessors, Mockingjay Part 1 makes it clear why the Hunger Games continues to strike a nerve."
5025,1,"[Lawrence is] such a canny actress and she's so inside the character's head, it's hard not to get swept up in Katniss' confusion, heartache and outrage."
5026,0,"At its best, this half-Mockingjay details a kind of unhealthy propaganda therapy as Katniss and Peeta head toward their inevitable reunion. But it's not really enough to sustain a satisfying two-hour feature."
5027,1,"Before the war come the debates, and this blockbuster has enough intelligence to adequately prepare its troops for battle."
5028,1,"Considering the 'Hunger Games'' teen demographic, a somber, dark, political drama/grimy-bunker flick would seem guaranteed to adversely affect the holy Hollywood bottom line."
5029,1,"It may be the franchise's third movie, but it plays like its 'Empire Strikes Back.'"
5030,1,"It's still highly watchable, mainly because of the cast and the pawn-or-plotter dilemma that thrusts itself into Katniss's anxious existence. But.. it's hard not to feel that the material has been spread out too thin."
5031,0,Half a story stretched far too thin with a cast that has neither reason nor opportunity to stretch themselves.
5032,1,"Even when it's lacking in atmosphere and texture, Mockingjay still captivates thanks to the momentum it's constantly building."
5033,1,"This is the darkest and edgiest of the three Hunger Games movies, and the most satisfying."
5034,1,"Everyone is already on board with this saga or they're not, and this movie won't change anybody's minds. Since I'm one of the people who's on board, I'll be sticking around to see what the filmmakers do with the series' end."
5035,1,"Mockingjay, Part 1 might be the least of the films so far, but in dissecting the typical blockbuster film, it's staying true to that spirit."
5036,0,"The Hunger Games movies have hit that emotional note, pitting Peeta against Gale, distracting Katniss with young-adultish emotional havoc. Whether it distracts you is the question."
5037,1,"It's Lawrence who drives this thing, and she's riveting. She's the one who carries the pic's emotional weight, expertly conveying Katniss's maturity and growing resolve."
5038,1,"Thank heavens, then, for Lawrence. Even though the storyline lacks conviction, she has the passionate intensity of the kind of leader you might just be willing to follow into one more film."
5039,1,"Mockingjay Part 1 is a thoughtful, smart blockbuster of weight sure to challenge its younger target audience and entertain grown-ups too."
5040,0,"When your protagonist is watching the third act of your movie play out on a TV monitor, you should know you have a problem."
5041,0,Mockingjay Part 1's biggest problem is that it really feels like half a movie.
5042,1,I appreciated its more downbeat intellectual grasp of how wars can be fought through film and media.
5043,0,"A very odd film that ends as abruptly as it begins, so I guess we must all tune in next year to find out if it actually amounts to anything. This is just how big movies work now."
5044,0,A franchise inches toward its conclusion
5045,1,"It may not have the visual panache of the first two films, but it makes up for it with a thrilling series of events that set us up nicely for the final film in the franchise."
5046,0,"They didn't go full Hobbit on us, but [Mockingjay] should have been one film."
5047,1,"It feels like Lionsgate are killing time rather than driving forward, so hopefully the long-term success of the franchise isn't harmed by a short-term money grab."
5048,1,"Increasingly, in a world of ISIS, we know evil exists and is not going away. Maybe we need symbols to inspire us."
5049,0,"""The Hunger Games"" are almost over. We are near the end. And, I see a world where all are dandified with smelly leotards and jazzy wigs. It's the future, baby."
5050,0,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay is just a long, slow teaser for next year's grand finale, Mockingjay - Part 2."
5051,1,"Although well-acted, cleverly executed, and spiked with a couple of series-high moments, Mockingjay, Part 1 is not nearly as exciting as the films that preceded it"
5052,1,"That Jennifer Lawrence and her co-stars can prop up what is essentially half an epic and have us say ""more please"" is testament to their talents and that of director Francis Lawrence"
5053,1,Delivers a decent preview of the big finish coming in the final chapter.
5054,0,an adaptation of a book about a teenage girl navigating the seas of her rising estral tides
5055,1,"It shares some structural similarities with other penultimate franchise films ... [and] by necessity, will leave you less than satisfied when the credits roll."
5056,0,"This half-a-novel adaptation bides its time and, in doing so, diminishes its heroine."
5057,1,A solid lead-up to the finale.
5058,1,"As far as detached setups go, this is a movie that effectively rouses our suspicions into something of dogged interest."
5059,0,"To borrow the term from a friend, this latest instalment in the Hunger Games series is suffering from ""part-one-itis."""
5060,1,"Doesn't make us want to see more final films split into two parts, but it makes the decision to do so in this instance feel absolutely warranted."
5061,1,This is arguably the best installment in the franchise because the love triangle is put on the back burner in favor of deeper themes.
5062,0,"It's a prologue without an epilogue, an introduction without a conclusion, 120 minutes of setup without a proper climax. In other words, it's a drag."
5063,0,"a whole lot of set-up for what we imagine will be payoff in Part 2, which doesn't necessarily make it any easier to slog through"
5064,1,"In transforming Katniss from victim/champion to icon and expanding the stakes from personal survival to political revolution, this third film sacrifices some of the metaphorical power of its teen-centric predecessors..."
5065,1,"Better than the first, not as good as the second."
5066,0,So much of this one feels disposable in the grand scheme of things.
5067,0,"The film's commitment to market concerns over storytelling ones is vividly obvious throughout all of its aimless, airless minutes."
5068,1,This sequel-split rests on the time-tested theory that there's money to be raked in by extending the life of characters who had us from the first arrow.
5069,1,(offers) an authenticity to the subject matter that big budget films often struggle to achieve. It’s a joy from start to finish
5070,1,A raunchy yet endearing teen comedy that’ll have to relish in its outlandish humor.
5071,1,…Interested in Bottoms? Why wouldn’t you be? This raucous teen comedy is a female-driven variant on Superbad that has a unique voice and raucous style all of its own…
5072,1,"I admire the risks it takes—not only because some still don't enjoy LGBTQ stories (which is unfortunate), but also because its mix of irony, violence, blood, politically incorrect jokes and stereotypes will not appeal to everyone. Full review in Spanish."
5073,1,It’s hard not to be charmed by its unapologetic silliness even if its broad approach to its formula doesn’t leave a lot of room for character development or narrative surprise.
5074,1,"Bottoms has the potential to be a cult classic with a specific core audience, especially those in the queer community."
5075,1,"It’s exciting when something like Bottoms comes along, committed to underdogs of all sorts and turning accepted modes of discourse on their ass."
5076,0,"While Bottoms has raunchy and raucous white lesbian humor, any aspect outside deviates to a cliche, invisible, or worse, a punchline."
5077,1,"It’s confounding, haywire, absurd and spectacular... Bottoms has all the makings of a cult classic in the sense that it is beloved by many, and misunderstood or disliked by everyone else."
5078,1,"There are some silly plot points, but the film is raucously funny thanks to its sheer absurdity, and Sennott and Edebiri are deadpan excellence personified."
5079,1,"There is much to enjoy with Bottoms. There’s a distinct sense that it could have pushed harder, gone further with its jokes, but thanks to a charming cast, Seligman’s sophomore film is a winner."
5080,1,"I wish I had found Emma Seligman’s movie funnier, because I did find it sparky and likeable."
5081,1,"Real-life friends Sennott and Edebiri are harmonious in ways that relieve them of the need to land flat-out punchlines. Instead, they just sweat funny out of their pores."
5082,1,"Bottoms is a sharp, painfully funny and exuberant addition to the high-school movie hall of fame."
5083,1,Smart and very silly.
5084,1,"Even if the scattershot plotting doesn’t quite hold together, there’s a wayward energy to the picture and a barbed sense of mischief."
5085,1,In Bottoms... you’ll find more crude sex jokes than you can shake a pom-pom at. It’s also bizarrely violent.
5086,0,"Bottoms tries to shock by showing girls being beaten up, while remaining largely conventional."
5087,0,Narrative clarity is jettisoned in favour of wearisome storytelling incoherence in a queer high-school comedy that’s one of the least effective entries of the genre.
5088,1,"Just occasionally the parody falls flat, making Bottoms a hit-and-miss comedy, but the hits more than compensate for the misses..."
5089,1,Think Mean Girls mashed into Lindsay Anderson’s If ... But with more sublimated high-feminist discourse. Just perfect.
5090,1,"Not all the jokes work but Edebiri and Sennott have great comic timing, there are some sharp lines, and the unhinged energy is hard to resist."
5091,0,"Sorry, where is the comedy in this comedy?"
5092,0,"We haven’t come a long way since Superbad (2007), except for the welcome twist that gay girls get to dominate in this ensemble. Trouble is, the relationships don’t make sense, and the film’s recourse to violent slapstick feels lazy, not liberated."
5093,1,"It all plays like a moderately scuffed-up and entirely non-heterosexual version of Olivia Wilde’s Booksmart – though no one in this film shows the smallest interest in books, certainly not the teachers."
5094,1,"An incredibly silly, sapphic, gloriously weird high-school satire. Bottoms’ ultra-knowing tone might be a struggle for some — but it’s hilariously rewarding."
5095,1,Ayo Edebiri and Rachel Sennott are sensational in this absurdly fun and subversive teen comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]
5096,1,"The characters are confused and frustrated, but ultimately so much wiser than I could ever imagine being at 16."
5097,1,"Bottoms comes up on top with a deliciously twisted sense of humour, impressive film craft, and an approach to satire that leaves nothing unchecked, not even its own existence as entertainment."
5098,0,"It didn’t resonate with me, but at least the cast appears to have had a blast in this feminist celebration of love, youth, and friendship."
5099,1,"It’s difficult to describe what makes comedy work, but Bottoms works. It captures a specific and wicked tone that stretches the limits of the imagination without ever crossing into it."
5100,0,"I was rooting for Bottoms to be a winning spin on the underdog tale, but the film is strong coffee from the get-go: grating and garish and loud but rarely funny."
5101,0,"Is it “Superbad” or “Jawbreaker”? The screenplay doesn’t seem to ever decide on a direction, which hinders the film, reducing it to something of a chore, and often a bore."
5102,1,"Seligman’s loosey-goosey approach to tone and plotting feels carefully designed to keep us off-kilter and therefore vulnerable to the film’s brand of blindside, kidney-punch comedy."
5103,1,Of course I loved it!
5104,1,"Bottoms, a wild, oft-violent, sexually liberated high-school comedy that honours John Hughes as much as it punches his mentality in the face."
5105,1,"Through its heady combination of heart, sharp dialogue and irrepressible defiance of the conventional, it turns the typical high school comedy on its head with a full-on sucker punch."
5106,1,"'Bottoms' is never afraid to have fun, even when it comes at the cost of a reasonable plot or political correctness. It's an hysterical teen movie featuring two of the best talents of this generation."
5107,1,"Seligman and Sennott don’t take their premise the whole way, leading to some disappointment, but they have something here that’s quite different at times, and uproarious when it wants to be."
5108,1,"If you can handle the edgy jokes that would get a Tumblr user canceled in a heartbeat, Bottoms will make you laugh until you cry in the best way possible."
5109,1,"A totally unhinged teen sex comedy, with very little sex and an obscene amount of comedy. More Ayo Edibiri in everything, please. [Full Review in Spanish]"
5110,1,"The result is a film that sometimes feels hollow, but it’s so hilarious and shocking that it’s still pretty easy to love."
5111,1,"Bottoms moves at a relentless pace, tossing out one-liners like firecrackers."
5112,1,"Bottoms is one of the greatest high school narratives of the twenty-first century, a triumph of queer cinema."
5113,1,"One of the best comedies of the year, immediately entering any list of films about young people getting into trouble looking for sexy time, never falling into vulgar, but also not afraid to throwing down the dirty. [Full review in Spanish]"
5114,1,"Rachel Sennott, Ayo Edebiri, and Molly Gordon have crafted a comedic vibe all their own, and with the release of Bottoms, it grows ever stronger."
5115,1,"This fight club group's final actions in the movie reminded me a bit of the final defiant actions in Animal House. The fight club's final stand is not quite as pointless as that of Delta Tau Chi's, but it is equally outrageous."
5116,1,"Having beaten Everything Everywhere All At Once’s opening-week take and with a continued solid box-office, Bottoms won’t win any Oscars but the film just might prove to the powers that be that sapphic cinema is a money-making proposition."
5117,1,"The characters are relatable, the humor generates laughter without becoming moronic, and the feel-good vibe is never far from the surface."
5118,1,"A hilarious, original, must-see queer teen comedy."
5119,1,"Seligman and Sennott’s script is bracingly funny, skewering the high-school-as-life intensity and the baked-in misogyny of that generation of teen comedies."
5120,1,"You do need to get on its wavelength to enjoy it to the fullest. It probably skews too crazy for my own liking, but I had a smile on my face throughout and laughed out loud enough to become a legitimate fan."
5121,0,"A seriously, pervasively annoying piece of work..."
5122,0,"Forget punching up or punching down: Bottoms keeps its hands open, rarely landing a slap."
5123,1,"I’ve been waiting for the campy, horny queer romp we deserve for years. And with Bottoms, I’ve finally gotten it."
5124,1,Bottoms is a boisterous and biting teen comedy that’s very on-the-nose and over-the-top about high school being a violent hellscape of social hierarchies and skin-tingling horniness.
5125,0,This promised to be a raunchy teen sex comedy but is ultimately an unfunny film about two teens trying to navigate the ups and downs of friendship.
5126,1,A smart and audacious parody of toxic masculinity and modern feminism
5127,1,"On paper, nothing about Bottoms should work, but with Seligman and this talented cast willing to do whatever it takes, the film winds up being a generational teenage comedy that sets the bar high for future films in the genre."
5128,1,"The script is flipped, prodded and detonated to fashion a whole new animal of delicious high jinks. Soak up its cheekiness and wit."
5129,1,"It's kind of a throwback to 80's raunchy teen comedies, but updated to today's world with Rachel Sennnott and Ayo Edebri who have fantastic comedic timing.  Both of these actors are fun to watch play off each other."
5130,1,"The movie's such a Mad Magazine-style parody of high school, much of it felt like farce for the sake of farce. Then again, maybe that's the point; many people will tell you that high school was the most absurd, insane time of their lives."
5131,1,"Generation X was blessed with (John) Hughes’ ""Breakfast Club."" Years from now, I can see a whole new generation of young people — and young lesbians, in particular — listing “Bottoms” as one of the most impactful films of their youth."
5132,1,Just gather your nonsqueamish WLW friends and go see Bottoms immediately.
5133,1,"A Fight Club meets Superbad riff, Bottoms is a violent & riotous R-rated romp, proving once more that Rachel Sennott & Ayo Edebiri are stars."
5134,1,"The stop and start pacing and scenes that don’t really flow into one another work against “Bottoms.” For all its cheekiness and wit, this isn’t clever or cutting on a “Heathers” or “Booksmart” or “Election” level."
5135,1,"For all that it is dumb on purpose, weird beyond belief—you thought Barbie was weird? Buckle up—and swimming in hormones and horniness, Bottoms is clever about its message."
5136,1,Seligman and Sennott drop the funniest comedy of the year. Think estrogen-fueled “Superbad” with laugh-out-loud moments.
5137,1,"These characters are a mess, yet their messiness is a triumph for contemporary teen cinema."
5138,1,"Ayo Edebiri and Rachel Sennott lead a talented cast on a rough and tumble high school experience, filled with irony and cringiness, but also a massive helping of truth."
5139,1,"Seligman and the crew pack a punch in the gut for audiences, and you’ll go down laughing."
5140,1,"Gets some shocked chuckles, but they don’t come a mile and minute."
5141,1,"[Bottoms] hijacks the traditional Hollywood third act and bathes it in a sort of queer elixir, unveiling a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors that represents the most exciting, freeing, and ingenious storytelling of the year."
5142,1,"Not pulling any punches, Shiva Baby director Emma Seligman reteams with star Rachel Sennott for a sophomore slugfest that expertly pummels high school parodies."
5143,0,"The tone is all wrong here, the approach so heavy-handed and obvious, it robs the message of its thunder."
5144,1,"Like the greats of the genre, namely Heathers and Mean Girls, Bottoms lampoons the inherent tropes, but does so with such reckless abandon that it cements an identity all its own."
5145,1,A comedy so beautifully anarchic it feels like clapter's death rattle.
5146,1,"Bottoms goes for the gusto in its storytelling, making its plot weird in all the best ways. Quotable dialogue and a slew of great performances make it a film that will be talked about for years to come if it finds the right audience."
5147,1,"Not great, but quirky and funny."
5148,1,We went from “I love my dead gay son” in Heathers to a comedy that plays every note on the Kinsey scale. This absolutely feels like the kind of low-budget gem destined to be a generational touchpoint for decades to come.
5149,1,"It surprised me repeatedly with its direction, tone, and sharp writing, to the point where it seems of the utmost importance that Seligman and Sennott never stop working together."
5150,1,I kind of loved it.
5151,1,"With her second feature, Seligman is reaching for more than just observational comedy. Inspired by movies such as the satirical and silly Wet Hot American Summer, the world of Bottoms is skewed and unhinged."
5152,1,"Bottoms comes out swinging hard and never lets up. It’s a hilarious sex comedy, a terrific queer high school movie, and a platform for some of the funniest and most talented actors in Hollywood right now."
5153,1,"With “Bottoms,” there is a fresh, innocence to the gay teen comedy where the sex is consensual and “no” means “no.”"
5154,1,"Bottoms movie is the quintessential over exaggerated instant coming of age soon to be a cult classic! Hilarious, WILD, Bloody, & AWESOME! I loved my time with Emma Seligman’s Vision!   Rachel & Ayo are the dynamic duo of 2023!"
5155,1,"Bottoms isn’t perfect but it’s fast, crazy, and a lot of fun."
5156,1,"Yes, ""Bottoms"" is well worth seeing. And, yes, it is the funniest movie of the year."
5157,1,"I loved every twisted, hilarious minute of the violent high school comedy “Bottoms” because, as I’ve told you more than once, I’m a sicko."
5158,1,"But with gags that land often enough to keep viewers chortling and a plot and setting full of surprises, Bottoms utterly belies its name."
5159,1,"Seligman’s tone, her image of high school and high school movies, is wildly, irreverently funny and fearless. It’s hilarious, raunchy, and so much fun."
5160,1,"This movie is insane. It's intense and absurd, but also deadpan in a surreal kind of way. It exists within what seems like a recognizable high school setting, but is totally heightened in bizarro ways that remind me of Heathers."
5161,1,"Bottoms is something of  a rimshot off the raucous, sometimes sex-crazed high school hijinks of Heathers, Porky’s, American Pie and more recently, Booksmart, topped with a dousing of social commentary."
5162,1,[Director/co-writer Emma Seligman] infuses this thing with enough energy to carry it over its rough patches.
5163,1,Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott’s script masterfully keeps Bottoms constantly walking that line between a grounded reality of Gen-Z adolescence and an over-the-top comedy wacky comedy.
5164,1,"Yes, Bottoms is absurd at times, but it is also full of heart. Bottoms deserves to be a mainstream success and will certainly become an instant cult classic."
5165,1,"In short, Bottoms is nuts."
5166,1,"It’s far from perfect, but its bold take on empowerment is something that should be cherished."
5167,1,"Already looking to become a bit of a cult comedy favorite ala Heathers, and I can’t recommend this enough if you really want to laugh… a lot."
5168,1,"[T]he film is funny because it dares to be both ridiculous and uneasy, pushing us to see the world through a warped but eerily in-focus lens."

5204,1,"It takes a while for this film to find its footing, but once Awkwafina and Oh's talents mesh the movie takes off."
5205,0,"It’s not at all laugh-free, as a lot of goofy gags land, so it’s worth checking out in the realm of random comedy streaming releases, but the price just wasn’t always right for me."
5206,1,...the picture grows more and more compelling (and agreeable) as it unfolds.
5207,1,This slapstick light entertainment works because of the zingers in the script and the fine performances of all of the well-cast actors.
5208,1,"Ultimately Quiz Lady offers pat answers, phrased in a pleasantly diverting manner."
5209,1,"This breezy, energetic sibling comedy lark will bring smiles aplenty...Things move quickly in this brisk, very funny jaunt that is smart enough to deliver a handful of scenes amidst all the antics that give the high jinks a touch of character depth."
5210,1,"Awkwafina + Sandra Oh are such a dynamic duo, making the funny one-liners come alive in this wonderfully kooky comedy."
5211,1,"Structurally “Quiz Lady” is rather a mess, but it’s a generally amusing one, largely because of the pairing of Awkwafina and Oh, Ferrell’s charm, and a good supporting cast."
5212,1,"While there really isn’t a realistic moment in this bumpy and broad comedy, it still manages to win more than its share of laughs thanks to a game cast."
5213,1,"Considering the impressive roster of actors, I know it shouldn’t be such a surprise, but Quiz Lady is a wildly heartwarming and hilarious ride from beginning to end."
5214,0,"Bully for underrepresented creators making a movie the ruling class has been making since pictures started moving, I guess. Progress ain't what it used to be."
5215,1,A story with heart that will stay with you long after the credits roll and Quiz Lady pulls it off.
5216,1,"Quiz Lady is unlikely to change anyone’s life, but it’s a vehicle for compelling performances with some good laughs and an unexpected emotional core."
5217,1,"In lesser hands, this homage to game show fandom and its message of sisterly togetherness might have been unbearably corny, but the story delivers the sweetness minus the cloying aftertaste."
5218,0,But the severity of their predicament is understandably laughed off because this film really wants to keep things light.
5219,1,Awkwafina and Sandra Oh prove a match made in comedy heaven in this sweet romp from director Jessica Yu.
5220,1,Quiz Lady is a fun comedy and something that should entertain at home over the weekend or whenever you watch it on Disney+.
5221,1,"It’s not always perfect, and many roads it chooses to go down are left hanging as outliers. But the film nails the parts it’s good at and allows its leads to enhance their overall arcs to satisfying effect."
5222,1,Sandra Oh and Awkafina are absolutely hilarious in this. There's heart and charm to Quiz Lady that makes it well worth a watch.
5223,0,It becomes too predictable except for a few quirky moments.
5224,1,Jessica Yu’s latest film has many strong bits of comedy but is never funny throughout. That has a lot to do with writer Jen D’Angelo’s focus being aimed more at the endearing relationship at the film’s center.
5225,1,"The film perfectly intertwines laugh-out-loud scenes with heartfelt moments, making this one of the best feel-good comedies of the year."
5226,0,A heartfelt but uneven shrug that probably should have been better than it is.
5227,1,"Quiz Lady is a potpourri lightning round of jokes, and the highly effective comedy duo of Oh and Awkwafina execute them expertly."
5228,0,The two actresses make it easy to watch: the sisters’ bond is quite sweet. But the film’s bland humour probably won’t have a big place in the world’s collective memory.
5229,0,"The cast keeps enunciating lines that are clearly meant to be funny, but simply are not (“My armpits are like Niagara Falls,” says Awkwafina, holding a beat for the laugh that will never, ever come)."
5230,1,"Overall, Quiz Lady is an infectious comedy with plenty of heart, but missed a real opportunity to flesh out the childhood trauma angle with darker comedy that could have given the film greater depth."
5231,1,"While writer Jen D’Angelo and director Jessica Yu’s follow a rather predictable path and may be a little too risqué for some (and bland for others), it does bring together a terrific comedy double act – and makes terrific use of their undoubted chemistry."
5232,1,The film excels when it focuses on the sibling dynamic and the televised trivia show. Sometimes it gets bogged down in an overly complicated side plot but the performances and humor make it worth a watch.
5233,1,"A very silly movie, which you may sometimes need more than you actually want."
5234,1,"Quiz Lady projects enough charm as an overall feature that we are more than willing to go along on the ride with Awkwafina and, especially, Oh."
5235,1,"…everyone likes it when women are funny, and Oh, Awkwafina, D’Angelo and Yu generate the big laughs in Quiz Lady that an upbeat, undemanding comedy requires…"
5236,0,Quiz Lady is the kind of comedy that ought to work on paper but mostly flubs its execution.
5237,0,... generates some scattered big laughs from a broad mix of sight gags and one-liners — as well as its tweaking of cultural stereotypes — but the odd-couple chemistry between the estranged sisters wears thin before the bonus round.
5238,1,Quiz Lady is hilariously charming. The film mixes up elements of slapstick and situational comedy without falling into the trap of being too ridiculous.
5239,1,"Jessica Yu's ""Quiz Lady"" became one of a few genuine crowd-pleasers at Toronto's 48th annual September showcase of movies, particularly with its moving, special-guest ending that, of course, will not be given away here."
5240,1,"Friendly, ephemeral, somewhat predictable and conventional, but ultimately quite effective in making people laugh. [Full review in Spanish]"
5241,1,"Awkwafina is a human hydroelectric complex: use all the power you need, there’s charge to spare... the kind of tonally eclectic, swing-often-for-the-fences comedy tailor-made for sustaining the theatrical audience for laughter."
5242,1,"Not every joke lands, but with the movie’s quick pace and the powerful chemistry of its lead actors, the misfires don’t bog the film down."
5243,0,"Wasted opportunities abound in Jen D’Angelo’s script, as if they writer just had the courage to sneak up on good ideas only to back away timidly from them, unsure as to how to develop them."
5244,1,Awkwafina and Sandra Oh are a hoot in Quiz Lady.
5245,1,"It may not be laugh-out-loud funny at every turn, but Quiz Lady, with an irresistible cast, is entertaining with just the right amount of heart."
5246,1,"While certain parts needs fine-tuning, Quiz Lady offers bouts of laughs and heartfelt moments with some winning performances."
5247,1,"Funny is funny, and this film is pretty funny ... Much of that is thanks to its two leads."
5248,1,"Awkwafina and Sandra Oh are hilarious, displaying excellent comedic timing that transitions to touching moments in a blink, creating hard and soft edges for their respective characters."
5249,1,"Though Quiz Lady’s gags are sparse, they pair just nicely enough with the film’s big, beating heart to satisfy viewers looking for a perfectly enjoyable but instantly forgettable night on the couch."
5250,1,"It is clear that both of them had a blast making this outrageous comedy, which makes it all the more fun for us."
5251,1,"Eccentric, energetic, and frequently laugh out loud hilarious, Quiz Lady makes wonderful use of sharp writing and a pair of perfectly cast stars working against their usual type."
5252,1,Not all of the jokes land in this by-the-numbers broad comedy but the spirited performances of the fantastic ensemble cast make it a winner worthy of a casual watch.
5253,1,"Quiz Lady distinguishes itself enough from other films of its ilk by leaning into its familiar structure and tropes, ending up pretty funny and surprisingly sincere."
5254,0,"Good premise, bumpy ride."
5255,1,"It’s a success because of its well-crafted screenplay from Jen D’Angelo, Yu’s directing, and each and every performer who brings their all to a simple plot that’s brimming with sadder undertones of negligence and desires to be seen."
5256,1,"Like so many road trip buddy comedies, the effectiveness of the enterprise rests, arguably more than the writing or direction itself, on the balance and chemistry between the central duo."
5257,0,"A strange viewing experience, with Yu navigating some distinct highs and lows with the effort, which is charming enough at times, but never quite lands its major laughs."
5258,1,"This isn’t highbrow comedy, but it is effective at being both funny and sincere, as the rowdy quiz-show scheme serves to bring the sisters together."
5259,1,"... smart(ish), funny, and effortlessly charming"
5260,1,"Quiz Lady works as a congenial fusion of disparate characters, wacky encounters, sight gags, and clever jabs at Asian racial stereotypes. Stars Awkwafina and Sandra Oh tickle funny bones and warm hearts as stalwart opposites who find common ground."
5261,1,"Awkwafina and Sandra Oh still find the humor and heart even when placed in outrageous situations that stretch suspension of disbelief too far, even for a film as deliberately silly as this one"
5262,0,"Documentarian Jessica Yu... struggles with an uneven script peppered with low-hanging fruit gags, implausible set-ups and a random blast of drug humor, and completely blows the Big Finish that the title “Quiz” promises us."
5263,1,"Awkwafina awkwardly takes a back seat to Oh's physical comedy in Quiz Lady. But overall, I needed more commitment to the Asian American experience. Good but not memorable."
5264,1,A goofy comedy about sisterhood that delivers a bubbly burst of feel-good entertainment.
5265,1,Quiz Lady is a breezy comedy with fun role reversals for Awkwafina and Sandra Oh.
5266,0,"Quiz Lady is chock full of talent, but even the strongest of filmmakers can’t elevate a weak script."
5267,1,"Awkwafina and Oh are terrific together, and they’re supported by a cast that includes a few fun standouts."
5268,1,Sandra Oh and Awkwafina are the comedic duo of the year in this hilarious and heartfelt film.
5269,1,Sandra Oh and Awkwafina compliment each other's strength effortlessly making Quiz Lady absolutely hysterical with a dark realistic edge leaving siblings and parents all over the globe holding up a mirror to  themselves for the truth that lies underneath.
5270,1,"Familiarity is not always a bad thing when a movie makes you feel good, and Quiz Lady definitely succeeded in making me feel good."
5271,1,"Some jokes fall flat, some punch the gut, and a few keep you laughing minutes after the scene has ended. It's a kooky story that gets some time in the sun for its no-holds-barred approach to comedy without sacrificing the talent of its ensemble cast."
5272,1,"While the film wobbles along the way, when they get to the third act, it's game on for good times."
5273,0,"Awkwafina and Sandra Oh are dynamite performers who have proven themselves across film and TV, which makes it all the more disappointing that neither of them can make Quiz Lady work."
5274,0,Quiz Lady has a fun presentation but seeks sharper execution. [Full review in Spanish]
5275,1,"The performances throughout ""Quiz Lady"" are an absolute treat, as Awkwafina and Sandra Oh put their all into the hilarious, quirky sister characters who are the complete antithesis of one another."
5276,1,"Quiz Lady is an enjoyable movie, you’ll simply forget about right afterward."
5277,1,"Playing to the beat of ‘90s buddy comedies through witty dialogue and sharp slapstick humor, it manages to balance the laughs with strong, relationship drama for a spirited film about sisterhood rarely celebrated on the big screen."
5278,1,"Quiz Lady is a mixed bag, but entertaining."
5279,1,"You watch Awkwafina in these sequences and think ah, yes, this must have been what it was like to see Michelangelo approach a block of marble."
5280,1,"With Canada's sweetheart Sandra Oh and Awkwafina as the estranged pair, it makes for a ride where you know most of the stops and destinations, but the view is just different enough to provide for good laughs."
5281,1,Quiz Lady is a film that wears its silly contrivances and heart proudly. It may not be consistently funny — the jokes start to feel one-note by the end — but fine performances from its stacked cast will make it an appealing Friday night option...
5282,1,"While Yu doesn’t always balance the zany physical comedy and earnest family drama she aims for, and D’Angelo’s script is packed with far too many threads, the film works largely thanks to the irrepressible charm of star Sandra Oh."
5283,0,"Ultimately Quiz Lady is a fun premise seeking a sharper execution — unlike the brilliant Anne, Yu and her cast don’t have all the answers."
5284,1,"The odd couple... shares a sensational chemistry, building on the base amusement of seeing Oh let her extension-laden hair down and Awkwafina crimp the straight-man character into weird new shapes."
5285,1,"This isn’t an awards movie and it’s hardly on a level with the best comic films to debut at this year’s fall festivals, but it may well go down easy when it hits the streamers."
5286,1,"Given its 127-minute runtime, “Spirited” could have been even better if director Sean Anders had trimmed some of the self-referential humor and fully embraced the holiday spirit."
5287,1,"While there’s no such thing as too many Christmas Carol adaptations, Apple TV’s Spirited falls a bit short in its emotional heart as it focuses more closely on the music and the comedic beats."
5288,1,"Spirited is a missed opportunity, but it’s an enjoyable enough film nonetheless, and it’s still bound to give you “that Christmas morning feelin'” and put you in a good mood."
5289,1,"Spirited is a fun and special film that feels both timely and classic. The humor is solid and the jokes are equal parts provocative, silly, and family friendly."
5290,1,"Spirited is a brilliant holiday film meant for an adult audience, packed with some great jokes, lively performances, catchy musical numbers, and topped off with an emotional ending I wasn’t really prepared for."
5291,1,Octavia Spencer is giving me life as a romantic lead and singing her face off in this holiday musical comedy reminding audiences that a choice can always change your life and sometimes for the better
5292,1,"All in all, this spiritual intervention, powered by silly antics and autotuned singing, ultimately delivers an entertaining – and at times, even interesting – take on the classic Christmas tale."
5293,1,"A big-hearted albeit goofy reimagining of Charles Dickens's Christmas classic, filled with lively and entertaining musical numbers."
5294,1,"Spirited revels in being a campy, musical reimagining of A Christmas Carol. The movie combines formulaic comedy with unexpected plot twists and catchy songs. The cast members also look like they're having fun, which brings some enjoyment to watching."
5295,1,"All in all, this one is an uneven Christmas endeavor with amusing moments thanks to the two leads and the always lovely Octavia Spencer as Ferrell’s love interest."
5296,0,A horrifically bloated 127 minutes.
5297,1,Elf scribe David Berenbaum puts a whimsical spin on a thoroughly enjoyable Charles Dickens holiday staple.
5298,1,It’s easy to see how Spirited could enter the Christmas circulation as a flawed but entertaining holiday favourite.
5299,0,"The most consistent pleasures in this uneven movie are when Ferrell and Reynolds are onscreen together, comically insulting each other."
5300,0,It is a bizarre and somewhat grotesque rewriting of the story’s moral...  seen through the lens of bothsiderism.
5301,1,"‘…Like it or not, Spirited is likely to join the pantheon of festive favourites; it may be overstuffed, but then again, overstuffed is partly what a holiday like this is all about….’"
5302,0,"It’s big, obnoxious and has (shudder) a lot of musical numbers delivered with outrageously enthusiastic choreography."
5303,1,"An early swing to the holiday season, ""Spirited"" is better than it has any right to be, even if the script does need a tad more fine-tuning."
5304,1,"Just when you thought Dickens' story couldn’t endure another fresh take, along come Will Ferrell & Ryan Reynolds in “Spirited,” focusing not merely on a Scrooge figure but the behind-the-scenes operation of the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present & Future."
5305,1,The presence of these two greats of contemporary comedy [Will Ferrel and Ryan Reynolds] sets this film apart. [Full review in Spanish]
5306,1,"What keeps this well-made and shrewdly written affair eminently watchable throughout are the sincerely upbeat energy levels Ferrell and Reynolds keep hitting with their roles, and a quality collection of very catchy tunes...and very cheesy dance routines."
5307,1,"You don't come out humming these tunes, but it's very self-referential in ways I think worked."
5308,0,"It just keeps going, my goodness."
5309,1,This somewhat chaotic musical variation on A Christmas Carol makes up for its lack of focus with energy and goodwill to spare.
5310,1,"Reynolds and Ferrell are a lot. Pasek and Paul's songs move the movie even upward. The dancing, comedy, and full supporting cast put it over the top."
5311,1,"As usual, Ryan Reynolds carries the film in his pocket. Clint's sarcasm suits him perfectly and he even seems to enjoy the dancing. [Full review in Spanish]"
5312,1,"Both Ferrell and Reynolds are darn good singers, which I didn't expect, and keep the fire behind the musical element burning. There are a bit too many lazy Ferrell jokes (clothing too tight, fish out of water etc.) but this is merry and bright. Holidaze!"
5313,0,Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds both seem to enjoy a genuine screen talent for pushing buttons that can turn them from obnoxious to agreeable and back again.
5314,1,...the comedic chemistry between Reynolds and Ferrell kept me smiling throughout.
5315,1,"Delivering a crap-talking Christmas musical with a heart of gold is no small feat & even though Spirited isn’t a great movie, it is still a good time."
5316,1,"Likely to be the most pleasant shock you’ll get during the 2022 festive season, Spirited presents a deliriously inventive, funny & heart-warming musical reworking of A Christmas Carol, one of the most remarkable and remakeable stories in literary history."
5317,0,"If you’re re-telling the umpteenth version of the same story, it shouldn’t take more than two hours to do it regardless of the detours and small surprises plotted."
5318,1,"The first half of the film is rough, with lackluster musical numbers that don't camouflage the fact that the stars cannot sing or dance well. If you can stick it out for about an hour, everything from that point until the end is actually a lot of fun."
5319,1,"A charming, heartfelt & witty modern take on the holiday classic with some cool twists & turns. Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell, both singing & dancing here, are great. In my book, a new Christmas classic. [Full review in Spanish]"
5320,1,"Reynolds and Ferrell give it their all, and it's a blast."
5321,0,"A colossal dud, one tragically short on laughs, and unable to do anything interesting or constructive with its source material."
5322,1,The plot is overstuffed and the drama lacks heart but the film's offbeat charms are hard to resist.
5323,1,"Despite a few missteps, Spirited will likely be crowned as the best of the new Christmas films in 2022. It’s rather difficult to be cynical when the movie is this much fun."
5324,1,"Spirited may not be destined to become a lasting Christmas classic, but it will certainly bring you plenty of joy this Christmas."
5325,1,It’s a silly musical with a silly story and fans of both Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds will very likely love it.
5326,1,"When you have Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds playing off each other, they're doing their usual shtick, good chemistry. If you want a light, cheery, easy, and funny movie, you will like it."
5327,1,“Spirited” is a jaunty affair.
5328,1,"... It manages to not only stand out in a crowd of Carols, but it also reimagines the structure and spirit (lol) of the original in such a manner as to justify its own existence."
5329,1,"It’s a funny, bouncy romp with strong singing and dancing talent and just the right touch of snark to please any Scrooge."
5330,1,It’s a heck of a risk but it works like a charm with not too many songs and plenty of comedy from Ferrell and Reynolds.
5331,1,"It’s a blast. I loved it. My younger kids loved it. And my older kid -- who hates everything -- loved it, too."
5332,1,“Spirited” is riotous fun that takes off on its source without denigrating it.
5333,0,There’s a delightfully eccentric song called Good Afternoon that rocks... The rest of the film is a turgid yawn that struggles with its too-high concept.
5334,0,"This over-produced, hyperactive romp does not know when to quit its self-satisfied meta jokes or sentimental life lessons, so insistent it is on whipping up manufactured seasonal cheer."
5335,0,"SPIRITED is a rather fresh take on the Charles Dickens' classic, but the lackluster musical piece weighs everything down."
5336,1,"Spirited may be overly concerned with incorporating as many musical numbers as possible in the beginning, but once it slows down and allows the emotions to build, there is some heart that shines through."
5337,1,I enjoyed the flick from start to finish and am fairly confident I had a smile or at least a grin on my face for most of the just over two-hour run time.
5338,0,"Billed as a musical reimagining of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, the film is about as cheerful an experience as having to deal with Amazon customer care on Christmas Eve because they lost your present in transit."
5339,0,"With too many different tones at play and no discernible audience that it wants to cater to directly, Spirited is like melted ice cream served at room temperature: you know there’s something good in there, but this isn’t it."
5340,1,Like being punched in the face with a candy cane; the sudden sugar rush of festive feels is sickly but irresistible. Spirited is a proper Christmas cracker and destined to become an annual rewatch.
5341,0,"As comfortable as Spirited is at mocking itself, it also ends up feeling embarrassed at the decision to make it a musical."
5342,1,"It’s a goofy and broad reworking of the themes from “A Christmas Carol,” and in spite of being overlong and obvious, it is still a funny, crowd-pleasing lark that leans heavily on the likability of its stars."
5343,0,"Like too many modern family-friendly blockbusters, Spirited takes a mystical, unexplained literary concept and turns it into a rules-filled bureaucracy."
5344,1,It probably won’t join many people’s holiday-watching traditions ... but it’s an okay Christmas diversion with some nice surprises.
5345,0,"Spirited tries turning A Christmas Carol on its head, and while it’s big and boisterous, the movie isn’t consistently irreverent enough to feel like much more than a streaming stocking stuffer."
5346,1,"Spirited never gets you to a place of soaraway joy, exactly, but it’s busy, silly and not a bad time."
5347,0,"...there’s something slightly too slick and charm-free about it, which director Sean Anders never quite overcomes..."
5348,1,"This reboot of the Charles Dickens classic is top tier entertainment for anyone who likes a good show tune. With Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds heading up a cast including Octavia Spencer, Spirited is pure wish fulfilment from start to finish."
5349,0,"A would-be Christmas perennial that will wilt pretty fast, thanks to its snarky adolescent tone, short-shelf-life pop culture references and prefabricated sentimentality."
5350,1,"It is an over-decorated Christmas tree that is often at the risk of toppling over, yet ultimately manages to stay upright thanks to some catchy musical sequences and a ‘go for broke’ enthusiasm that is more than fitting this time of year."
5351,1,"At a certain point, you just wish they'd get on with it already. But it delivers the Christmas movie goods."
5352,1,"Ferrell’s finely crafted goofiness contrasts with Reynolds’s sardonic character. They’re not exactly Hope and Crosby, but, as funny, all-singing-and-dancing combos go these days, they’ll do."
5353,1,It is fun and features some dandy song and dance song numbers.
5354,0,The dreaded blockbuster runtime is very much the ghost that haunts this one. There’s just no need for a jaunty Christmas movie to be this long -- it’s passive-aggressive.
5355,0,"There is no scene that someone thought could not be improved by intrusive, ostentatious purple-green-gold stage lights. That’s because the people behind ""Spirited"" would seem to rather skip the onscreen stuff altogether and go straight to the stage."
5356,1,"Filmmaker Sean Anders and actor Will Ferrell have come up with a fun new musical take on the Christmas chestnut, bringing a modern sensibility and a couple of clever twists to the tale that make it just fresh enough to be worth a look."
5357,1,"I don't know if the movie will become a perennial classic, but it's certainly a terrific way to spend two hours this, or any, Christmas season."
5358,1,"Even with a too-long run time, Spirited offers a fun family holiday offering that even includes a few references to the reason for the season."
5359,1,"Its characters and premise are as classic as they come, but the plot comes with quirky curveballs and overly elaborate dance sequences which are just as much a treat as they are an assault on the senses."
5360,1,"Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds team up for a hammy song-and-dance spectacular that's a clever rethink of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol."""
5361,1,"A lively premise, with some decent gags (and a few too many songs), Spirited is unlikely to trouble any 'Greatest Ever Christmas Movie' lists — but it brings plenty of seasonal good cheer."
5362,1,"Spirited offers a lot of fun little gags that work, along with a few misfires."
5363,1,"If you manage to get past the rocky start of Sean Anders' Spirited, then the rest of it is good enough for you to have a jolly good time."
5364,1,The cleverness of this Dickens inversion carries the film a long way while Ferrell & Reynolds have a nice chemistry and a few of the songs even click. Can't be too many Humbugs if I was ready to see another redemption in their dynamic when it was over.
5365,1,"""Spirited"" it too long, self-serious and tidy to feel that spontaneous and goofy. But it's novel and kind of cute...with Reynolds and Ferrell hoofing and singing like this is what they've wanted to do all their professional lives."
5366,1,"With big laughs and epic spectacle song-and-dance numbers, Spirited is a new holiday classic that gives a modern and surprising twist to A Christmas Carol. Ryan Reynolds, Will Ferrell, and Octavia Spencer have great chemistry."
5367,1,This bright and bubbly musical is just what you need to get into the Christmas spirit this season
5368,0,[Ferrell and Reynolds] drag their feet through a convoluted story without any holiday magic between the performances. There’s barely any chemistry to be found here.
5369,1,"Spirited is ripe with contemporary references and smart-alecky lines, perfect for the screen persona of Reynolds, who knows how to deliver them, and for the Elf -like sweetness and confusion of Ferrell who is in his comfort zone here."
5370,0,"Fans of Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Reynolds have likely never seen them in anything this earnest and tacky before, and are liable to feel somewhere between betrayed and stunned."
5371,0,"Bombastic musical numbers cause tonal whiplash in a script pulled in too many directions. Even archetypes need some character development, and Spirited fails to make its happy ending feel earned."
5372,0,... a lively yet predictable crowd-pleaser putting a fresh coat of glaze on a stale cinematic fruitcake.
5373,1,"When Spirited has so many of its ornate pieces in sync, it can be a joyous cinematic treat like very few others of past or present."
5374,1,It’s almost like a community theater production of an original musical—so very rough around the edges but also pretty easy to root for in the end.
5375,1,"What really makes Spirited sing isn’t the singing at all—it’s the script. In addition to an entertaining story, believable characters, and several fun twists that I won’t spoil here, Spirited comes with a surprisingly nuanced social commentary."
5376,1,"Spirited dares to make itself the plaything of critics with a song titled Unredeemable, but in the end, it does more than a little good."
5377,1,"This bros-meets-Scrooged affair, co-written by Sean Anders and John Morris, is funny and clever, blending the 19th century behaviors with 22nd century attitudes, and Ferrell and Reynolds are quick with the quips and the wisecracks"
5378,0,"While Anders delivers choreography and holiday sentiment, he’s not making a movie here, he’s chasing one."
5379,1,"A jolly, bouncy musical...showing skills in both sarcasm and sincerity, the two funnymen sing their way through a new adventure of the Ghost of Christmas Present."
5380,0,"“Spirited” was never going to be any good, but it would have been slightly better — and a change of pace — if Reynolds and Ferrell had switched roles."
5381,1,"Such an amusing, buoyant and good-natured entertainment that it’s not hard to forgive this flashy musical-comedy-fantasy’s missteps."
5382,1,"Though Spirited comes up short as a musical, it is still pretty enjoyable. Perhaps that’s because it is just so stuffed with everything else: If one part doesn’t totally work, there’s plenty else in the four-quadrant buffet to sample."
5383,0,"It looks expensive and attempts to do everything at once, but it’s more shine than substance — and about as funny as the market price of a new iPhone."
5384,1,[T]he film is a fun and funny riff on a familiar conceit.
5385,1,"While not without some issues, the movie lands as a modern-day fable whose colorfully packaged and exuberantly pitched life lessons carry an undeniable timeliness."
5386,1,"And while the story is bombastic, is still better than aliens. With that in mind, I'll give the film a B-, its not perfect, but if you settle in, you can enjoy one last adventure."
5387,1,"Despite the weirdly ambivalent headlines and mixed reviews dogging this film since its bow at Cannes, this is one of the most consistently enjoyable legacy sequels of recent years."
5388,1,It’s fun; it’s wacky; it works.
5389,0,"The final Indiana Jones entry is actually near the top of what is a usually dismal filmic phenomenon: closing chapters of long-running action vehicles. But what's missing is any sense of urgency in the story, or any sense of charisma from Ford himself."
5390,1,"has enough throwback charm, humor, and attention to character that it comes close to earning its spot in a franchise that frankly should have ended with Indy riding off into the sunset in Last Crusade"
5391,1,"Without Spielberg, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is just a professional and innocuously pop-corn movie: a compilation of ""greatest hits"" by an emblematic character of a type of cinema that is fading away. [Full review in Spanish]"
5392,1,"It may have squiffy CG, a perhaps too extended opening, and repetitious set pieces of evasion and capture, but Mangold sticks the emotional and thematic landing ..."
5393,1,"The acting throughout “Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny” is solid and the special effects are, as expected, state of the art. Composer John Williams is present for the musical thrills."
5394,1,"This a movie for the nostalgia-minded. Between the score and extensive de-aging of Harrison Ford from 79 years to 37, it’s as if we weren’t 42 years from Raiders of the Lost Ark and we can almost feel like we’re watching installments filmed back to back."
5395,1,Dial of Destiny manages to be the complete opposite — the rare legacy sequel content with simply saying goodbye. Telling a poignant story about our relationship with nostalgia and how attempts to cling to the past prevent us from living in the present.
5396,1,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is cluttered and visually problematic, but never hopeless."
5397,0,The terrible final act torpedoes any chance of this film being deemed worthy of the franchise.
5398,0,"The exaggerated plot that seems without rhyme or reason, prevents you from savoring it to the fullest. It may be the nostalgia of the well-thought-out movies of the saga, but ""The dial of destiny"" fails at that important point. {Full Review in Spanish}"
5399,0,Considering the gravitas of Ford’s performance — which channels such profound grief — the disconnectedness between his acting and the rest of the film only serves to underline how the movie fails in reconciling with death.
5400,1,Dial of Destiny delivers on all its promises from breathless action and the sweetest love story (Indy travels with Marion’s photograph) to a historical Macguffin with a touch of supernatural and finished with that rousing score from John Williams.
5401,1,"Not much has changed for Indiana Jones. Admittedly, the relic in question is more niche than the Ark or the Holy Grail — but otherwise, The Dial of Destiny is right in the mold of every other Indiana Jones installment, a swashbuckling adventure film."
5402,1,The latest offering is entertaining but there’s no real magic. It is a production that hits all the right nostalgic notes despite a script that stumbles between paying homage to past works and trying to bring some originality to the tale.
5403,0,The genuinely entertaining beginning (featuring younger Indy fighting Nazis) and heartfelt final sequence are excellent. It’s what falls between these bookends that grows tiresome.
5404,1,"Harrison Ford as the archeologist icon has a grizzled, grumpy sort of melancholy that refuses pity, self or other, for a failing body and life. It is the saving grace of a film that at times falls into a simulacrum of what the franchise should deliver."
5405,0,Proves that sometimes it is best not to unearth the relics of the past in the corrosive air of a creatively corrupt present.
5406,1,What works is Ford’s portrayal of disheartened man of conviction who has watched the world achieve its greatest triumphs and commit its worst atrocities.
5407,1,There’s little point in poring over the Indiana Jones stories as if they were manuscripts in need of decoding. The pleasure of these movies is the non-stop action.
5408,1,It had all of the things you want from a great Indiana Jones films.
5409,1,"Science and history are at the forefront of this epic tale, delivering a worthwhile quest for Mikkelsen and Ford to battle over for 2.5 hours of screen time."
5410,0,"Harrison Ford’s final Indiana Jones is a lackluster, emotional conclusion to the campy, adventure franchise that it might be better to skip the film and just go on the ride in Anaheim to relive the magic of the Indiana Jones films."
5411,1,"Longtime fans should find an adequate conclusion for this 70-year-old hero. And maybe given how ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" turned out, that in itself is the real accomplishment."
5412,0,"It almost feels wrong to see Indy in high-definition like this. Dial of Destiny lacks the warmth of film, the spirit of adventure, and the twinkle in Indy’s eye."
5413,0,The frustrating aspect of Dial of Destiny lies in how it scratches at the surface of its predecessors’ magic but never breaks through to the core.
5414,1,"James Mangold explores the history of one of the most beloved characters in cinema in such a beautiful way. This explores why Indy stays in the past & is enamored with history, as he’s reluctant of his future after losing his zeal."
5415,1,"Watching Ford flashing his crooked smile again, plus his bantering with Waller-Bridge, is almost enough to keep this new instalment whirring."
5416,1,"While the action scenes may not be as groundbreaking as before, and the thrill of treasure hunting may not be as strong, we see Indiana Jones from a fresh perspective – a man lost in time."
5417,1,"A good, escapist blockbuster. It's what you want."
5418,1,An affectionate and mostly appropriate return to all the things we love about Indiana Jones.
5419,1,"It was fun to see Indiana Jones one last time, but there are some problems in this film: too many repetitive chase scenes, some characters not well-drawn, and the third act is weird and wild and just doesn't quite work."
5420,1,This film looks and films like it could have been shot in the 1980s and should be enjoyed by those who fell in love with the original films.
5421,1,"Harrison Ford's still got it and will always have it. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is full of nostalgia, fun and adventure."
5422,1,"It’s a memorable, legacy-celebrating conclusion that effectively passes the torch."
5423,1,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is everything I wanted. Entertaining, Beautiful, fulfilling, Weird, & Emotional (I cried!) Mangold delivers an Classic Blockbuster that explores Regret, Time, & Our Legacies."
5424,1,The film gains momentum in the second half and then all hands on deck and away we go.
5425,1,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is not without flaws, but it’s also a journey worth taking: if you’re a fan of the franchise, you won’t be disappointed."
5426,1,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,"" ... is the trippiest and most rollicking combination of reminiscence and big-screen adventure you’ll see this summer."
5427,0,"You could fault the new cast members, an insufferable Waller-Bridge in particular. But no. The bulk of the blame falls squarely on James Mangold, the filmmaker who was brave, or foolhardy, enough to take the reins from Spielberg."
5428,1,"It’s different from the other films, but that’s to be expected for its age, and it offers a fun dose of adventure and Nazi punching."
5429,0,Sigh deeply and move on.
5430,0,There are only hints of the old good salad but lots of mediocre dressing on this plate.
5431,1,"Director James Mangold hits all the classic Indy beats -- globe-trotting, banter, double-crosses, zany artefacts."
5432,0,"Harrison Ford’s swan song as the titular character isn’t special, in fact it’s quite a tame escapade and in comparison to the other four (yes, the other FOUR), “Dial of Destiny” is a surprising bore."
5433,0,"Here’s the thing. With James Mangold at the helm, I expected more out of this fifth round with a character who hasn’t looked great since he prowled around the desert with his dad. Ford looks at ease, but the story does not."
5434,0,"With an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully The Dial of Destiny is the final Indy film. Like Roger Murtaugh in Lethal Weapon, Harrison Ford is literally too old for this sh*t."
5435,1,This Indiana Jones movie has what you know and love about the Indiana Jones franchise.
5436,0,"Poorly written, directed, and executed; a disappointment for everyone involved."
5437,1,"While the franchise might not be ending on a high note, that doesn't make the film entirely bad.  It's great to see Ford in the fedora again, and he carries more emotional weight in this film than ever before."
5438,1,"Fortunately, there is also a lot of action surrounding the overcomplicated, inconsistent story. The action, like the plot itself, is not believable, but it is entertaining, nonetheless, featuring daring stunts, good effects, and big scale battle scenes."
5439,1,"When Ford is a) given the right material and b) challenged by the right director/actors, you remember that he’s something more important than a film icon. He’s a damn good actor."
5440,0,"From Indy giving lectures in the present to its final act, the movie is a jumble of riddles worthy of an escape room. An escape room with your grandpa that lacks... the charisma of the original trilogy. [Full review in Spanish]"
5441,1,"Indiana Jones gets to punch Nazis again. Some movie joys are timeless — even if, unfortunately, they’re also timely."
5442,1,"You can tell Steven Spielberg didn’t direct “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.” It has all the adventure of the previous outings, but lacks the humor and sheen Spielberg lavished on his rough-and-tumble hero."
5443,1,"The original trilogy stands on its own and Crystal Skull was crushingly disappointing. Dial of Destiny is really good, though not great. Unlike Crystal Skull, it's a fitting coda for Indiana Jones that leaves you on the right note for the character."
5444,1,"As someone who felt the updated phrase for Jumping the Shark should have been LaBeoufing the Monkeys rather than Nuking the Fridge, I couldn’t help but wince at the late-inning turn of events in a movie without many low points ... or high points, either."
5445,1,a warmhearted sendoff for the globe-trotting archaeologist that puts star Harrison Ford—at eighty—back in the saddle for one more adventure.
5446,0,The movie is full of action but it is all over the top and the spaces in between seem to drag. Now the way you would want this franchise to end.
5447,1,Firmly in the top four Indiana Jones movies.
5448,1,"Harrison Ford is better than ever in his iconic role as Indiana Jones, it's entertaining, silly, and outrageous exactly what you should expect from this classic movie series."
5449,1,"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is faithful to the original story while retaining the zest of the action-adventure serials of the first half of the 20th century that inspired the modern masterpiece of inspired, breathless fun."
5450,1,"This is a good reminder of why we love going to see big popcorn movies, even when they're not perfect."
5451,1,"Watching the film—and considering it within the context of the four-decade-spanning franchise—I also wonder if a lasting legacy of Indiana Jones is as a chronicle of disenchantment and faith’s gradual erosion in a secular, technological age."
5452,1,"Dial poses the same question for its hero that it does for its audience: Does the world still need Indiana Jones? Fortunately for both, the answer is yes."
5453,1,"This last Indy plays its nostalgia perfectly, checking all the boxes and ending the series aptly. This is what summer viewing used to be and should be."
5454,1,"While it lacks the magic of the original trilogy, Harrison Ford’s emotional connection to Jones is evident, as he delivers a fantastic performance. This journey gets too silly at times, but there are plenty of moments that work."
5455,1,"We’re there to see Harrison Ford, with hat and whip, dazzle us with his action scenes and pure star power, and that is more valuable than an ancient treasure."
5456,1,"Since much of this new movie deliberately references the earlier installments, my wonderment remains dimmed. Still, retro-ness has its appeal, and Dial of Destiny is nothing if not thumpingly old-school."
5457,0,"What is Dial of Destiny if not an ill-fitting coda to a series that has, for some segment of the Raiders audience with each release, had most of its luster polished off?"
5458,1,"The Indiana Jones saga gives its iconic character a fifth adventure that moviegoers didn’t ask for, but that longtime fans should appreciate."
5459,1,"Here is Indy – still thriving, still globe-trotting, still getting into fist fights with rotten Nazis. Is that a bad thing? Absolutely not."
5460,1,"Despite its flaws, it deserves recognition for its commitment to delivering an adventure of a lifetime."
5461,0,"As the plot veers into the sci-fi realm that was nearly 100 percent responsible for the downfall of its predecessor, it becomes clear that time is certainly the villain, and even AI can't bring us back our old Doctah Jones."
5462,1,There’s not much here that’s overtly disappointing; it just never hits the giddy heights of the Spielberg films.
5463,0,The whole opening of the film... is just a constant stream of sour notes.
5464,0,"While the crack of Indy’s whip and the moment Ford dons his famous brown fedora may get those feel-good endorphins flowing, it also makes in painfully obvious that a movie can only coast so far on nostalgia."
5465,0,"Frustrating, underwhelming, and, ultimately, meaningless."
5466,1,"...allows Indy to nobly, creakily hang up his hat and whip, leaving the rest of us in an increasingly exhausted multiverse of capes and cowls."
5467,1,It's not the final movie the character of Indiana Jones deserves. The film works as a fun theme park ride.
5468,1,"The film’s biggest flaw is that it is too long and drawn out. At 154 minutes, Dial of Destiny outlasts Raiders by more than half an hour – and the audience is going to feel every second of it."
5469,1,Manages to entertainingly encompass every surface-level tenet of an Indiana Jones movie without finding the soul.
5470,1,"Even if it doesn´t live up to the original trilogy (how could it?), this film certainly presents itself as a much more worthy farewell to one of the most iconic characters that Cinema has created than the last one. [Full review in Portuguese]"
5471,1,"The conclusion of “Dial” is bittersweet, and if you were to say it’s a bit too neat, I wouldn’t argue. Yet, it’s the way it should end, and is not without its irony."
5472,1,"Mangold, who shares screenplay credit with three other writers, gets the emotional tenor right, delivering a consistently pleasurable and intermittently stirring farewell to one of cinema’s most durable heroes."
5473,1,It's a good send-off to the legend of Indiana Jones and will make you go back to the original trilogy again.
5474,1,... The experience of watching Dial of Destiny is best appreciated in relation to Indy: as a character study of a hero whose triumphs and flaws—and how they affect the people closest to him—are laid bare.
5475,1,Forgivable on all fronts... exaggerated and disproportionate but tremendously fun and full of heart and charisma. [Full review in Spanish]
5476,1,"Waller-Bridge steps into the Indy universe like someone born to its whisky-sour blend of the mercenary, the knowing and the wise-cracking."
5477,0,"While some might enjoy the nostalgia the movie taps into, but Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is too dull and long for me."
5478,1,"More than his returns as Han Solo or Rick Deckard, Dial of Destiny lets Ford go to work as a leading man."
5479,1,Dial of Destiny feels like revisiting a favorite place from a distant memory.
5480,0,"There was a moment in the 9th century when a bunch of Italians dug up a dead pope and put him on trial. That’s what Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny feels like, a cadaver being propped up and shouted at for two and a half hours."
5481,1,"Dial of Destiny is not perfect. In fact, it’s a rather flawed movie, and the flaws are extremely noticeable. But it is also very entertaining, exciting, well-acted, traditional at the right places and surprising in the best way."
5482,1,A worthy successor to Raiders of the Lost Ark.
5483,1,Ford’s charisma is firing on all cylinders. Indy may complain of “crumbling vertebrae” but the veteran actor more or less carries this $300m blockbuster on his own.
5484,0,"“Indian Jones and the Dial of Destiny”...pacing, the run time, and overall story prevents any potential rewatch, and it pains me to say this but maybe this gem of a franchise should be left alone or better yet, placed in a museum."
5485,1,"""Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" won't be the most memorable of the five films, and the runtime could be about 40 minutes shorter, however, it's got exciting action sequences,  classic Indiana Jones humor, and makes for a fun theatrical experience."
5486,1,Wright has constructed an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It’s unlike anything you’ve seen before.
5487,1,"Three movies are stacked into one… for those who can follow along and appreciate its quick draw, it is a generous offering.  [Full review in Spanish]"
5488,1,"11 years later, it remains the best video game movie ever and a top-shelf comic book movie, and one of Edgar Wright’s best movies."
5489,1,This is a flashy filmic landscape of expertly choreographed fight sequences and bubble-written onomatopoeia splattered across frames.
5490,1,"So much of the film is completely nonsensical, bringing new meaning to the notion of a live action video game movie."
5491,1,"Easily Summer 2010's wildest, most inventive and original comedy."
5492,1,Edgar Wright's love letter to geekdom is still wildly inventive and imaginative ten years on.
5493,1,Scott Pilgrim vs. the World stands out as a film adaptation that loves its source material's medium as much as it loves its stories.
5494,1,"Light as a feather, driven by a near-perfect soundtrack, this movie is still as fresh and innovative today as it was a decade ago."
5495,1,A fascinating example of different and relevant cinema. [Full review in Spanish].
5496,1,So many movies feel derivative or fall into easily recognizable categories. [Scott Pilgrim] is a movie that stands out from the crowd and continues to do so ten years later.
5497,1,The 112 minutes of 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' are a constant appeal to the public with impossible scenes in which reality and fantasy are mixed with an astonishing naturality. [Full Review in Spanish]
5498,1,It's just joyfully creative in the way Wright weaves the lexicons of video games and rock into the narrative but that shouldn't distract you from the fact this is also skilled genre filmmaking of a high order.
5499,1,"Perhaps if we were all able to view life more like those games that challenged us as children, we wouldn't be so afraid to leap after what we want."
5500,1,"Wright delights in setting up the tale with a mix of comedy, great production design and Fight Club style visual gags. On the downside, Cera's standard goofy geek stereotype has become slightly wearing."
5501,1,"A defiantly youthful, but nevertheless mature film that is not quite like anything you will have seen before."
5502,0,"Does it seem pandering? Are they sick of the bleating, narrow-shouldered Michael Cera type-casting? Do they dislike having their sense of leading epic lives pointed out for laughs, especially in the grandiose form that is cinema?"
5503,1,"A giddy, hyperkinetic, over-stylized barrage of video game, comic book and pop culture references in all the best ways."
5504,0,Energy and invention and audacity count for little unless you can sense something at its core - unless a film gives you something to feel - but there is zilch here. It's hollow.
5505,1,"In adapting the visual style [from the graphic novel], Wright smartly finds a way both to enhance it, while remaining true to the source material."
5506,1,... an extremely intelligent film with several narrative surprises and truly hilarious moments. [Full review in Spanish]
5507,1,"Scott Pilgrim is not what you expect. It's not what the marketing made you expect. It's better than that. Funnier, sweeter, with eye-popping visuals and characters who feel so flawed and real they could be your own brother, sister, or friend."
5508,1,"Before the August arrival of Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, the last youth comedy with any resonance was The House Bunny (2008)..."
5509,1,A one-dimensional but amusing sugar rush of a movie.
5510,1,Scott Pilgrim VS The World is a great action comedy with an interesting look at romance and teen culture; the humorous tone of the film masks a much darker look at romance.
5511,1,"Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World adaptation cut its Adderall with pixie-stix...to gleeful, great success."
5512,1,"Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is refreshing, unique, wildly entertaining and consistently funny. I haven't had this much fun while watching a movie in a long, long time."
5513,1,"While there have been numerous attempts by Hollywood to cash in on the popularity of video games, none of those films has felt true to the artistic and creative spirit of those games until now. This one gets it right."
5514,1,The cast of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World represents the best young talent coming up in Hollywood today.
5515,1,"Full of fresh, sharp touches and nonchalantly brash performances, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World consistently hits the sweet spot."
5516,1,"It's fresh, funny, inventive and unique."
5517,0,"Like the special effects, the characters are sketched out in tiresome cinematic shorthand, as if to reassure the viewer that this joyride really isn't worth thinking too hard about."
5518,1,"An unrelenting torrent of affectionate but biting music-scene satire, old-school Nintendo references, and cartoony depictions of post-adolescent love, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a delight."
5519,1,"Frankly, us geeks have never had it so good: Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is modern cinema at its most exciting, and it belongs to us."
5520,1,"Edgar Wright and his crew had a daunting task in adapting this great material, but they were able to mix it together just right for the big screen, and have ultimately made one of the best films of the year."
5521,1,"The entire film works on just how much you are willing to accept its premise: if you're fine with people developing amazing powers, characters talking directly to the camera and almost every other trick in the cinematic book, then you'll do fine"
5522,1,A film that defines the video game generation and redefines the romantic comedy.
5523,1,"Scott Pilgrim will make your head explode. But in a good way, not with brains and stuff."
5524,1,"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World becomes a fatal case of flash over substance. Pretty great flash, though."
5525,1,"While O'Malley's storyline and dialogue are nearly intact for the film adaptation, Wright's vision turns it into a riotous spoof of the films that made Cera a star."
5526,1,"Scott Pilgrim is a film where youth is power and power is music, video games, and confronting your exes with how great your current hook up is, but like most hipsters you meet, it is more impressed with itself than anything else"
5527,1,Proving that the geek shall inherit the earth ... cinema's über-nerd Michael Cera [takes] on all comers in the quest for the girl of his dreams.
5528,1,"An almost overwhelming barrage of quirks, the adventures of Scott Pilgrim come at you at a million miles a minute but you won't mind because it's so damn entertaining."
5529,0,Essentially amounts to a case of what could have been.
5530,1,"Scott Pilgrim is refreshing in its lack of pretension and lack of smirking hipster irony. Instead we get something sweet, genuine, and dazzlingly well made."
5531,1,"Visually daring, ingenuous and extremely entertaining, Scott Pilgrim is virtually flawless."
5532,1,An interesting statement on modern youths detachment from actual human emotions through the advent of technology...
5533,1,Not only one of the funniest movies of the summer; its utilization of over-the-top special effects unintentionally puts it up there in the action-blockbuster category it so archly parodies.
5534,1,"[It's] the funniest, most furiously action packed film of the year; one certain to be beloved by all the boys and girls who share the same passions and foibles as its foolish hero (myself included)."
5535,1,Video games taught a generation to fight for what you want
5536,1,"Some might see it as a great hipster parable, a postmodern epic for the Nintendo generation; I think it's simply a triumph of dizzying cinematic style, and it never misses a beat."
5537,0,"When your hero can just hit the reset button, it's awfully hard to worry about him."
5538,0,"Maybe with a different lead actor and about 20 minutes of running time chopped from it, I might have enjoyed it more. Instead I laughed through parts, but was never emotionally drawn into any of it."
5539,0,"Fitfully entertaining and sometimes brilliantly silly — just not really engaging, and occasionally objectionable."
5540,1,"I can only say that where some see shallowness, I saw a witty interplay of surfaces and style."
5541,1,"This movie is like the entirety of American youth culture crammed into a single package: It's about love, alienation, video games, comic books, chord-grinding indie/punk rock, texting, dead-end jobs and evil ex-boyfriends."
5542,1,"This one's geek heaven, a mash-up of comic books, computer games, grunge rock and slacker drama, all a little quicker and droller than anything of the kind before."
5543,1,"One of the more audacious and creatively conceived movies of the year though, at 32, I felt a bit too old for it."
5544,0,A film you either love or hate. I didn't love it.
5545,1,"Some of us always knew playing video games was cool. Now, thanks to Scott Pilgrim, everyone else does too."
5546,0,"The bombardment lasts for almost two hours and by the end of the film, we feel almost as exhausted as the characters."
5547,1,"It's the old romcom story - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy fights to win back girl. But it's steeped in pop culture, especially video games, rock and comic strips."
5548,1,"It understands perfectly the lunacy of being of love -- how, at the same time, it clarifies and deludes, ennobles and fells us."
5549,1,"If ever a film was guaranteed not to disappoint its target audience, it was surely Scott Pilgrim Vs The World."
5550,1,"It could have been a noisy, flashy mess, but luckily it's got heart, which makes it feel fun and unique, and more like a lo-fi, endearing mess instead."
5551,1,"An original, funny and clever film that's an assault on the senses."
5552,1,"Precisely drawn hipster farce whose rich characters all have inner lives, motivations and tortuous backstories"
5553,1,A consistently entertaining parody of contemporary cultural foibles that are apparently too marginal to be satirized in comedies that actually make money.
5554,0,Scott Pilgrim tries so hard to be loved that it ends up very trying indeed.
5555,0,"It's a string of scenes, it's a blur of faces, it's a heaving great two-hour maelstrom of noise and punching. But it's not a proper movie."
5556,1,"An instant zeitgeist classic and proud bearer of yet another Wright-icised genre, as undoubtedly the best King-Kong-Bob-Omb-Rom-Com you're ever likely to see."
5557,1,"Hugely enjoyable, frequently funny action-pic-slash-romcom that perfectly recreates the manga meets video games vibe of the comics..."
5558,1,"It's heartfelt, hilarious and a highly satisfying adaptation of the book. You don't have to be a geek to adore it; you just have to remember being young."
5559,1,"Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is endearingly relatable precisely because it celebrates the ordinary, focusing far more on the foibles and frailties of the players than on the invincible avatars of a game."
5560,1,"Tarantino, without the extraneous dialogue."
5561,1,"The level-up, super fun, dance-dance, pop culture, max-combo, rock-n-roll romance video game film of, well, forever."
5562,1,"Nerd Nirvana! Think Napoleon Dynamite on Red Bull. Inventive, quirky, and occasionally very funny."
5563,1,"In a cinematic battlefield full of Inceptions and Expendables, Scott Pilgrim vs The World takes on all comers and kicks ass. One of the best films of the year so far."
5564,1,Scott Pilgrim plays its own tune.
5565,0,"Also versus coherence, versus maturation, versus real emotion..."
5566,1,"An energetic ode to youthful preoccupations, as well as a fun 21st century romance."
5567,0,"Sure, it's visually whizzy and often very funny, but filmmaker Wright loses the story in the scuffle."
5568,1,leaves no mediated stone unturned and tosses anything and everything into its conceptual blender with an infectious wild abandon
5569,0,Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a film full of sound and fury signifying WTF. It's slick shtik.
5570,1,What it does have is a very smart script and a tremendous amount of visual flair.
5571,0,"For those out of the loop, or too far removed from these characters' headspace, the inventiveness of the film's execution alone is not enough."
5572,1,"For all its videogame references, this -- like Wright's previous films -- is at heart a genre satire, reinventing the John Hughes 1980s teen dramedy for the plugged-in, post-postmodern mashup generation."
5573,1,Who can resist a story that self-checks its hipsterism?
5574,1,"Slick, smart and audacious, it's a film that anyone in their twenties who owns a Nintendo will be queuing around the block to see."
5575,1,"What if life were like a video game? In 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,' it is. And things are a lot more realistic, heart-wise, anyway, than you might expect."
5576,1,"It's frothy and fun and, primarily, aimed at a teen or twentysomething audience who will identify with its world of lousy apartments and omnipresent roommates, gaming arcades, Goodwill stores, coffee shops and battles of the bands."
5577,1,Scott Pilgrim vs the World could well become a cultural touchstone for the Tetris generation.
5578,1,"The real star of the show is Wright, who makes an effortless transition from ambitious Brit genre helmer to blockbuster auteur."
5579,1,"It's loud and brash, but strangely endearing."
5580,1,"Adapted from Brian O'Malley's comic-book saga with breakneck stylistic verve by Edgar Wright, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is the ultimate geek wish-fulfilment flick."
5581,1,Young adults of today are a different breed. Now they finally have a movie that serves as a giant metaphor for their experiences.
5582,0,"She has too many exes. They should have stopped at four, because it just means these repetitive fights that are the same and they're all unbelievable and it becomes extremely tedious."
5583,1,"The film is -- perhaps surprisingly -- enjoyable, even for those of us who are a little more mature."
5584,1,The first motion picture to successfully translate video game logic to cinema.
5585,1,Edgar Wright Experiments with Video Game as Artistic Flourish and Succeeds Despite the Weakness in Structure and Cast.
5586,1,Never have I walked out so pleased with a movie that also had me absolutely disgusted. A true horror gem.
5587,1,A throwback to old school Video Nasties & B Rated horror movies. Ortega and Goth steal the show…. I left intrigued with what the prequel/sequel will be but A24 has another hit for indie films & I can’t stop thinking about the film
5588,0,X felt like it was meandering without a purpose. And maybe that was the point–to enjoy the ride without being bogged down by a hefty plot. Those going to the theatre to see the nudity and gore of the horror movies of yesteryear will leave satisfied.
5589,1,"Separately, X and Pearl might not have made my 10 Best of 2022 list; together, how could they not?"
5590,1,A gruesome slasher reminiscent of classic horror.
5591,1,"Ends with a wholly satisfying finale and avoids the pitfalls of frustrating the audience, as so many independent horror films seem to do. It’s a slower burn for sure, but what a bloody, gory, rewarding ride."
5592,1,"I can give X the benefit of the doubt [with hindsight], accepting it as an entrypoint into a much larger world regardless of how incomplete it ultimately feels on its own."
5593,1,"X was true to its name, explicit sexual scenes, horrify scenarios & every more on the stories backdrop. But as a horror film Ti West nails it with his touch on horror story telling and worst case scenario perspective for every character it’s a insane ride"
5594,1,"It's crass and ghastly, with an on-the-nose premise fit for the often- sensationalist slasher genre and the salacious X-rated cinema embedded in this story."
5595,1,The film itself goes beyond being merely a ‘blood and guts killer time’ with an array of porn star characters. It feeds into your adrenaline and spikes it up to ten.
5596,1,If you're looking for a slow burn horror flick with plenty of atmosphere and faux-grindhouse aesthetics then X gon' give it to you!
5597,1,"The characters are fleshed-out and kooky — you’ll mourn when they meet their inevitable slaughter. And for a slasher, the acting is remarkably good: Jenna Ortega and Mia Goth in particular are scene-stealers."
5598,1,"X reanimates perennial fears of aging, older women, and one’s fading relevance."
5599,1,"X is a daring slasher, filled with unexpected twists that leave viewers stewing in uncomfortable moments and horrifying realizations."
5600,1,X is a bold horror film that might just be the best dirty movie you’ve seen all year.
5601,1,"If you go into this with your eyes open, it delivers a well-crafted slasher horror on all counts, even if its finale and body-count are hardly a surprise."
5602,1,"Ti West skillfully blends style with substance in A24’s X, delivering a riff on The Texas Chain Saw Massacre with a few subversive – and sexy – twists."
5603,0,"Whatever West is trying here doesn’t ultimately land, maybe because West himself doesn’t seem to care about any of these people."
5604,1,"Raw, emotional, upsetting, and unafraid to take its audiences to grotesque places, X is one of the very best films of the year."
5605,1,"X manages to tap into the nostalgic style of 70's horror while being a breath of fresh air for the genre. Ti West shows through his masterful directing, while winking at the audience, that you can put a ton of artistic flair into a ""dirty movie."""
5606,0,Ti West’s “X” is an unashamed ode to slasher movies that manages to capture what makes the good ones good while still being hampered by what makes the bad ones bad.
5607,0,"It pays homage to the adult film industry of the 70s, but I'm afraid it loses its guts by going through the easy and boring paths of conventional exploitation slasher. [Full review in Spanish]"
5608,1,Now this is the modern-day answer to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre we’ve been waiting for!
5609,1,"There's lashings of sex and gore, plus a few surprises along the way."
5610,1,"Smart, savvy and spectacularly staged while straddling and embracing that fine line between pleasure and pain."
5611,1,"Pure fun, X intelligently exploits the genre's codes without transgressing and incorporating small doses of humor for the seasoned viewer. [Full review in Spanish]"
5612,1,"An exquisite filmic anachronism that, disguised as the usual slasher, develops a discourse that gets under the skin and that, ultimately, elevates it as one of the greatest and riskiest titles of 2022."
5613,1,"The impressive direction and delightful performances, anchored by a terrific central turn from Goth, make this an enthralling horror entry that can satisfy the hunger for exciting spectacle and more sophisticated storytelling."
5614,1,"West's best film to date: a gooey, ebullient orgy of the lewd and the learned, the squalid and the sumptuous."
5615,1,"There’s nothing original about West’s highly stylized film, it’s just a down and dirty horror jam with a decent batch of jump-scares."
5616,1,"... A film tribute to 70's B-movies, particularly Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deep Throat."
5617,0,There's more sincerity in a good porn film... [Full review in Spanish]
5618,0,"X, first hour of the film is an homage to 70s psycho-sexual-film making and the last 45 minutes is a psycho-biddy/slasher. It's interesting to say the least but at no point was this a scary film."
5619,1,"A real delight, a genius within the genre that while paying homage to the classics, applies a rolling pin to expand the plot towards the unexpected. [Full review in Spanish]"
5620,0,"While certainly creepy and provocative at times, X stumbles from the pretentious pedestal this “elevated” horror film has propped itself upon."
5621,1,It's Mia Goth's show. The English-Brazilian actress is building a fine repertoire in the horror genre as someone who likes to dive into the deep end of psychotic-tinged stories with a human element coercing through it.
5622,1,"Overall, X is an entertaining and vivid throwback horror, with a mesmerizing performance from Goth, even if it doesn't slash quite as deep as it intends."
5623,1,"A lubricated and bloody nightmare where desire, pain, coitus, and murder are inseparable parts of the same basic act, animal and profoundly human. [Full review in Spanish]"
5624,1,... a slightly unfocused twist on the sex-and-death genre.
5625,1,Equally entertains and frightens… a genuine cinephile's feast. [Full review in Spanish]
5626,1,A quality horror film.  [Full review in Spanish]
5627,0,"Aside from its throwback grindhouse visual aesthetic, the film provides only hit-or-miss laughs and thrills, relying on stock characters and gratuitous gore rather than refreshing the formula."
5628,1,"West's return to horror is beautifully shot and features several stand-out female performances. The relationship between porn and horror isn't as novel as critics made it out to be, but the innovative ""stutter cuts"" alone make X worth checking out"
5629,1,Think of this as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Deep Throat. Ti West makes it perfectly clear that hes paying homage to these iconic films as he fills the movie with the meta commentary and tropes of this era in filmmaking.
5630,1,"Endorsing the patterns of several classics but endowing them with unbridled new audacity, this shocker also provides substantial gore."
5631,1,"Sometimes in life, you just want a simple slasher movie that checks the boxes and then some, X is that movie. Mixing great tension, kills, brutality, and solid characters, X delivers one of the better horror movies of recent years."
5632,1,"Ty West directs a horror that moves beyond simple slaughter. He expands into a broader discussion of religion, sexuality, and gender, thereby making X a slasher joyride with something more to say."
5633,1,"Making an artful horror movie is like making an avant-garde porno film: Whatever creative touches you want to include in it, ultimately the filmmaker has to show the people what they came to see."
5634,1,"There's tension, proper fleshiness that makes the audience wince, and the actors seem to be really enjoying themselves. Entertaining and repugnant, in a good way."
5635,1,Still gives me shivers
5636,1,It was entertaining. It stuck with me. i didn't know what to expect... I feel like this was a new angle for a slasher flick.
5637,1,"X is a gory, funny, surprisingly restrained and yet still gleefully amoral film."
5638,1,Ti West blends old school homage with modern horror thrills to craft a blackly comic and surprisingly poignant tale loaded with scares and gut-churning gore.
5639,1,"Its got a decent script, an energetic cast, and lots of style."
5640,1,"It's a love letter to the best of horror, and further, freedom of expression. There are moments of surprising, haunting beauty that add nothing to the plot, but everything to the experience. With X, West can be compared to Craven or even Carpenter."
5641,1,"A near-perfect film, cut off at the knees to make room for future sequels, but sequels that will surely flesh out the story."
5642,1,"A film that unabashedly combines fairly explicit sex scenes with an ultra gory slasher, and explores the relationship between sex and death."
5643,1,Ti West’s X aims its slasher-movie homage straight at classic horror fanatics.
5644,1,A meticulously-crafted ode to vintage horror.
5645,1,"This is really great, a throwback to those grindhouse films of the 1970s."
5646,1,"Falls off a bit once the killing starts, but Ti West has crafted an entertaining, humorous and sex-positive homage to '70s horror films that is just downright fun."
5647,1,"If you can get on its same wavelength — which admittedly takes the first ten or fifteen minutes — and understand what West is doing, then you’ll have a good time."
5648,1,"Whether you buy the premise or not, this is still one of the best horror films thats been made in a long time. The photography, editing and overall vibe harken to nostalgia movies like Boogie Nights and Dazed and Confused."
5649,1,Ti West is becoming one of the only directors since John Landis that’s capable of crafting a true horror comedy.
5650,1,"Proudly brings us right into the heart of horror cinema at its most sordid... without sacrificing any of the intellectual density that ""elevated horror"" is so proud of."
5651,1,A nasty-minded slasher with a wicked sense of humour and a taste for blood
5652,1,...an exceedingly (and sometimes excessively) deliberate horror film that benefits from its atmospheric sensibilities and roster of top-notch performances...
5653,1,This is a compendium of horror films from the 70s and early 80s all rolled into one.
5654,1,"Whether you want to breathe along with it remains an open question. Know this, though, X may not transcend its horror  niche but it embraces it with unwavering commitment."
5655,1,"Xs gory violence matched with sexual imagery makes for a uniquely entertaining slasher, albeit one that you may not be in a rush to watch again due to how uncomfortable it is."
5656,1,It’s an out-and-out slasher that embraces cliche as often as it desires to subvert it.
5657,1,"Goth, Ortega, and Snow all give endearing, dynamic performances."
5658,1,"X is preoccupied with voyeurism across different generations, bringing together two genres - horror and porn - associated not just with the MPAAs X rating, but also with the male gaze. That gaze will be subverted and skewered..."
5659,1,"West’s trademark slow build-up gives us every chance to imagine our own version of the mayhem on the way... To hold our attention in the meantime, he has another trick up his sleeve: making his characters sufficiently interesting and likeable."
5660,1,"A fantastic slasher flick that works on multiple levels, but chiefly at its most important job: slicing and dicing in dizzying delight."
5661,1,"West's film is meta but not in the painful wink-wink, nudge-nudge jokiness of the Scream franchise. Instead, it's a more subtle way of referencing the horror genre through just the visual look of the location or the costumes or the framing."
5662,1,"A skillful, clever, not entirely satisfying homage to the heyday of both skin flicks and slasher cinema."
5663,1,"X is a horrifying and self-aware slasher that knows no film exists in a bubble. It embraces cinematic history, humps it, then slashes its throat."
5664,1,"The film proves once again if you do a good job mixing sex and violence, you captured Hollywood's winning formula combo"
5665,1,"Creepy, hilarious, gross...X is a love letter to 70s horror classics but also something entirely fresh and original."
5666,1,"The characters (and the performances) are strong enough to make sure this avoids the usual pitfalls that come with making a film about film-making, giving the slaughter just enough of an emotional core to keep it from being a collection of flashy slashes"
5667,0,West just wants to punish everyone involved in gory ways played for laughs.
5668,1,X paints the screen with a sensual bloodbath that serves up plenty of well-timed thrills with a harrowing message.
5669,1,"I expected many things from X, but I didn't expect it to make me cry."
5670,1,"West effectively rachets up the tension by delaying the requisite bloodletting, which is done with a relative sense of restraint."
5671,1,"West has made a rare horror tale that makes you listen, ponder and consider whats happening to its hapless victims, and why."
5672,1,It's quite a while before the dictates of the genre kick in - and when they do it's with substantial force.
5673,1,I had fun with this and easily could see myself watching it again
5674,1,Director Ti West crafts a blood-soaked tribute to 1970's era slashers while inserting his own thoughtful meditations.
5675,1,"X has no interest in making any sweeping statement about gender, sexuality, or age. Instead, it strips slasher horror down to its core and reminds us of what it was about the genre that made us love it. It's funny, self-aware, and unashamedly gory."
5676,1,An instant slasher classic.
5677,1,"A no holds barred, take no prisoners horror flick that possesses that magical ability to still genuinely (and delightfully) shock and astound you."
5678,1,"For all its lackadaisical, uncontemporary pace, and lack of most great horror’s gruelling intensity, X remains a satisfying, keenly thoughtful ride."
5679,1,"It's porny, and it's scary."
5680,1,"Between West’s screenplay and a universally strong cast, X is surprisingly affecting."
5681,1,"Ti West's ""X"" is one of the best slashers I've seen this year. It's not for the faint of heart. Its story shocks but also broadens the horizons and provokes. Worth revisiting, with a soundtrack jam-packed with bangers and performances out of this world."
5682,1,X provides a map for how to do the classics right while still taking the formula somewhere original.
5683,1,"X is a whole-hearted homage to the 70s slasher movement. And unlike the majority of its kind, it actually manages to live up to its predecessors."
5684,1,"X by name, extreme by nature. Ti West's horror comeback doesn't pull any punches and it's full of sex, violence and plenty of great scares."
5685,1,"""Skewers the soured tropes and sex stereotypes of a certain slasher era..."""
5686,1,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a homage to the most relevant Nintendo saga... [Full review in Spanish]
5687,1,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a DREAM COME TRUE for lifelong Nintendo fans and PERFECT DOWN TO THE LAST PIXEL. With gorgeous animation and unforgettable music, Nintendo and Illumination have made a delightful family film filled with heart."
5688,1,"Its action, color, and silliness will appeal to kids while adult fans of the franchise will enjoy all the nostalgic connotations. It manages to tell a coherent, albeit forgettable, story with ample charm, thrills, and humor."
5689,1,Simple but effective for anyone who grew up with Mario in their lives.
5690,0,"It is obvious that in an effort to appeal to a wide demographic, the movie fails on all counts because of a weak script, an over dependence on elements lifted directly from the video game and several voice casting mistakes."
5691,1,"Packed with fantastic references that will warm the hearts of those who lived and still live with Nintendo and Mario up close. Along with energetic action, dazzling animation and world-building, and iconic music."
5692,1,"If folks grew up playing the games (or still do), and already treasure everything Mario, this is a must-see movie. For everyone else, the mileage in their kart will vary."
5693,1,PHENOMENAL ANIMATION!  Short & Simple (too short if I’m honest) Chris Pratt is honestly PERFECT as MARIO (yes I’m as shocked as you) Jack Black might steal the show as BOWSER. But Brian Tyler’s SCORE is so GOOD
5694,0,A rather forgettable affair.
5695,1,"This fun, visually gorgeous adaptation does the world's most famous plumber justice."
5696,1,"The voice cast did a good job and the movie has some colorful, eye-popping visuals but overall it's pretty forgettable."
5697,1,"This second big-screen adaptation of the popular video game series (after the ill-fated 1993 film) is vibrantly colored, speedily-paced (and not too long), and pleasantly diverting, if rather unremarkable in the long run."
5698,0,Harmless and charmless.
5699,0,"Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie feels aimed squarely at kids and fans driven by nostalgia and fan service. Too desperate to pack in game references, too frenetic and too amped up; the film operates at a 10 the whole time. Not bad, just not for me"
5700,0,"If you are a parent or guardian dragged to see The Super Mario Bros. Movie, be like Lumalee and abandon yourself to a nightmarish experience."
5701,0,Sometimes I get the feeling that the adventure of Mario and Luigi never goes beyond the routine level. [Full review in Spanish]
5702,0,"A harmless, generic blur of kid’s 'content'."
5703,1,"Harmless; it amounts to a Burger King kid’s meal and night of Nintendo 64. I’m not sure Illumination will ever take one single risk, but I do think their cheery, color-splosion style for 7-year-olds works for a movie about Super Mario Bros."
5704,1,Allow me to push past the Mario Movie’s obvious crowd-pleasing nature and cheery escapism for some typical film-critic pedantry: This thing feels like it was written by a calculator.
5705,1,"I think it did a good job of appealing to both older and younger fans of the ""Mario"" video game franchise. It hit all of the points and gave you all the IP that a viewer could have wanted. That's why it's such a huge hit."
5706,0,I didn't have high expectations but do feel like it could have gone a bit deeper beyond eye candy and easter eggs. However it is enjoyable as a kids movie meant to hit all expected Illumination tropes.
5707,1,"Our heroes have to make alliances, gather an army, defeat the Boss. Powerups, jumping, running, battling Kongs, Penguins, Koopa Troopas, and Shy Guys. If it was an NPC (non-playable character), you’re probably going to see it. That’s it, that’s the movie."
5708,1,"The movie accomplishes the main goal of being entertaining for the whole family.  Not 'super,' but definetfly 'It's a go!' [Full Review in Spanish]"
5709,0,"""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" unfortunately borrowed Guy Ritchie’s playbook from his disaster of a movie “Aladdin,” yep, there’s torture in ” Mario Bros,” just as in “Aladdin,”teaches kids to bully to get their way...nope, not on my watch."
5710,1,"Thankfully improving on the atrocious live action flick, the animated adventure film is a nice 90-minute diversion. The adults who once were kids and loved this game will get a kick out of this much-better game adaptation. Their kids will love it."
5711,1,"Older fans might be disappointed in the surface-level storytelling, but it’s hard not to smile at the affection shown for the games’ legacy."
5712,1,"Viewers expecting a Pixar-level film were asking too much of the folks who brought you such classics as ""Banana"" and ""Minion in a thong."" It's fun, visually impressive, and, most of all, harmless."
5713,0,... The quality of the offering is questionable from multiple angles.
5714,0,"A sort of dream come true for the fans of the mustached plumber, full of easter-eggs, details and devotion, but weighed down by a narrative foundation that's fragile enough to bury its commendable efforts to entertain."
5715,1,"With its message to siblings everywhere of nothing can hurt us as long as we're together,  The Super Mario Brothers movie is endearing, great fun for families to ingest and enjoy as one."
5716,1,"Mario delivers on looks and nostalgia, and whilst there is enough for adults and kids to enjoy here, a deeper story seems to have been kept in another castle."
5717,1,I'm not sure what high-art some of these critics are looking for but The Super Mario Bros. movie works for both fans of the long-lasting game franchise and people who want an entertaining escape. This is the best video game movie yet!
5718,1,"This lively computer-animated take on the video game just opened and it’s already the biggest box-office smash of 2023. Despite lapses into dull and disposable, it’s also a godsend for parents seeking family entertainment for the 5-year-old in all of us."
5719,1,"Adults with fond memories of dodging turtle shells in the ’80s and ’90s won’t mind watching the movie with their children, many of whom have dodged turtle shells in updated versions of those classic games."
5720,0,Memo to directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic: seeing corporate symbols go through the motions of a half-baked story isn't much fun.
5721,1,"Encapsulates charming classic video game characters within a fun, yet generic, plot that has a cult-classic worthy song stuffed in the middle and doesn’t overstay its welcome."
5722,1,"It's very entertaining for children and Nintendo fans, but the story is as deep as a Super Mario puddle and the throwaway references too sparse to even matter."
5723,1,"Packed full of nostalgic Mario references for all ages, and it's just fun to see these colorful worlds on the big screen."
5724,1,"Fun and entertaining.  The film will appeal most to fans of the video games and young kids. The animation is so true to the Nintendo franchise that you may feel lost without a controller,"
5725,0,The Super Mario Bros. Movie has a few worthwhile moments but it wasn’t enough to overcome the sheer banality of its storyline
5726,1,"The script may be thin, but getting to spend 90 minutes in this world of Mario certainly put a smile on my face and made me feel like a kid again."
5727,1,"You don’t have to blow the dust out of this cartridge; Mario is ready to jump, high kick and spin back into action. Let’s-a-go!"
5728,1,"Scripted by Matthew Fogel and directed by Andrew Horvath & Michael Jelenic, this hectic, fun-filled origin story has redeemed the Nintendo franchise's reputation after its catastrophic 1993 live-action movie adaptation."
5729,0,"If you’re a kid who spends half your time on a Nintendo Switch and the other half watching cartoons, there is plenty in Super Mario Bros to satisfy. If you’re the parent of such a kid, who are you to tell them what they should and shouldn’t be enjoying?"
5730,1,Okay for the adults and a pure delight for the kids.
5731,0,"Among the many errors of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, screenwriter Matthew Fogel plops him and his brother Luigi into a milquetoast Brooklyn family that doubts them and disrespects their small-business dreams."
5732,1,I've been wanting a Super Mario Brothers movie like this for a long time... I was smiling the entire time I was watching this movie.
5733,1,"Is this the greatest movie that is worth all those years of hype and anticipation? Honestly, no. Is it still a fun adventure to see the beloved games adapted to the big screen? Oh, absolutely!"
5734,0,"Crisp animation, mostly strong voice acting and fun for the entire family. No doubt Mario is a juggernaut franchise for Illumination and Universal. But overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is nothing groundbreaking and can be very generic thematically."
5735,1,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a very enjoyable and fun film.
5736,1,"This is a movie for adults, children, teens, and anyone that ever rocked with them Mario Bros."
5737,1,"Older moviegoers will likely be turned off by the simplicity of it all, but for fans who are young or young at heart, it’s an entertaining trip down the warp pipe."
5738,0,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the Illumination style done at its absolute worst.
5739,1,"While Mario has never been about its story, that doesn’t translate well to film. It misses the opportunity to expand upon its lore and characters in new ways. If it doesn’t take a Super Mushroom for next time, this franchise won’t stay fun for long."
5740,1,Captures the fun and whimsy that Nintendo is known for.
5741,0,"It is the laziest possible version of a Mario movie, and for most viewers, young and old, that’ll be totally acceptable."
5742,1,"But for viewers who are less familiar, sitting through The Super Mario Bros. Movie may feel like watching a second grader play a Mario game: It's cute, but you can't help thinking about all the other things you could be doing with your time."
5743,1,"Safe and predictable, but not necessarily in a bad way."
5744,1,The sneaky surprise here is Jack Black playing Bowser... he's hilarious.
5745,0,The missing ingredient for those adult audiences is any kind of wit or clever dialogue in the film's screenplay...
5746,1,"Fast-paced and entertaining, if also lacking any real emotional substance, it works best as an homage to the games."
5747,1,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a little too afraid to stray from the brothers' origins for its own good but delivers an entertaining adventure all the same.
5748,0,"An impressive Hollywood A-list voice cast and a script filled with nods to the video game series adds to the appeal, although by about the hour mark, you might well feel this is just one long chase movie."
5749,1,Watching this movie transported me back to the turn of the millennium when I first entered the colorful Mushroom Kingdom myself on my Game Boys.
5750,0,"It is, when all is said and done, intensely mediocre: prettier than a lot of animated mediocrity, but ""pretty"" only takes us so far."
5751,1,"I went to see this with my boyfriend's 9-year-old brother,  and watching the pure joy on his face made me fall in love with this film."
5752,1,"Adults might wish there were a few sharper jokes, but at least there’s a nice deliberate silliness in the way the film delivers the required scenes without fussing over explanations."
5753,1,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is designed to be looked at, with goofball humor that kids will like."
5754,1,A simple fun story. I was a fan!
5755,0,The whole package is a deranged mishmash of overstimulating elements.
5756,1,"Fans of The Mario Bros can take to the streets and cheer, as justice gets done to the characters they covet."
5757,1,"The Super Mario Brothers Movie is a sweet, funny, action packed and beautifully animated film with a touching underdog story, some fantastic world building that honors the game, and great VO work from this cast, especially Chris Pratt and Jack Black."
5758,0,"It’s fan service above all else, regressively so. Structuring a threadbare story around iconography linked to source material just isn’t enough."
5759,1,"Super Mario Bros. has been one of the most popular video games for nearly 40 years, and watching this joyous, colorful concoction it's easy to see why."
5760,0,A frantic Easter egg hunt of a film that does the bare minimum to please its loyal existing fanbase.
5761,1,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie was made for the fans. If you love the Mario games, or Nintendo in general, you'll have a lot of fun."
5762,0,"'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is super-nostalgic but not super-fun.  Granted, I haven't regularly played home video games since NBA Jam, circa 1995."
5763,0,"I wasn’t expecting Pixar, but the heroes end where they started, not having been transformed by their experiences or learning anything from them."
5764,1,"Leaning heavily into nostalgia The Super Mario Bros. Movie delivers fun action sequences. However, an over-reliance on Easter Eggs and pop music dampens the fun."
5765,0,"So much of the action in The Super Mario Bros. Movie is predicated on the gameplay itself, which certainly makes sense in theory, but is rendered here with all of the subtlety of a barrel-throwing gorilla, consistency be damned."
5766,1,The creative team seems to rely heavily on the nostalgia and the silliness of it all over taking this in a bold and new direction like The LEGO Movie.
5767,1,"""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is bombastic, silly and full of energy. Driven by spectacular voice work provided by an A-list cast the film gets props for both being able to appeal to fans of the game and just regular viewers. It's a very fun watch."
5768,1,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie warps you back into childhood with nostalgia and dino eggs. Impeccably animated with a score that’s an utter delight, the film captures the charm and appeal the game has evoked for decades."
5769,0,"Mario’s animated movie debut is too safe and passive, more content with referencing its source material than playing with it."
5770,1,"If 2023's The Super Mario Bros Movie is a response to its predecessor, it's a happily dutiful one, doing its utmost to copy the video game. The strongest feeling it inspires: making viewers want to bust out their old NES or SNES or Game Boy."
5771,1,"More true to the game than the 90s abomination, but still just a silly cartoon mostly for kids."
5772,1,The film belts along with an assault of candy colours and a commendable command of canonical detail.
5773,0,"Nostalgia might be the only thing that warps you through this one dimensional adaptation. Though peppered with candy coated visuals and chock full of easter eggs for hardcore Nintendo fans, the story (or lack thereof) leaves one wanting a power up."
5774,0,"What it seems to have forgotten is creating an engaging story. It's bland, uninteresting and cobbled together."
5775,1,This is a love letter to the world of Super Mario and a joy to dive into.
5776,1,While The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s ambitions don’t stretch far beyond telling a competent story featuring these beloved characters… it at least succeeds at that.
5777,0,It’s emotionally bland and yet garish enough to psychologically sedate the pre-teen Easter audience.
5778,1,"Not to give damning praise, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie sets its narrative sights refreshingly low. ... It trusts the cultural cache of Mario and decides to jump straight into the fun of what people love about the games."
5779,1,"It’s a great, fun, beautifully animated story of Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, Donkey Kong and a colorful, zany cast of Nintendo characters."
5780,0,If you’re hoping for an experience that will unite the generations around a lovely piece of popcorn cinema ... Dungeons & Dragons is still playing.
5781,1,“The Super Mario Bros.” Movie is an entertaining adaptation that stays true to its source material. A dream come true to fans who’ve played the game religiously and a visually stunning animated feature for the kiddos.
5782,1,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a joyous event that will bring excitement to all longtime Nintendo fans and players, giving them a new generational story that they can share with their children and families. This movie is playing with power."
5783,1,"... It's aimed squarely at children, and different again in that it feels rather desperately derivative. But — and it's a pint-sized 'but' — I watched it in a cinema full of kids, and most of them laughed all the way through."
5784,1,"Although its humor and story is aimed more toward kids, this animated adaptation of the beloved video game franchise offers a fun and colorful ride for everyone. [Full Review in Spanish]"
5785,0,"Assaults audiences with lots of action and color, but not much reason to care."
5786,1,A riveting war story that reveals the bonds that build between soldiers and interpreters
5787,1,"In telling a specific story of wartime camaraderie, the film offers good fodder for discussions of grace, guilt, and the gospel."
5788,1,It is a tight drama that looks at the war in Afghanistan in 2018 and its aftermath that works on multiple levels and is so finely written that it flows from beginning to end.
5789,0,"In a film that is supposed to focus on the tragedy of Afghan civilians during and after the war, it is at least disconcerting that the point of view is that of Sergeant Kinley... [Full review in Spanish]"
5790,0,I am really frustrated by this one even as a massive fan of Guy Ritchies...
5791,1,"The Covenant keeps the attention on the bond and relationship between the two men, and portrays it as a show of humanity amidst the barbaric. [Full review in Spanish]"
5792,1,"With the men's dynamic and their few words, The Covenant could've been a Western (and in a certain way it is). [Full review in Spanish]"
5793,1,"The Covenant is also known under its official title Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant, although I suppose a more accurate moniker might be Guy Ritchie’s The Killing Fields."
5794,1,"Ritchie did not have to put his name in the title of the strongest, most impressive film of his career. It’s a defining showcase that liberates him from his genre. It is Gyllenhaal’s most assured role. A highly realistic war film."
5795,1,"... uses the real-world experiences of many as inspiration for a dramatic wartime tale in which the bonds forged in battle cannot be undone, no matter time and distance."
5796,1,Gyllenhaal is good as the intense American sergeant...
5797,1,The Covenant is a disciplined and effective war movie with a real point to make about the civilian workers who were left behind.
5798,1,…as entertaining and exciting as it is thought provoking.
5799,1,"[Gyllenhaal 's] energy is perfect for the relatively sober-minded The Covenant — and allows space for Dar Salim to shine, in a more substantial lead than the majority of his Hollywood roles have afforded him so far."
5800,1,"…the film’s second half, largely focused Killing Fields-style on Kinney’s attempts to rescue Ahmed, is the exact opposite of the casual betrayal which took place in real life…"
5801,1,"Though the movie is fictional, the uncertain fate of thousands of real Afghan interpreters after the hurried 2021 US withdrawal gives it genuine heft."
5802,1,"Guy Ritchie's strategically shameful action thriller points an accusatory finger at broken covenants (promises) made to loyal Afghan interpreters/translators by the U.S. Government, leaving them stranded as prime targets for Taliban reprisals."
5803,1,"These set pieces are extraordinarily well done, brutal, and eye-opening to everyday dangers. Still, the final act would have worked better if it dealt with Ahmed's struggle to survive rather than Kinley's guilt and depression."
5804,0,The serious melodrama falters when it becomes little more than an action movie devoid of the melodrama.
5805,1,A searing war drama with considerable edge-of-your-seat moments.
5806,1,This feels like a breath of fresh air [for Guy Ritchie]. He is really reinvigorated by paring it down.
5807,1,"Like two films in one, this “Covenant” doesn’t seem like other examples, even though Ritchie embraces plenty of clichés. It works because the actors commit to the missions."
5808,1,"The reunion brought tears to my eyes--Guy Ritchie’s seasoned filmmaking career has created an excellent film of friendship, devotion, and the realistic horrors of war."
5809,1,Director Guy Ritchie dispenses with his usual fancy flourishes and keeps the action straight-forward...He ratchets up the tension as the urgency mounts in a cut-to-the-chase scenario that gives a sense of real-time heroics.
5810,1,"It's essentially a male-bonding story about two unlikely comrades saving each other's asses, and the screenplay does its due diligence by addressing the psychological trauma they endure."
5811,0,"A capably made but simple-minded rescue film, one with a big heart — even if it could have used more brain."
5812,1,Ritchie surprises with a much more conventional action movie. Dar Salim is excellent in this stripped-back soldier story that is more poignant than the trailers suggested.
5813,0,"In theory it is all there - the acting, the story, the direction - but it never seems to completely come together."
5814,1,"Like just about every Guy Ritchie work, Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant isn’t all it could have been. It deserves to be seen, though, and, at least for a while, remembered."
5815,1,The perfect two person story.
5816,1,"The intensity of the men's predicament might have been better served by Peter Berg or Paul Greengrass, both of whose frenetic styles more aptly fit the material."
5817,1,"The action scenes are well-staged, and there is plenty of suspense in the rescue scenes, too. Gyllenhaal, one of the best actors of his generation, shines in this role. He plays a man more haunted than idealistic."
5818,1,This gripping look at war gets under your skin.
5819,1,That Salim and Gyllenhaal are so good almost seems like an afterthought because Ritchie has us too involved in their characters' plight to get distracted by the artifice.
5820,1,"A deadly serious—and almost deadly earnest, in its portrait of duty, honor, and sacrifice—look at America’s failure to live up to its word to the interpreters on the ground in Afghanistan."
5821,1,It’s Gyllenhaal and Salim that make the movie leave a dent in the viewer long after the credits conclude. As men cut from a more similar cloth than either would like to admit-they’re both family men serving in a war-they make the quieter moments count.
5822,0,"It is as always important to reassure Americans that we at least mean well with our pointless destructive wars, not like “bad” countries... A person predisposed to believe that might find The Covenant enjoyable. I did not."
5823,1,"This is Ritchie at his most sedate and naturalistic, which makes sense in the context of this story."
5824,1,The Covenant doesn’t arouse the stirrings of fervor that many war movies tap into but neither is it a nihilistic descent into the inhumanity of battle.
5825,1,"""A taut military thriller with two fantastic performances, Guy Ritchie's The Covenant brings to mind the Afghans we left behind."""
5826,1,"Swinging back to a more serious register, Ritchie presents his first film grounded in harsh real-world politics, and it’s the best film he’s made in years."
5827,1,"Through the Herculean efforts of Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim, Guy Ritchie’s THE COVENANT is a gripping film exposing the horrors of the Afghanistan War."
5828,1,Guy Ritchie’s THE COVENANT is two hours of pure adrenaline as we wait for this remarkable story to unfold. It's a highly emotional journey that is impossible to dismiss.
5829,0,A dour lecture punctuated by some rousing action sequences.
5830,1,"The Covenant is a solid story of survival, respect, and honor, while still acknowledging the brutality and senselessness of war. It’s easy to get caught up in this journey, and one of Ritchie’s better recent efforts."
5831,1,"The director, coming off a run of successful action comedies, shifts into a moving but flawed tale of friendship in the war in Afghanistan."
5832,1,"The Covenant is nowhere near the ultimate cinematic statement on what happened in Afghanistan, but it is a riveting story worth telling from that battlefield."
5833,1,What we get is not only his most restrained and most focused movie in years. I think it’s Ritchie’s best movie in years period.
5834,1,What gives “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant” its solid footing is the twinned performances by Gyllanhaal and Salim.
5835,1,"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant offers an overly simplistic portrayal of an American rescue mission in Afghanistan. However, this action flick has solid performances and capably shows the importance of interpreters during war."
5836,1,"An uncharacteristically serious movie by director Guy Ritchie, this war-themed tale is simplistic but sturdy and effective thanks to crisp, energetic filmmaking and a touching emotional core."
5837,1,"The least Guy Ritchie film Guy Ritchie has yet made boasts a title bearing his name. Even as Ritchie quiets his quirks, there's still considerable style and scope here. Melancholy, mournful and meaty dramatic filmmaking that's less rah-rah, more requiem."
5838,1,"Harmful stuff comes with such nasty work, but so does the loyalty, friendship, and mutual respect that filmmaker Ritchie dramatizes just about perfectly after collecting these incidents for the big screen."
5839,1,Jake Gyllenhaal stars in skillfully made and gripping film...
5840,1,"The Covenant is a well crafted, action packed and intense drama expertly directed by Guy Ritchie featuring career best acting work from Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim. A film about the bonds of brotherhood that'll move you, enlighten you and uplift you!"
5841,1,"If you think Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is simply just another movie about war, you are in for a large and pleasant surprise."
5842,1,"For much of its running time, director Ritchie’s war movie manages to be topical, suspenseful, and moving. But partly because the story is fiction, Ritchie takes a few genre liberties that threaten to undermine the sincerity of his tale."
5843,0,"Much like Ritchie’s last feature, Mission:Impossible-wannabe Operation Fortune, The Covenant is completely devoid of any of the stylistic tics that once marked the director’s work."
5844,1,"The Covenant does merit bonus points for showcasing Salim, a terrific journeyman actor who finally has a meaty role in an American movie."
5845,1,"Ritchie pulls off the best film of his career in nearly 20 years thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal and his own no-fuss, no-muss approach to mean-and-lean filmmaking and storytelling."
5846,0,"This is not a true story. The truth is a disgrace. A throwback to those Chuck Norris ""Missing in Action"" films.  Gyllenhaal and Salim are fine. But this film is a fraud."
5847,1,Contains some of the most poetic imagery that Ritchie’s ever filmed
5848,0,"While the battle scenes are effective and visceral, I yearned for the dialogue to have a little more of the color and life that Ritchie’s known for. Most of the movie sounds like someone entered “Write a war movie” into ChatGPT."
5849,1,"This is a tense war drama, given more gravitas from the stellar performances of Gyllenhaal and Salim. As it goes along, it becomes a metaphor for the long slog that the U.S. got themselves into, as the “longest war” just ended recently. Good for? NOTHING!"
5850,1,"It’s a more than welcome break from Ritchie’s usual in-your-face style and suggests that Ritchie, just months away from turning 55, has finally matured as a filmmaker."
5851,0,"A muscular, overwrought war film."
5852,1,"Guy Ritchie is only one of a handful of directors known for a signature style. But he abandons it in ""The Covenant,"" a pretty straightforward but solidly executed war story."
5853,1,... resonates most powerfully by finding a fresh perspective on familiar themes of brotherhood and loyalty along the front lines.
5854,1,"A sober military thriller that excoriates Joe Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan in 2021 and, in the process, to strand the thousands of local interpreters who had risked their lives to aid the American cause."
5855,1,"It’s a dramatically effective action thriller, but “The Covenant” is also an uncomfortably jingoistic combat movie."
5856,1,"A serious military drama about valor, courage, honor, and the profound devotion of military personnel who serve alongside one another in times of war. Hope to see more spec ops military movies from director Guy Ritchie."
5857,0,How does it honor these brave and essential people to make a movie that isn’t about any of them but rather a near-superhuman fictional character?
5858,1,"It’s good to see Ritchie branch out — just like after “Snatch” and “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” he made us all do a double-take with “Aladdin.” Not everything works in “The Covenant,” but he’s not lost in the desert, either."
5859,1,"For all its clichés, this furious and discomfiting film tugs on your conscience for days, making a powerful case to turn the American public’s attention back to a conflict it would rather forget."
5860,0,The Covenant works best when the two leads are forced to be silent lest they tip off prowling combatants.
5861,1,"Hardly a revisionist film, either in terms of war movies in general or those about Afghanistan in particular; but as a tale of unlikely wartime comradeship, it’s a strong, compelling piece."
5862,0,"Though possibly well-intentioned, the execution of The Covenant ensures its narrative and thematic potential is drowned out in the roar of gunfire it becomes far too enamored by."
5863,1,"Guy Ritchie's film cuts through the complications ... to get at something so unquestionable that it is essentially an unmistakable, universal truth."
5864,1,"Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant delivers the action and suspense expected from the war movie genre and from Ritchie, yet ventures beyond expectations to create a moving drama."
5865,1,An oftentimes riveting war film which marks a new path for the 54-year-old filmmaker.
5866,1,"It’s unclear where this side of Guy Ritchie has been hiding all these years, but the juxtaposition of his regular fare to the well-done drama in The Covenant makes you wonder what else he might be able to do."
5867,1,Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim are superb in a visceral display of brotherhood on the battlefield. Guy Ritchie's The Covenant leaves no man behind.
5868,1,"Gyllenhaal, who’s looking more and more like a trimmer Javier Bardem, uses that handsome-hangdog face of his to good effect. Salim, an Iraqi-born Danish actor, is very good. If he weren’t, the movie simply wouldn’t work."
5869,1,"Instead of layering on jump cuts, crazy camera angles and jokey subtitles like he usually does, he keeps things calm. Ritchie lets the action unfold swiftly and clearly."
5870,1,The result is one of Ritchie’s finest films that’s made all the better by two extraordinary performances.
5871,1,"An absorbing, action-driven war movie with great performances form Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim."
5872,1,The most suspenseful and heartfelt movie in Guy Ritchie's career.
5873,1,"It about as exciting, gripping and moving as war films get -- especially one set in the murky Afghanistan conflict in which the U.S. found itself immersed for more than two decades."
5874,1,"Director Guy Ritchie exercises considerable restraint in his depiction of action: again and again, he is content to pull back, hold the shot, and let what happens be enough to engage the viewer. And again and again, it's more than enough."
5875,1,A masterfully manipulative war thriller...
5876,1,It's Guy Ritchie’s strongest film in quite some time. He feels at home with the genre and the focus needed to help the audience re-examine whatever feeling they have about the war in Afghanistan.
5877,0,Offers marginal entertainment value. It’s a film that seems afraid to offer any ideas about its setting and characters beyond the minimum.
5878,0,"Here, working from such familiar modern-warfare sentiment, Guy Ritchie's flash-bang technique becomes just another Hollywood grunt."
5879,1,"Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant is as sharp on deep human elements as it is with intensity, giving rise to a welcomed change in the director’s repertoire."
5880,1,"The Covenant is more than just a great action movie, it’s a movie with purpose."
5881,1,"Guy Ritchie's The Covenant is a pulse-pounding and visceral look At keeping a promise, with Jake Gyllenhaal compelling as ever."
5882,1,"The acting by Gyllenhaal and Dar Sajim, who plays Ahmed, is outstanding and I think no matter your political persuasion you’ll be rooting for these 2 men to save each other."
5883,1,Ritchie delivers his most mature film yet.  Without relying on his usual bag of tricks he delivers a thrilling and entertaining movie about the lengths two men will go to to do the right thing.
5884,1,"Outside of universal themes involving friendship, bonding, and bravery, I can’t say the Brit filmmaker is doing much to enlighten me on how he feels about the politics of it all, but his efforts to deliver a strong feature pay off."
5885,1,"Directed by Ritchie with breathless, propulsive momentum, ""The Covenant"" is really about two wars. There's the one in the battlefield and the other one at home when some soldiers went to great lengths to bring their abandoned interpreters to the U.S."
5886,1,"It's told entirely visually, which has its own fascinating effect."
5887,0,"The film is at once technically proficient and decently edited, but due to gimmick, No One Will Save You feels like a heartless exercise, less cinema than bad black-box theater."
5888,1,"Sure the dénouement won’t be for everyone, but if you want to be scared silly this Halloween, turn out the lights, turn off any distractions and tune in for an hour-and-a-half of unrelenting twists, turns – and jumps."
5889,0,"Though the film is an ambitious experiment, the final product is an unsatisfying, clumsy effort that fails to deliver a convincing resolution or generate an ounce of genuine empathy, enlightenment, or fear."
5890,1,"A terrific piece of sci-fi filmmaking allowing for the horror to flow through ours (the viewer) and the character's veins, as the pressure to survive becomes exponentially more dire."
5891,1,"Kaitlyn Dever jumps feet first and flourishes into a new genre with Angelina Jolie, Sigourney Weaver energy in this amalgamated sci-fi psychological horror thriller masterfully plotted by Brian Duffield"
5892,1,"Duffield borrows elements from Signs , Invasion of the Body Snatchers and War of the Worlds and the home invasion scenes become pretty repetitive. However, he deserves praise for taking his flick to places you don’t expect it to go."
5893,1,"Revolving around the theme of self-forgiveness, Brian Duffield's intense, ambiguous alien invasion saga is the best sci-fi thriller of 2023, so far."
5894,1,"To the extent that No One Will Save You holds together, it's because Brynn is such an intriguingly unlikely heroine."
5895,1,"A tense, taut and mostly dialogue-free little thriller that's expertly directed by Duffield and boasts a superb lead turn from Dever."
5896,1,"A UFO-tastic action/adventure/sci-fi/horror mash-up with a rock-solid lead performance, top-notch alien monsters, and bright blue tractor beams babyyyyyyyyyyy."
5897,1,"No One Can Save You possesses a tension that is at times unbearable, courtesy of a crossover of genres where science fiction, horror, and the so-called home invasion coexist... [Full review in Spanish]"
5898,0,"Sadly, the lack of dialogue feels more like a gimmick than a strength of the storytelling here. Dever is terrific as always but where it ends up going can't help but feel like a letdown."
5899,0,It presents a classic sci-fi invasion story while offering its own unique elements. But it overstays its welcome in some aspects that feel repetitive.
5900,1,"It is a horror film that's different, not only because it is very well made but also because it allows for a double reading. [Full review in Spanish]"
5901,1,"Dever commands the screen as the only character of note, doing a good job at wordlessly conveying awkwardness, guilt, melancholy and fear."
5902,1,"A nearly wordless alien invasion film that doesn't pull punches? Yes, Brian Duffield and Kaitlyn Dever have accomplished just that. It's incredible."
5903,1,"It lays on too many ideas in a frantic third act, making it hard to follow and near-impossible to digest. We cannot, however, fault its ambition. Duffield is on to something here, and a tremendous Dever just about holds it together. Half a great sci-fi."
5904,0,"Dever gives a charged performance defined by her physical commitment and latent traces of regret. It’s an anchor that holds a tenuous story in place for most of Brian Duffield’s movie, although landing the haywire conclusion is beyond even Dever’s reach."
5905,1,"Dever remains utterly transfixing every second she's on screen... you're with her the entire film, and she really sells it."
5906,1,"The film doesn’t always work, but when it does and when its thrills are woven together with its themes, it hits heights that bigger blockbusters could only dream of."
5907,1,"The filmmaking, proceeding by image and sound alone, is nicely accomplished pure cinema. There wouldn’t be much of a movie, though, if it didn’t have an expressive actor like Kaitlyn Dever at its center."
5908,1,Dever is simply exceptional. And the movie as a whole is about as high quality of a genre picture as you could hope to find while scrolling through Hulu.
5909,1,…the dreamlike No One Will Save You is intense and gripping as Kaitlyn’s situation unfolds; it’s only afterwards that wound-up audiences will be left searching for more information about what they’ve just seen…
5910,1,"As in the best films, less is more and with the right resources and locations you can weave a perfect fable in which the most restorative dreams are without a doubt the cruelest nightmares. [Full review in Spanish]"
5911,1,Kaitlyn Dever is quietly becoming one of the all-time greats.
5912,1,"It never becomes a turn-off, even if it might leave you not fully buying into its strangeness."
5913,1,No One Will Save You is a film that stuck with me. Everything I like in movies is here.
5914,1,A delightful Alien invasion sci-fi thriller with a rather unexpected 3rd act.
5915,1,The result is an intense and often ingenious exercise in suspense.
5916,0,"Ultimately though, the payoff feels slightly more confusing or pointless than either of those, giving No One Will Save You points for bold effort and skillful moviemaking without a final, captivating twist..."
5917,1,"On a technical level, No One Will Save You is a strong effort, but outside of that, it fails to be overly compelling, save for Dever’s engaging performance."
5918,1,"We might be witnessing the earliest signs of the arrival of a prominent new voice in American genre cinema, a true successor to M Night Shyamalan."
5919,1,"A really well done, old school, crazy-headed alien invasion movie featuring and incredible central performance."
5920,1,"The sound design is excellent, the decision to almost entirely avoid dialogue daring, but No One Will Save You unravels somewhat in a hurried ending, and should perhaps have remained small and resisted the temptation to explain itself."
5921,1,This nearly dialogue-less feat is entirely carried by Dever’s performance.
5922,1,[E]xpertly paced and gets endless mileage from its premise. ... [A] brilliant lead performance by Kaitlyn Dever. ... [T]he best horror film of 2023 so far.
5923,1,A film that truly stands out in the often interchangeable genre of horror. [Full review in Spanish]
5924,0,A well-crafted genre thriller that is ultimately tripped up by its arthouse aspirations.
5925,1,"A very interesting, beautiful, and entertaining movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
5926,1,"Right up front, I will say this is a very effective home invasion thriller featuring some extraterrestrial edge. If anyone plans to go in blind, now is the time to watch this film, as it’s pretty solid and features some neat surprises."
5927,1,Brian Duffield is a strong visual storyteller who packs an emotional punch with No One Will Save You.
5928,1,It's an impressive piece of craftsmanship that immediately grabs the audience's attention and doesn't let go for 90 minutes.
5929,1,"No One Will Save You is a terrifying, immersive and revealing experience... [Full review in Spanish]"
5930,1,"Chalk that up to a riveting performance by Dever, on screen for the entirety of No One Will Save You, as well as to a tightly constructed story."
5931,1,"This one is the year’s best horror movie, not to mention one of 2023’s very best, period."
5932,1,"Dever’s commitment functions as the glue that keeps it together, and keeps us in our seats."
5933,1,This was incredibly unique & clever take on a home/alien invasion with great direction and a home run of a performance from Kaitlyn Dever. The sound design is top notch. This is a lean 90 min creative & thrilling experience that I can’t recommend enough…
5934,0,"If you saw the trailer and are watching this one wishing to be scared, don't get your hopes up. The 93-minute plot mostly plays out like a long game of hide-and-seek..."
5935,1,"No One Will Save You is a close encounter you will welcome, a wild, outstanding, terrifically conceived marriage of big screen popcorn thrill and joyously independent cinema soul..."
5936,1,"Duffield's film is a minimalist thriller, virtually dialogue-free, brilliantly simple, and deftly poignant."
5937,1,"Screenwriter Duffield (Underwater) once again writes a contained film, focused on the minute-by-minute events, where all the weight falls on a prodigious Dever who, without saying a single word, conveys her character's conflict... [Full review in Spanish]"
5938,1,"A science fiction thriller that stands out above all, due to its good ideas. [Full review in Spanish]"
5939,1,"No One Will Save You is a delightful surprise, and it comes just in time for spooky season. It’s a tight, focused thriller with a unique concept..."
5940,1,"No One Will Save You is a well-made film. However, the lack of dialogue impedes the film more than it complements."
5941,1,"With spine-tingling horror and plenty of thrills, No One Will Save You is a disturbing sci-fi horror that demands lights off, phones away and eyes glued to the screen."
5942,1,"A close encounter of the wordless kind, this is a smart and splendidly scary horror sci-fi, with a brilliantly brittle turn from Kaitlyn Dever."
5943,1,"This mesmerizing genre mash-up surprises at every turn, defying predictability and keeping us guessing all the way through to its final shot."
5944,1,"No One Will Save You counts on Kaitlyn Dever’s powerfully expressive, virtually speechless performance to carry a classic sci-fi premise of alien invasion filled with truly tense moments perfectly executed by Brian Duffield."
5945,1,"If 'No One Will Save You' had been longer, the stage would have thinned out. However, the feature is just the right length for jolts and character development to keep you locked in past the bleeps and bloops"
5946,0,A competently directed movie.
5947,1,"Despite its repetitiveness...and a last act that overindulges Duffield’s penchant for quirkiness—the movie remains fascinating as an imaginative take on a genre staple...helped enormously by the virtuoso performance of Dever,"
5948,0,No One Will Save You’s downfall stems from its ongoing absence of dialogue...
5949,1,Kaitlyn Dever is dynamite in an alien invasion thriller that loses its way.
5950,0,"But as a feature film, it’s a bloated, repetitious exercise that quickly taxes the patience and breaks the spirit of anyone unfortunate enough to stumble upon it."
5951,1,"In Duffield’s capable hands, a journey through self-forgiveness gets transformed into a propulsive, nerve-fraying sci-fi twist on home invasion horror."
5952,1,It’s rare for a film to take something we have seen countless times before and make us feel like we were experiencing it for the first time.
5953,1,"Kaitlyn Dever is tremendous and immensely watchable here, whether panicking, fighting back, or giving nuanced reactions to hateful townsfolk. As a bare-bones tale of survival, this is finely crafted and taut"
5954,1,It’s a twisty and innovative thriller with more depth than you might expect.
5955,1,"Tense and strongly leaning into its horror roots, this thriller is propped up by a great performance by Kaitlyn Dever."
5956,1,"Dever more than proves that she can command a movie on her own, and Duffield once again shows that he’s got some of the best eyes for original genre stories in the biz."
5957,1,No One Will Save You is at its best when it marries the tension of a home invasion thriller with the thrills of an alien abduction film.
5958,1,An emotionally-charged psychological thriller that also works as a thrill-a-minute creature feature.
5959,0,"Some great visual storytelling, but eventually the simple themes and metaphor wears thin."
5960,1,"From peaceful solitude, to chest-clenching anxiety, to unbridled panic, to wrenching heartbreak, Brynn’s whole emotional journey is powerfully told through Kaitlyn Dever’s near-wordless performance, and it’s arresting in every moment."
5961,0,"As CGI aliens chase her around the house, the script becomes frustratingly repetitive as Brynn makes dumb decisions that will have you yelling at the screen: not locking her bedroom door, not telling the police what’s happening, leaving her car door open."
5962,0,"What starts out as a thrilling alien invasion story with legitimately frightening, classic horror elements flounders in a too-familiar narrative rut of trauma and healing."
5963,0,"By the end of the rambling mess of a last act, it’s clear that no one could have saved this."
5964,1,"“No One Will Save You” is an uncomplicated package of tension with practically no dialogue (the screenplay must’ve been relatively short), instead relying on Dever’s performance and filmmaking techniques to set the tone and keep the audience invested."
5965,1,"It’s easy to admire the film for everything it isn’t, and for zealously adhering to the cinematic rule to show, not tell."
5966,1,This film feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone. It is packed with intense moments and unsuspected twists. Kaitlyn Dever proves that she is a phenomenal actress.
5967,1,"Daringly creative, No One Will Save You is as much of an in-the-moment good time as it is worthy of lingering thought and discussion."
5968,0,"A tiring cycle of cat-and-mouse capture, release, and recapture sequences with no clarity."
5969,1,"It’s taut and thrilling, weird and fun, and delightful and moving."
5970,1,"This movie had a lot of ambition and amazing ideas however, While It did fall off for me a little bit towards the third act, Kaitlyn Dever provides an amazing performance with little to no reading lines! A great Sci-Fi thriller entry!"
5971,0,"Dever communicates shrewdly through body language and facial expressions. However, the film withholds so much context that it diminishes suspense and tests the limits of our emotional investment."
5972,1,No One Will Save You is a gorgeous film and an atmospheric one that trusts its audience to solve the story without heavy exposition.
5973,1,"Dim lighting, deep shadows, excellent creature designs, and a semi-sympathetic character, all complement the nervous tone. But the movie fumbles the ending by creating a dynamic that conflicts with all we’ve been shown previously."
5974,0,"Instead of a challenge of filmmaking, it instead becomes a maximalist adventure that is just as confusing as it is experimental."
5975,0,"If this movie had started where it ended, I'd like it so much more."
5976,1,Kaitlyn Dever’s one-woman show excels in this near-wordless sci-fi horror thriller.
5977,0,"It's a neat experiment, but with its heightened extraterrestrial conceit, Duffield works against the suspenseful core of this story a bit too much."
5978,1,An absolutely outstanding cinematic experience...
5979,1,No One Will Save You is a mix of high-concept and classic genre tropes that wouldn't work without a compelling and captivating lead performance from Dever.
5980,1,"Duffield continues his streak as one of the more exciting filmmakers tackling genre fare. The string of Spontaneous, Love & Monsters, and his latest science fiction hair-raiser all brim with heart in unexpected places."
5981,1,"This movie doesn't f*** around, folks."
5982,1,"Kaitlyn Dever plays a woman flight-or-fighting for her life in this stylish, moody, aliens-as-serial-killers thriller out on Hulu."
5983,1,"What follows after that is entirely surprising, deftly plotted by writer Brian Duffield and superbly staged by director Brian Duffield, elevated by a bravura performance by Kaitlyn Dever, who is, not just likable, but entirely empathetic."
5984,0,"The film has a lot of promise, but in the end, it simply just doesn’t deliver."
5985,1,"A visually striking and periodically exciting chiller that heads in unusual directions, shaking off predictability early as the story finds ways to thrill and touch on the human condition."
5986,1,"For someone as memed as Wes Anderson, you’d think he’d stop surprising us."
5987,0,"An exercise of self-indulgence and soulless nonsense. To say this film is style over substance is a giant understatement, as everything plays second fiddle to the director's trademark visuals."
5988,1,"[W]hile it might seem the plot is just a shallow, zany, brightly coloured excuse to set Alex Colville paintings in a desert, Asteroid City (both Anderson's actual movie, and the play within it) are a mournful meditation on art, art-making and purpose."
5989,1,"I know people who are bored and maddened by Anderson’s films, and I’m increasingly sympathetic to those views. Nevertheless, his methods are so idiosyncratic it would be glib to ever write him off."
5990,1,"While Asteroid City does have some issues, when it comes to its pacing and some plot points, it’s a very quick watch."
5991,1,"I love the enigma of Asteroid City, particularly its existence as a sort of Rubik’s cube. Figuring out how the layers of the film work is akin to solving the cube in that nothing is necessarily lost or gained, but there’s joy in the process."
5992,1,"Maybe in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City the play means nothing, maybe it means everything, and maybe he just wants the audience to keep watching the story."
5993,1,"Even if Asteroid City isn’t going to win any new fans since it comes at the cost of a rewarding plot, Wes Anderson continues to be original and distinctive in his esoteric way."
5994,1,"Scarlett Johansson stands out with a finely-tuned performance. The film has a host of other delightful turns, most notably from Bryan Cranston."
5995,1,"Asteroid City, in which Wes Anderson’s troupe of characters struggle to reconcile the finiteness of life with the infinite mysteries of the cosmos they’re confronted with, is the director's funniest, most piercing movie yet."
5996,1,"Anderson continues to be a cinematic tour de force, and Asteroid City stands as a shining example of his ability to transport us to places that exist at the crossroads of imagination and reality."
5997,0,The three layers of story is overkill and gets in the way of what could have been a good story on its own. For the first time Wes Anderson has disappointed me.
5998,1,"Aesthetically, it is formidable, combining a 50s look with a vintage Americana-style use of colour. There are definitely no complaints there. The problem, rather, is in the narrative —and in how distant the protagonists feel. Full review in Spanish."
5999,1,"Far from being a self-indulgent practice of superfluous beauty, it is a movie that can be enjoyed from beginning to end without failing to explore ideas with certain depth. [Full review in Spanish]"
6000,1,My time inside the Asteroid City limits was simply a flawless almost spiritual cinematic experience for me.
6001,1,"Asteroid City may not be at Tenenbaums, Rushmore or Zissou level, but it is still a joyful take on sensitive topics such as nostalgia, loss and melancholy, beautifully enhanced by Anderson's  personal and crafty style."
6002,1,"The clever, detailed yet ambiguous style of story-telling that is the Wes Anderson signature can be an acquired taste, yet despite talent squandered on this occasion, there is still nothing quite like it"
6003,0,"A comedy that enjoys a certain splendor with Anderson's visual stylization, but whose substance is lost in the immensity of an artificial town inhabited, as a rule, by characters without grace and absurd situations. [Full review in Spanish]"
6004,1,"Paralleling the creative process and crisis survival, Anderson shows how both situations require a consoling, collaborative community as participants wrestle with the notion of whether temporal connections will endure upon reentry or even matter."
6005,1,"Two themes or moods seem to predominate in Asteroid City: first, despite the entertaining-humorous elements, a general melancholy, a restrained, hushed quality; second, the sense that the writer-director is to a considerable extent overwhelmed by events."
6006,1,"Through alien invasion, inventors, playwrights and camp kids, Anderson supplies a gorgeously fresh and touching tale of humans trying to do their “thing” right, whatever that may be... every audience member should be able to relate, pastels and all."
6007,1,A brilliant movie about the Atomic Age trapped inside a dumb framing device about art.
6008,0,"Wes Anderson's latest is an odd, meandering mess, littered with uninteresting characters and a narrative device that's more distracting than helpful."
6009,1,"The film is, for the most part, a delight. I would never miss a Wes Anderson movie, and I encourage anyone looking for something offbeat and original to go and see Asteroid City."
6010,1,The latest exercise in quirk from Wes Anderson finds the writer-director in a typically playful mood.
6011,1,Asteroid City draws on themes and imagery that saw profound hope in a future that never came to be. The melancholy of false dreams similarly weighs heavily on the film.
6012,1,A  sincere ode to a lost age of American innocence.
6013,1,"As usual, I marvelled at the richly furnished nature of Anderson’s imagination, but I couldn’t help looking back on earlier, simpler times in his career."
6014,1,"The acolytes, in change, will once again be dazzled by the imagination of a filmmaker that doesn't stop generating ideas to his own unmistakable way of understanding reality. [Full review in Spanish]"
6015,1,"Asteroid City is more of a stylistic exercise, a training session for the director of The Royal Tenenbaums or The French Dispatch, rather than a work like The Grand Budapest Hotel. [Full review in Spanish]"
6016,0,"A day later, I can barely remember an emotion that it stirred. I came away from Asteroid City wishing I'd seen something that was less concerned with being a ""Wes Anderson film"" and more invested in being, y'know, just a great film."
6017,1,The only guarantee with Asteroid City is that it demands a willingness to appreciate the unorthodox. The viewer must also be willing to accept that there may or may not be a meaning to the stunningly presented tale.
6018,1,"As is invariably the case with a Wes Anderson movie, there are many strange and eccentric characters to be discovered, followed and farewelled here."
6019,1,"Wading through yearning, mourning, disappointments and the unknown, Schwartzman and Johansson in particular are astronomically spectacular."
6020,1,Its a Wes Anderson movie and he does as he pleases. Take it or leave it. [Full review in Spanish]
6021,1,Bill Murray's absence is felt; he's the only actor who can make us laugh and successfully convey the director's existential anguish. [Full review in Spanish]
6022,0,"As lovely as the look of the film is, Asteroid City is a compendium of meandering digressions, aimless vignettes, dry performances and wet witticisms that make it a very unengaging and dull outing."
6023,1,… consistently funny and mind-blowingly constructed …
6024,1,"Asteroid City is funny, in its odd way. And while the story seems to go nowhere in particular, and, at first glance, might seem to be “about nothing,” it could also be interpreted as being about everything."
6025,1,"While Anderson’s die-hard fans may enjoy the director’s enthusiasm for stylistic innovation, others might find themselves looking for a more rounded experience."
6026,1,Presents us a dream within a dream as it ponders our place in the cosmos by setting its story in three separate realities that bump into each other the way subatomic particles swarm around an atomic nucleus.
6027,1,"The effect of all this, although I’m still trying to figure out how Anderson could get such a result from these elements, is not trickery or philosophy but a sort of innocence. We are awake and also dreaming."
6028,1,"There’s been an evolution to Anderson’s filmmaking, and with Asteroid City, his inimitable directorial style has reached a whole new level of precision engineering."
6029,1,"A meta weird commentary... and at times if you try to figure it out you can get lost in all of it. And I think to a certain extent in terms of the story, Wes Anderson probably got lost a little lost in all of it too."
6030,1,"Asteroid City has its head looking up to the stars, its feet on the ground, and its heart just barely peeking out of its sleeve."
6031,1,One of Wes Anderson's best films; one I will be thinking about for quite some time. I hope Wes continues to ask the more meaningful questions even if there are no clear answers to why we're all here & why we create art to begin with. Just tell the story.
6032,1,"Asteroid City is not Wes Anderson's greatest film. Not even close, really. It is, however, the most Wes Anderson-y film that Wes Anderson has ever made. It may not be peak Wes, but it is undoubtedly maximum Wes. The only place to go from here is sideways."
6033,0,"With a familiar color palette and star-studded ensemble, Asteroid City is a melancholic entry that suffers from being too Wes Anderson."
6034,1,"Anderson is digging his heels in on his idiosyncratic approach to emotion here... In another way, though, Asteroid City might have what it takes to convert Anderson’s non-believers."
6035,1,"For the first time in a while, I remembered what it felt like to be all in with Anderson, and it made me want to watch all over again."
6036,1,"Asteroid City is an absolute triumph, delivering in all aspects from it's cinematography to it's original score. Wes Anderson proves that he still has a lot more to say, as Asteroid City becomes one of his strongest in recent years."
6037,0,"It feels like two different movies forcefully amalgamated into one incongruous whole, rendering its existential meditation on grief emotionally inert and hollow... It’s very much Anderson’s weakest entry to date."
6038,1,"When the film focuses on their relationship & the themes of parenthood and grieving, that’s when it was at it best for me. I normally like Wes corky and off beat humor, but I didn’t find a lot of the humor to work."
6039,0,"He [Wes Anderson] is making the same film over, and over, and over again. It's a waste of all the fantastic actors. I would skip this film"
6040,1,Everyone leaves the town (and exits stage left) and goes on with their lives. But these moments they spent together will leave a mark on them.
6041,1,"Wes Anderson’s latest cinematic adventure, Asteroid City, is a meticulously designed feast for the eyes with a story that is perfectly satisfactory."
6042,1,Asteroid City is arguably Anderson’s greatest artistic achievement and his most thematically dense.
6043,0,"Brilliant Production Design, Cinematography, and whimsical score can't save what is one of Wes Anderson's weakest films."
6044,1,"Asteroid City is another colourful, extravagant offering from one of Hollywood’s most celebrated Directors."
6045,0,"I appreciated Adam Stockhausen’s fanciful production design and Robert Yeoman’s lovely cinematography, but they aren’t enough to send you running off to see the movie. Ultimately, “Asteroid City” wobbles into being far too quirky and much too precious."
6046,1,"It offers far more than can be taken in at one viewing, and leaves itself wide open for interpretation."
6047,1,"Wes has presented one of the most political movies in years, putting on a literal spotlight on a figure that has been in the shadows, so there's no question as to who's telling the stories. [Full review in Spanish]"
6048,0,"Is it well made? Sure. The art direction is precious, perfect, contrived, impeccable. It all looks good. But it adds up to absolutely nothing. It’s a fraud."
6049,1,"Fans of Wes Anderson will lose their mind over this one, but if you don’t like his style, you’ll roll your eyes throughout."
6050,1,Anderson keeps showing us the seams of the production but otherwise plays each scene with emotional sincerity.
6051,1,A wondrous combination of 1950s Americana and Wes Anderson’s signature style.
6052,1,"The filmmaker still delivers a beautiful, exciting, and interesting movie in a way only Wes Anderson could."
6053,1,"Asteroid City finds Anderson leaning ever heavier into his Andersonness, as unconcerned as ever whether you love or hate it. I believe the film to be his most visually and thematically ambitious, and a potential masterpiece."
6054,1,"Two years after his last picture, The French Dispatch, Anderson has once again delivered a cinematic treat in the form of Asteroid City, a smorgasbord for the eyes, the ears, and the funny bone. And it is extraordinary."
6055,1,"It is easily Anderson’s weirdest film since The Life Aquatic, and one of the most impressive of his career."
6056,0,"Asteroid City is equal parts tackiness and boredom. As a result, I urge you to avoid being quarantined by this desert of ideas."
6057,1,"The pieces fit like a jigsaw, and Anderson’s toggling between the widescreen color vistas of Asteroid City and the boxy screen ratio of the black-and-white TV segments ensure that the foreground story and the background commentary never get confused."
6058,1,"If you’re a Wes Anderson fan, you’ll love it. If you’re not – or you don’t know who he is – this will prove even more confusing."
6059,1,A play within a film about learning to see the world and all its surprises with wide-awake eyes.
6060,1,Wes Anderson never fails to deliver HIMSELF in every frame of his work.
6061,0,"No one’s diagnosing anybody, but this may be a clarifying way to think of Anderson’s films, and why, for all of their dazzlement and brain power, they often fail to connect in ways that far dumber, far plainer films often can."
6062,1,"At once delightfully quirky, genuinely hilarious and profoundly sad."
6063,1,"The pastel wonderland is a feast for the eyes. It incorporates the spirit of animation, and it’s the perfect backdrop to the film’s zaniness, plus this is a terrific cast. However, the film moves too fast as it becomes style over substance."
6064,0,My reaction to Anderson films such as The Grand Budapest Hotel and The French Dispatch is frothing rage. Asteroid City created the same effect.
6065,1,"All in the jam-packed cast get a spotlight to use their talents for these quirky characters. Anderson’s rambling film is everything from silly and absurd, mildly farcical, and ludicrous. But it’s also uniquely imaginative and fun!"
6066,0,Anderson has neglected his characters' appeal and transcendence in lieu of an aesthetic that's splendorous yet artificial. [Full review in Spanish]
6067,0,"Amazing production work and a dream team cast can't salvage this unfunny, joyless smugfest comedy-drama. For worse, it's Wes Anderson's most Wes Anderson film yet. [Full review in Spanish]"
6068,1,"It's playful, loopy, endlessly inventive, awash in the creative approach to cinema that has been the Texan filmmaker's signature from his early work in the 1990s."
6069,1,"Despite the film's disjointed narrative structure, I found the characters, with their vulnerability, confusion and longing, quite appealing."
6070,0,"It's questionable he ever tried, but it would now appear that Wes Anderson's completely abandoned trying to appeal to mainstream audiences, and will from here on out cater exclusively to his diehard fans. If you're a fan, you'll love ""Asteroid City."""
6071,1,Asteroid City is stylistically undifferentiated from most of Anderson’s recent output but it does do one thing differently – it literally takes the audience behind the curtain of what makes him tick.
6072,1,Anderson pulls you in with a calm and deliberate delivery and then forces you to pay attention with a spectacle you didn’t see coming.
6073,1,This is much more Wes Anderson asking questions than giving answers.
6074,1,Every scene feels handstitched by a man who clings so tightly to his own vision that he has become a household name in the same vein as Christopher Nolan or Tim Burton.
6075,1,"A lovely, warm, heartfelt work that won't likely win over any converts to those who find Anderson's style anathema, but for those who don't, Asteroid City feels like a balm for a wounded heart."
6076,1,"You can imitate the surface with flat performance and fussed-over mise-en-scène, but the qualities that make Anderson one of our greatest living filmmakers are more elusive. His secret sauce remains secret — perhaps even from the artist himself."
6077,1,“Asteroid City” is a visually gorgeous story that left me reevaluating how to interpret and discuss art.
6078,1,"Put it all together and you get another breezy escape into Anderson's singular quirk that ultimately makes you nostalgic for his earlier, objectively stronger work."
6079,1,"Anderson’s familiar blend of precocious whimsy and melancholy nostalgia is tinged with a more profound sadness this time around, even if it is effectively counter balanced by a light heart."
6080,1,A wonderful world in which to spend some time. Which is what [Anderson] always delivers.
6081,0,Watching [it] feels more like taking a test than seeing a film: a test of your appreciation and knowledge of pop-culture artifacts and your willingness to follow dozens of characters down a rabbit-hole of retro cinematic and literary symbols and images.
6082,1,"As a fan of the sun-swept retro aesthetic Anderson channels in the desert scenes, I was mesmerized by images such as the delicate shadow of a trellis or cherry-patterned curtains framing salmon-colored sands."
6083,0,This latest Wes Anderson movie is more entertaining to think about than to watch.
6084,1,"Between ASTEROID CITY and THE FRENCH DISPATCH, we are in a distinctly new more experimental era of Wes Anderson and I'm utterly here for it."
6085,1,"At this point in his career, one has the sense that Wes Anderson’s films are, on some level, mimicking his previous work."
6086,1,The claustrophobia in The Humans transcends its confined narrative setting...
6087,1,"The Humans is A24‘s scariest film of the year. One that does reveal the truth that no matter how we may appear on the service, true horror and hell is other people…"
6088,1,"How does making the work resemble a horror movie add anything to our understanding of the Blakes and their relationships, to each other and to the world? It might be one of those overly clever conceptions that should have been set aside."
6089,0,The only thing The Humans evokes is viewer indigestion and indignation.
6090,1,Far creepier and more haunting than your usual movie about America's turkey-eating time of year — a hefty helping of existential horror will do that.
6091,1,"Keeping things downbeat, first-time director Stephen Karam, adapting his namesake Tony-winning play, elicits a batch of strongly understated performances and creates a pungent, naturalistic ambience."
6092,1,Director Stephen Karam’s punchy adaptation of his stage play pulses with compassion and regret.
6093,1,"A simple film that takes simpleness to the next level, provoking the sensation one should find in a perverse and macabre horror film... [Full review in Spanish]"
6094,1,The Humans is a dynamite directorial debut for Stephen Karam and a showcase for two of the finest performances of the year from Richard Jenkins and Jayne Houdyshell.
6095,1,Love and family can be a messy combination and the movie shows that with an affecting clarity.
6096,1,"Like any good dialogue-driven movie with theatre roots, it success lies in the cast's commitment and versatility and all six of them are up to the challenge. [Full review in Spanish]"
6097,1,"In bringing together a flawed family, the film acknowledges that to know someone is to also know exactly how to hurt them."
6098,1,"Far braver and more effective than most films even try to be, and for something that looks on its face to be a conventional family drama, that is cause for celebration."
6099,0,Tempting to say it's elevated horror so lofty you'll need a telescope--which is almost literally true of The Humans itself.
6100,1,"Its the subtext here thats so complex, especially as each individual person navigates the unspoken tension and validates their place in the familial social structure."
6101,1,"Ostensibly an emotionally engaging family-gathering-for-the-holidays drama, complete with the traditional secrets and lies, but the script, setting and sound design make it more chilling than any recent horror movie."
6102,1,"In an era where horror films tend to leave folks unsatisfied, The Humans follows in The Fathers footsteps in creating an atmospheric feel that will leave viewers unsettled and haunted."
6103,1,"While there are various undeniable good ideas and Jayne Houdyshell truly is stunning, it is a film that lacks the craft or thought to do these ideas or efforts justice."
6104,1,What starts as a family drama fades into a psychological thriller with the setting of the sun. Frivolous conversation turns to the familys darkest secrets being revealed. The entire cast is exceptional.
6105,1,"It's a compelling, sometimes satirical affair, which cumulatively builds to a unnerving summation of the discontents of modern city life."
6106,1,"The Humans is a fabulous looking film, and a beautifully performed one, too, packing its dysfunctional set-up with unsettling wit and searing, psychological drama. A note-perfect ensemble piece."
6107,1,"Karam never loses sight of this family, who are seen to exhibit a decay mirrored in the physical disrepair around them."
6108,0,Oh the misery. Oh the inert drama. Keep the tour moving; there's nothing to see here.
6109,1,"This is a brilliantly acted ensemble piece, full of claustrophobic energy and very funny, but its thesis is not cheerful."
6110,1,"This is a surprisingly cinematic adaptation with immersive direction and ingenious sound design. Richard Jenkins is award-worthy in a layered role. Steven Yeun, Beanie Feldstein and Amy Schumer co-star."
6111,1,The template is still predictable - unhappy secrets come to light as the conversation wears on - but the family's woes ring true and the actors are deft...
6112,1,"This is more than just a nihilistic revamp of Home for the Holidays. It's bleaker than that, more forensic in its analysis of innate human hopelessness."
6113,1,"The casting is... first-rate, with Richard Jenkins and a wounded, garrulous Jayne Houdyshell the standouts."
6114,1,"It's easy to see how Karam's unwieldy approach will turn many viewers off, but The Humans is one of the most tonally adventurous, skin-crawlingly uneasy films in recent memory."
6115,1,The ensemble remains electrifying against the damp.
6116,1,The result is like an expressionist horror by Polanski.
6117,1,There's palpable dread throughout this stagey but nevertheless evocative whirlwind of dysfunction.
6118,1,"[Writer-director Stephen Karam's] dialogue -- overlapping, percussive, ultimately musical -- is as exquisitely observed as it is immaculately performed by this cracking cast. It's as if Samuel Beckett had written a sitcom."
6119,1,A clever script and spooky sound design hint at long-held secrets and simmering tensions.
6120,1,"The Humans is a well executed, eerie and enthralling exercise in the uncanny which paints a puzzling yet gripping picture of the modern American family."
6121,1,It's rare that a single-set theatre piece can be adjusted for a new medium and still translate with the same harrowing reverb as it did on stage.
6122,1,Karam's directorial flourishes tease out the psychological nuances of his script in ways that transcend any hint of staginess.
6123,1,"Stephen Karam's The Humans (adapted from Karam's own play) is a treat for anyone who loves to watch actors act and bounce off of each other, developing rich and recognisable characters and relationships over the course of a film."
6124,1,"When the mess hits the fan in the third act, the reason for the movie's restlessness becomes clear. That will be the moment you'll decide if this movie was worthwhile or not."
6125,1,"It retains the savage smarts of the show, while also carrying an inspiring desire to explore the newfound depths that can be brought by a movie's comparatively more open landscape."
6126,1,[Houdyshell's is] a devastating performance that shows the cost of this family's dysfunction and the beating heart that wills it to stick together despite its cracks.
6127,1,"It's not an enjoyable film, but it's a very well-made film."
6128,1,"The Humans touches on nearly every anxiety coursing through the world today and comes up with a sympathetic, relatable sense of futility."
6129,1,"Plenty of audiences will relate to this story, it's just like all of us, it's incredibly Human."
6130,1,"Even not packing a gut-punch, the film tickles then pinches, advancing confidently toward a satisfying conclusion."
6131,1,"The unnerving atmosphere is set very early on and, despite the family's tendency toward making jokes and laughing uproariously, is mostly unrelenting."
6132,1,"At times, unexplained booming noises from upstairs, burned-out lights, and the claustrophobia of it all shade the ambience into horror movie territory. Chekhov by electric lamplight, A24 style, for the holidays."
6133,1,A collision of horror and humor that's as human as it is cringeworthy
6134,1,"In an effort to create some sort of ominous tension in the proceedings, [Karam] teeters awfully close to making the apartment something of a haunted house."
6135,1,"The Humans features no ghosts, monsters, or poltergeists. It's not set inside a haunted house, an abandoned building, or a tract of shadowy woods. And yet, it might be the scariest movie of the year."
6136,1,"Whatever its overreaches and miscalculations, The Humans is an imperfect symbol of the type of attentive, clear-eyed, midrange American production that deserves a surer foothold within American movies."
6137,1,It's a film that firmly plants itself in the twilight zone of family intercourse ... and pulls on threads of insecurity and resentment to the point of snapping.
6138,1,"Ambitiously adapting his award-winning play for the big screen, Stephen Karam creates a vivid fantastical sensibility around a naturalistic family gathering."
6139,1,"The cast is skilled and accomplished, but some characters and their problems are barely sketched in, while others are magnified by the old ""blurt my problems out in the third act"" trick."
6140,1,"The performances are quite good; everyone here is being so naturalistic... I'm not sure that I need that sense of the horror film, though."
6141,1,The claustrophobia is the point.
6142,1,The Humans is a thoughtful and brilliantly acted meditation on family and humanity.
6143,1,Stephen Karam clearly has an eye for directing.
6144,1,"Karam's film may not make you feel better about your family's Thanksgiving, but if nothing else, it may offer catharsis in how closely it replicates the experience."
6145,1,The actors are uniformly impeccable; none are stars and they're all perfection. This is one of the rare one-set theater pieces that has actually been enhanced and deepened through its transfer to the screen.
6146,1,"Theatre director Stephen Karam guides us through a nerve-shredding evening using sly shooting angles to throw us off balance, and into psychological discomfort, buoyed by actors who go all in."
6147,1,"Rather than wear influences on his sleeve, the first-time director has fabricated a bespoke suit out of them -- but it's still his work."
6148,1,"The Humans is either the scariest drama I've ever seen, or the least terrifying horror movie of the year. It seems to be asking the question: What if a haunted house was only a little bit haunted?"
6149,1,"This is not your warm, fuzzy Thanksgiving experience, but something very dark, bordering on being a horror film. We almost gave up on it, but the performances pulled us in, especially when it started to rev up about halfway into the film."
6150,1,"A six-person cast can be hard to pull off if there's a weak link. Luckily, there is not."
6151,1,"It plays out like cinema verité, as the plot comes through the performances of this fantastic cast and the orchestration of emotions set against the percussive noise of a New York apartment."
6152,1,The Humans explores layered & realistic family relationships in a deeply nuanced way that is elevated by strong direction and thoughtful performances.
6153,1,"Karam, who wrote the screenplay adaptation of his play, has done an excellent job here, showing restraint, keeping the action, moving both physically and emotionally, without pushing his characters into overheated reactions, or speechifying."
6154,1,An insightful and unnerving film that's intimate and unsparing in getting under the skin of its featured humans.
6155,1,"A depiction of disintegration rather than celebration, but one that's subtly written, brilliantly acted and sensitively directed and shot."
6156,1,It's a savagely sophisticated film.
6157,0,"More ambitious than the average saga about dysfunctional family holiday gatherings, this adaptation of the Tony-winning one-act play nevertheless maintains an awkward emotional detachment on screen."
6158,1,"It's part family drama, part horror movie, aka...Thanksgiving."
6159,0,"If you want to watch a family that is going to have a less fun time at Thanksgiving than you will, you can check this one out."
6160,1,"Houdyshell, who won a Tony for the same performance on Broadway, steals the film. She's supporting-actress worthy if voters take the time to peel the layers of this film."
6161,1,"The house is definitely haunted in ""The Humans,"" Stephen Karam's skillfully filmed adaptation of his Tony-winning 2016 play."
6162,1,"""The Humans"" gets a lot done in a short amount of time, in a single, two-level setting, plus a few fraught intimations of what's down the hall or around the corner."
6163,1,"The Humans, writer/director Stephen Karam's arty, melancholic screen adaptation of his Tony award-winning play, is painful in a good way; the anguish of the characters is aching and heartfelt."
6164,1,"""The Humans"" was an unsettling play. As a movie, it's flat-out terrifying."
6165,1,"This working-class family drama is otherwise effective, if not necessarily as devastating as some of its general type. The performances are all first-rate,"
6166,0,"The cast's chemistry never quite gels beyond their staged circumstances, and too much of the dialogue replicates actual life without finding a deeper resonance..."
6167,1,"Karam has translated his stage work into a film that never feels static. It lives somewhere in the genre space between indie drama and thriller, smack-dab between the surreal and the all too real."
6168,1,"It looms large in the small canon of Thanksgiving cinema, a quintessential stomachache of a movie."
6169,1,"The way it's staged and filmed intentionally replicates the atmosphere of a horror movie. You won't find an ounce of blood or a single instance of violence here, yet the act of watching the movie is nerve-rattling."
6170,1,Stephen Karam's The Humans is a fantastic work of theater. Is it a good movie? Well. It's a fantastic work of theater.
6171,1,"Karam is too honest to offer closing palliatives to his characters or his audience. But when he plunges us into darkness here, as decisively as he did onstage, he does so with all the more bracing certainty that the lights will come up."
6172,1,One of the eeriest family comedies ever made.
6173,1,"it's spellbinding, provocative and haunting. If you like your holiday movies bold, profound, haunting and refreshingly un-Hollywood, The Humans would be right up your alley."
6174,1,"Karam's adaptation of his own Tony-winning drama keeps everything focused, steady and steely."
6175,1,"As its lights dim into darkness and its cacophony of building noises rise up, The Humans poses as a survivor's journey....Karam offers a absorbing approach to how the dead continue to haunt us."
6176,1,"...for those patient enough to stick with it, they'll be rewarded with one of the more unique and high-brow haunted house films that you'll ever come across."
6177,1,"The Humans will keep viewers guessing on what terrible things might happen at an often-uncomfortable family reunion during Thanksgiving. It's not a horror movie, but it's a well-acted study of psychological turmoil."
6178,1,"As a family drama, The Humans is complicated and rewarding. But like its protagonists, the film really doesn't feel comfortable in its own skin, creating an experience that is confounding and frustrating, pulling the audience in the wrong direction."
6179,1,[W]riter/director Stephen Karam transforms this mostly typical domestic drama into a horror show waiting to unfold.
6180,1,"Karam lays on the surreal unease too heavily at times, but the actors come to his rescue again and again, creating a terribly moving portrait of an American family as the lights go out one by one."
6181,1,"Jayne Houdyshell, in the role that won her a Tony on Broadway, is the standout in an ensemble that includes Amy Schumer, Richard Jenkins and Beanie Feldstein."
6182,1,"Hitting the screen just as we are happy (or not) about seeing family for Thanksgiving, this complicated drama is timely and boosted by its all-star cast."
6183,1,"This adaptation isn't likely to entertain teens or most adults, but there are still elements that deserve praise."
6184,1,"Had I not seen the play, I may not have fully registered how ingeniously Karam has used the freedom of film to open up and underscore his already powerful material."
6185,1,It's the feel-bad entertainment that Thanksgiving deserves.
6186,1,"It's not without its narrative stumbles, yet it's still impressive to see how Scott can return to the franchise and show how he is happy to challenge himself by exploring new avenues as opposed to resting on his laurels."
6187,1,"Prometheus asks a lot of questions that it refuses to answer, but if you're wiling to go along this philosophical ride there's plenty to enjoy."
6188,1,"Ambitious to a fault, Scott's return to the beloved franchise is as philosophical as it is messy. Smart scientists make dumb decisions, yes, but the film is gorgeous, intriguing in its heady ideas, and features a solid Ripley combo in Vickers & Shaw"
6189,1,"At its most ambitious, 'Prometheus' plants suggestions of the extraterrestrial origins of life on Earth, a Godlike race sowing genetic seeds across galaxy, and even an Old Testament-like sense of retribution..."
6190,0,"The flaws in the screenplay undo even Ridley Scott’s profound level of visual brilliance, which is on considerable display here."
6191,1,"It’s a visual delight with a story that delivers genuine intensity, some great characters, and an ending that had me howling for more."
6192,1,An Alien story without Xenomorphs allows Prometheus to explore the horrors beyond and within our galaxy.
6193,1,"You can see the film that could have been made off somewhere in the distance, but you cannot reach it because somebody built this replacement in its way."
6194,1,"The ideas are big, bold and brutal."
6195,1,Dazzles from start to finish.
6196,0,A mess of unresolved ideas and poorly defined beings.
6197,1,A beautiful film to behold.
6198,1,"It is as if it were a science fiction theory that bets on an ingenious and interesting mythology, but at the same time, enigmatic. [Full review in Spanish]"
6199,1,"The ultimate effectiveness of Prometheus for individual viewers will most likely come down to whether the film carries them away to new places, as it did for me..."
6200,0,"Ridley Scott's return to the universe of ALIEN is slightly undone by blockbuster movie logic and a rather shonky, at times appalling, script."
6201,0,"Overall, Prometheus is enjoyable as a summer blockbuster but it does not offer enough to compliment the Alien franchise."
6202,1,"So is this the film of the year? My epiphany in the cinema? No, because ""Prometheus"" is not exactly flawless. There are some crazy stupid moments in the film."
6203,0,"Between the trippy visuals and strong characters, Scott spins an engrossing yarn. But the story is as messy and convoluted as the serpentine creatures that inevitably uncoil from the alien crypt."
6204,1,"A fascinating journey, to be sure, but its mix of big ideas with horror and suspense never quite meshes together."
6205,1,A magical bit of science fiction that Scott uses to start widening the world he began in 1979 with Alien.
6206,1,This is a well-crafted piece of work that astutely balances science fiction with some genuinely jump-out-of-your-seat moments. It's a throwback that should please fans of the sci-fi genre.
6207,1,"Prometheus is a hard one to judge, despite what people had been telling me for years, it's actually not that bad... nor is it that great either. Average it is then!"
6208,1,"Even when its reach doesn't quite meet its grasp, it still deserves to be seen."
6209,1,The plot has a lot of very intriguing concepts and the writers and Scott have come up with a myriad of ways to organically integrate much of the beloved Alien iconography while still forging glorious new images.
6210,0,Fans of Scott's previous sci-fi efforts will be desperately disappointed to discover a film which promises an innumerable degree of far more enticing themes and ideas than it can ultimately deliver.
6211,1,"Played with an understated sense of humor by Fassbender, [David's] one of the most entrancing creations on the big screen this year."
6212,1,"This movie is smart, suspenseful and at times, even funny-and the acting is impeccable."
6213,0,"Prometheus is one of those big ruined films that are worth talking about in terms of how it got ruined, and how it might've been saved."
6214,1,"The film is first and foremost a well-made, immersive piece of sci-fi/horror that serves as a perfect addition to Scott's other black space classic."
6215,1,"Viewers with short attention spans probably won't enjoy the gradual build Scott does so well, but it's worth the wait."
6216,1,The passage of time brings [Ridley Scott] back to the genre with the questions of a man facing his mortality-and with the tricks of a showman who hasn't forgotten how to scare you.
6217,1,"Despite its flaws, Prometheus is a visually stunning film (well worth the extra expense of 3-D) that leaves the viewer pondering its themes of creation's longing to know its creator long after the credits have rolled."
6218,1,"What is absolutely guaranteed, however, is that Prometheus will entertain you. It's a damn good ride, and it will, occasionally, make you think."
6219,1,"Director Ridley Scott is returning to his roots here, making the kind of atmospheric horror that builds up to its scare through judicious use of music, lighting and setting to set moods, and then punctuating scenes with explosive, frightening violence."
6220,1,"Prometheus recaptures the essence of not only a beloved franchise, but also an admired yet complicated genre many filmmakers attempt but few successfully. In short, it shows the amateurs how it's really done."
6221,1,A movie like Prometheus-and that is the extraordinary power of its genre-serves as an outlet for irrational connections.
6222,0,It leads you expect much more than is actually delivered.
6223,1,"Scott's long-awaited return to science fiction is equal parts wondrous, frustrating and flawed."
6224,1,"Even if the movie's logic ultimately spirals down into a vortex of hysteria, horror and hokum, I enjoyed the bulldozer intensity of the climax, which barely keeps a lid on the crackpot cult movie that's wrestling for the soul of this... blockbuster."
6225,1,"Prometheus is a mesmerising collision of theological angst, going further than Alien in beating on HP Lovecraft's tentacle doorknocker."
6226,0,"Prometheus is so visually ravishing with stunning special effects... But the characterizations are thin and one-note, leaving most of its talented cast members without much interesting to say or do before they get [killed]."
6227,1,"Prometheus is undeniably gorgeous. It's hard to imagine anything looking better, especially with its brilliant 3-D that's well worth the upsell."
6228,1,"With poise and great artistry, Scott crafts a world that combines high-tech science, primal beginnings, human frailty and sheer horror."
6229,0,The story is a lurching carnival of budget blasts.
6230,0,"Scott tries not to remake Alien and attempts instead a mini-Kubrick, a muddled Tarkovsky, perhaps an Asimov, or even the recently-departed Bradbury. But old habits, and slimy beings, die hard."
6231,0,"The best-looking stupid movie I've seen all year. It's sumptuously photographed, and often inane."
6232,1,"Many walked into this movie expecting a science fiction thriller in the vein of Ridley Scott's original Alien. This, I feel, was a colossal mistake."
6233,1,"It is easily the most cerebral endeavor of its kind since ""Minority Report."""
6234,0,Prometheus is scary only in the sum of instincts and talent for movie-making that have been lost.
6235,1,Any lack in originality is handsomely compensated by the plethora of 3D visual treats courtesy of a crackerjack technical crew that creates an eerie interplanetary moonscape that's as epic as it is requisitely foreboding.
6236,1,"WPrometheus offers hypotheses about the origin of life on our planet that are so well constructed, they make real-life theories about extraterrestrials seem highly feasible."
6237,1,"The mishmash of grotesque body-horror and chin-stroking existentialism does not always make for the most coherent movie, but it is at least an entertaining one and certainly no black mark on the franchise."
6238,1,"Rather than trying to reinvent the franchise with new tricks, ""Prometheus"" wants to return us to that uncertain terror that loomed over the 1979 original."
6239,0,"Prometheus, as both a response to Alien and its own attempts at philosophical and spiritual investigations, ended up filling in holes that simply were not mandatory to have filled."
6240,1,"The movie wasn't giving my brain much of a workout, but my eyes got a nice buzz. ""Prometheus"" is straight-up gorgeous..."
6241,1,"Insulting lip service to 2001 notwithstanding, Prometheus shocks and awes with more than sufficient technical bravura. If only it was as smart as it clearly thinks it is."
6242,1,"Artfully designed with special effects that border on the elegant-there's no other way to put it-""Prometheus"" is a visual delight."
6243,1,"There's a lot of college dorm philosophical mumbo jumbo on top but it all really boils down to, ""Man seeks his creator/makes contact/discovers he is a total jerk."""
6244,1,"Prometheus is a welcome return to form for Ridley Scott -- delivering a fascinating sci-fi storyline, gorgeous 3D visuals, and competent filmmaking choices."
6245,1,"Very few films can create a genuine sense of wonder and discovery, and Prometheus manages it for its entire 124 minute running time ... almost entirely a sensory experience."
6246,1,"Never quite matching Alien or Aliens for emotional authenticity - but definitely holding you in tow until the final moments. Ridley Scott isn't much for illustrating humanity, but he sure as hell knows how to craft aliens."
6247,1,"Prometheus might have given serous thought to this premise, but it opts instead for strenuous action. Still, the film has glimmerings of intelligence."
6248,1,"It isn't perfect, but Prometheus is a thoroughly entertaining summer blockbuster that is a cut above the rest due to an amazing cast and Ridley Scott, who re-establishes himself as one of our greatest world building filmmakers."
6249,0,"The film [has] a kind of ""been there, done that"" feeling."
6250,1,"Returning to the genre that skyrocketed his career with ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" Scott has fashioned a fascinating new mystery within his original ""Alien"" universe."
6251,1,Scott has lensed a film that possesses the look of a video View-Master. It's jaw-droppingly striking.
6252,1,"I won't say that I'm con-metheus, but I'm not entirely pro-metheus either."
6253,1,"An excellent film, but not quite the genre-redefining, mind-blowing, life-changing experience much of the hype suggests."
6254,0,"In space, everyone can hear you try too hard."
6255,1,Scott has indeed created another sci-fi classic -- brilliant mess that it is.
6256,1,"""Prometheus"" comes off as a really fun movie with knockout effects, a splendid visual design, tense scenes, a playful attitude but ... well, it's a wee bit familiar."
6257,1,Ridley Scott retells an old story
6258,0,"After a stunning opening, Scott fails to close the deal"
6259,1,"Prometheus asks a big, loaded question, but teasingly leaves the answer for another mission...and another movie."
6260,1,"For those who aren't opposed to a little 'Why?' in their sci-fi, Ridley offers a penetrating other-worldly adventure like few films in recent memory."
6261,0,"Ridley Scott's long-awaited prequel-of-sorts to his game-changing 1979 classic sci-fi terror ride Alien is not only conceptually lame and badly made, it's actually worse than Alien Resurrection."
6262,1,"Let's get this straight: 'Prometheus' is not a direct prequel to 'Alien,' 'Aliens' or 'Predator.' However, 'Prometheus' does exist in that particular universe."
6263,1,"The movie may be a scare show that leaves many questions unanswered, but Scott's craft earns an exhausted kind of respect."
6264,1,The production design by Arthur Max and the art direction of the film are spectacular. It is an awesome feat of visual art.
6265,0,They would have been better off channeling their inner Ellen Ripley and pulling the release to the airlock before this voyage departed.
6266,1,"While I was completely engrossed in 'Prometheus', I felt a tug-of-war going on between the cerebral and visceral elements, right up to the finale."
6267,1,With a few perfectly pitched sequences of sheer terror -- capped by an astonishing surgery scene featuring Rapace -- Scott coils the tension to unbearable tightness.
6268,0,"Scott was so intent on returning his spawn to glory that he mistakenly shot for Alien by way of 2001: A Space Odyssey, making it all the more disappointing when he inevitably settled for Aliens by way of Lost in Space."
6269,1,"The movie has good acting and a great look, but the plot is confusing and eventually not as interesting as it should be."
6270,1,"'Prometheus' could be starting something great. While it looks amazing, the jury is out on whether it ends up reminding me of 'The Matrix Reloaded' more than anything else."
6271,1,"a would-be summer blockbuster of intense ambition and visual grandeur, merging metaphysical speculation with healthy doses of gooey-horrific imagery and high-tension suspense"
6272,0,"Starts out intriguingly as an exploration of faith and humankind's origins. To my disappointment, though, it largely abandons this once the familiar face-huggers and chest-bursters start to appear."
6273,1,It's a striking composition that's burdened by frustrating unanswered questions that distract from the greater themes of faith and religion in science.
6274,0,It's a gutsy effort but the screenplay from Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof isn't strong enough. I was struggling with the characters from the very beginning.
6275,0,"It's not necessarily a bad movie, it's just half of a great one. And that's almost more disappointing."
6276,1,"For all its grand designs and sweeping vistas, Prometheus could simply do with a bit more story."
6277,0,It's like going to the Dalai Lama with a question only for him to answer you with a question.
6278,1,"If this film wasn't burdened with having to serve as a prequel to the 'Alien' series, it would be much stronger overall."
6279,1,"The premise that creatures from outer space ""engineered"" human life on earth is loaded with cautionary baggage. For one thing, it screams FICTION and FANTASY in a context that strives for the appearance of realism."
6280,0,"""Alien"" had great characters, unrivaled shocks and a claustrophobic atmosphere. Prometheus ... looks great!"
6281,1,"Often good and sometimes bad and occasionally horrendous as a narrative, but it is never, ever, less than a stone-cold masterpiece of design and world-building."
6282,1,"...a smart, ambitious, and, admittedly, erratically-paced blockbuster that does seem as though it'd benefit from repeat viewings (as well as a more complete picture promised by inevitable followups)."
6283,1,"""Prometheus"" is a cinematic masterpiece with beautifully haunting visuals and an epic score. Instead of spoon-feeding the audience, Scott allows you to think for yourself!"
6284,1,"A hot mess of a screenplay, but extraordinarily ambitious and boasts Ridley Scott's usual arresting visuals."
6285,0,Crushed under the weight of its own pretentious ideas.
6286,1,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is beautifully chaotic, wonderfully weird, and one of the coolest movies ever made."
6287,1,The Daniels accomplished something wonderful for the audience.
6288,1,"Michelle Yeoh finally gets a role this decade that pays tribute to her rare talents, and absolutely owns it..."
6289,1,The genre mashup provides a fuller insight into the characters’ personalities than a straight independent film could depict. The multiverse is a metaphor for the different facets of peoples’ potential and makes their internal lives literal.
6290,1,"Everything Everywhere All at Once will remind you of why you love cinema. It is fresh, creative, and will leave you laughing and shedding some tears."
6291,1,An omnipotent being is threatening the multiverse. Who ya gonna call? Spiderman? Dr. Strange? How about a middle-aged Asian-American woman failing as a wife and mother?
6292,1,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the greatest films of all time. Entertaining, hilarious, emotional, wild, unique, action packed, & INSANE"
6293,1,"At the heart of it all, we ride a roller coaster of emotions that are inventive, complex, stimulating, and raw."
6294,1,"With such a low budget, it's almost humiliating that so many expensive Hollywood blockbusters can't even reach the heels of so much originality, imagination, excitement, and emotion."
6295,1,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a spectacle in the purest sense of the word. A sensory overload, especially in IMAX, the movie is a science fiction, multi-verse spanning love letter to family."
6296,1,Delightfully disorienting and intellectually absorbing.
6297,0,"""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" is a steaming example of visual, sonic, and thematic noise. Chinese propaganda for propaganda's sake. Vomiting all of the time now. Hollywood pawns."
6298,1,"At a few minutes short of two and a half hours, Everything Everywhere All at Once nearly wears out its welcome, but as far as hot dog-fingered audacity goes, the Daniels will make plenty of new eyeballs go googly."
6299,1,"... Touches upon important themes such as control through technology, media, food, and body while resorting to an anarchic and hilarious sense of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
6300,0,"The filmmakers try to load the entire weight of life, the universe, and everything onto their movie. This is too many things on a bagel."
6301,1,"Michelle Yeoh proves that being a middle aged immigrant has no boundaries and she is backed up with the amazingly gifted talents of Ke Huy Quan, Jaime Lee Curtis and Stephanie Hsu !  The Daniels provide a supreme sci-fi smorgasbord for the ages."
6302,0,"It holds within it a great idea, when one disentangles it from the hairball that is the EEAAO narrative. But [...] in all its originality, it telegraphs its message, instead of allowing this intricately constructed ingenious world to be the message."
6303,0,"The humor, though, is silly and second-rate. The googly eyes, the talking raccoon, the pet rocks at sunset, the parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey—all those work against the cast instead of with it."
6304,1,"Much like a hallucinogen might cause you to cycle through every human emotion and see your life laid out end to end — theoretically — this film has an ability to dazzle built into every kinetic, colorful, madcap frame."
6305,0,"... This victorious though regrettable film, or whatever it is, is an incomprehensible mess, foolishly imaginative and cumbersome to watch and listen to. [Full review in Spanish]"
6306,1,"... their Best Original Screenplay fuses science fiction, action, comedy, and family drama all at once. Genre jumping might be a better term to describe the Daniels’ creative mode of filmmaking."
6307,1,Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert not only think outside the box but outside the multiverse as well.
6308,0,"EEAAO is that insufferable child whose parents trot her out in tap shoes, then watch to make sure you register adequate amazement at her Buffalo turns and Bombershays. You appreciate the kid’s skill and preparation — but gawd, how you wish it were over."
6309,1,"It's a challenging, provocative, manic, self-indulgent movie."
6310,1,"Raising an ecstatic hot dog middle finger to the negativity of modern times, “EEAAO” urges us to free our minds and accept that it’s OK to be strange."
6311,1,"The fight between good and evil, right and wrong, social boundaries, mental perceptions and a long list of etc.; will take place among washing machines and calculators (...) everything, everywhere, all at once. [Full Review in Spanish]"
6312,1,"The Daniels turn in a joyous film, a party so demanding as it is exhilarating.    [Full review in Spanish]"
6313,0,"Laundry, taxes and life"
6314,0,Some seem to believe this movie is a philosophical masterpiece because characters reach conclusions such as: “nothing matters”.
6315,1,"...is certainly unique. Exploring the idea of family, existential crises, and other obvious philosophical concepts, the film uses its quasi-futuristic narrative to delve into these topics in ways not often seen in film."
6316,1,"Family is complicated, messy, difficult to understand, and what matters most in this fantastic multiverse psychedelic drama that at this point needs little introduction..."
6317,1,"[Gives] us dildo fights, raccoon chefs, hot-dog hands, and muscular pinky fingers. In one of the film's best action scenes, [we have] a fanny pack. [Elsewhere,] two rocks with googly eyes share their deepest fears and comfort each other."
6318,1,"A wonderfully weird, exhilaratingly all-over-the-place absurdist comedy, led by great performances and a screenplay that is as funny as it is moving."
6319,1,Everything Everywhere All at Once is a film with just as many lives as we see Yeoh’s Evelyn Quan Wang wade through.
6320,1,"A fun, frantic but unexpectedly emotional watch."
6321,1,"Everything Everywhere All At Once is a marvelous achievement in filmmaking. The Daniels have created one of the best films of the year, and it is sure to inspire the next generation of filmmakers."
6322,1,Michelle delivered the performance of the year in Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert's Everything Everywhere All At Once...
6323,0,"Visually restless, thematically redundant and the rare movie to be both overwhelming and underwhelming. After only a little while, you’ll desperately long to be simply whelmed."
6324,1,Everything Everywhere All at Once takes the poignant themes of parental disappointment and life regrets and is able to successfully wrap them up in an absurd and entertaining 2+ hours of craziness.
6325,1,"Lots of movies and shows entered the multiverse this year, but there was nothing remotely like this one"
6326,1,"Rarely has a film’s title reflected its contents so well. While may not include everything all at once, it does boasts a range of genre approaches stacked on top of one another and blended into a variety of combinations."
6327,1,"A true genre-bending wonder with phenomenal performances from the entire cast, stunning visuals, and powerful themes, the hype behind Everything Everywhere All At Once is real!"
6328,1,I hope this movie exists in every alternate universe.
6329,1,"An exhausting, confusing, hilariously funny, pleasing assault on the ears and eyes from directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert."
6330,1,"Never has a film lived up to its title more than this, the most bonkers movie you’ll ever see, equal parts exhilarating and exhausting. I remain leary of the multiverse trend of chaotic storytelling. It shouldn't be repeated. Let “EEAAO” exist on its own."
6331,1,"...mixes science fiction, martial arts, comedy, fantasy, parody, animation, social realism, and probably a few more styles I’ve left out."
6332,1,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is one of the best films this year. From the editing, set design, world building, pacing/transitions, amazing student choreography and some of the best performances this year from Yeoh, Quan, & Hsu. A NEAR PERFECT FILM!"
6333,1,Undoubtedly the most creatively chaotic experience I’ve ever seen or likely will ever see.
6334,1,It's the most original film of the year
6335,1,EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE is one of the best films of the year. It’s a brave cinematic mirror of all the banal but critical things that make us and our lives important in an indifferent universe.
6336,1,"Stephanie Hsu threw down one of the best performances of 2022, hands down."
6337,1,"Delightfully bonkers on the surface, this inventive extravaganza from the directing team called Daniels (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert) has a deep layer of family feeling and a well-earned emotional pull at the end."
6338,1,The most brilliantly bananas movie of 2022 absolutely lives up to its title. Michelle Yeoh kicks all types of butt as a time-travelling laundromat manager in a multiverse of madness.
6339,1,It’s an apt title—Everything Everywhere All At Once really does have everything...
6340,1,(The Daniels) Kwan and Scheinert make everything seem possible.
6341,1,"The explosion of creative storytelling along with stellar performances by the gifted ensemble led by the incandescent Michelle Yeoh, make for a dense work that should be revisited to continue to peel away the legion of layers that can be found..."
6342,1,Everything Everywhere All at Once is everything you want from a movie and so much more.
6343,1,…and in the multiverse Michelle Yeoh is everything!
6344,1,"The directing duo, Daniels, turned down a Marvel offer to make their delightful new movie. We couldn't be happier."
6345,1,"I can't promise everyone will like it, because it is so weird. But it's so unique I feel like everybody should give it a shot."
6346,1,I've always been a fan of Michelle Yeoh and this was a fantastic showcase of her skills. I really liked this movie and was thoroughly entertained. The only negative is that visually it can be VERY overwhelming.
6347,1,I greatly enjoyed this and look forward to seeing it multiple times to continue dissecting the visuals and themes. All of the actors brought their A-game and I hope this gets numerous accolades this awards season.
6348,1,"It is unafraid of being cheesy and silly, leaning into the full potential of its marvelous vulgarity cut with a prevailing sweetness that resonates in a triumphant final act."
6349,1,"The Daniels, through their quirky, revolutionary and thoroughly entertaining film, offer a winning perspective to our troubles: It all matters exactly because we’re small and stupid."
6350,1,"A peerless ode to love, life and everything in between."
6351,1,"One of the most profound and moving sci-fi films I’ve ever seen, as well as being mental and a lot of fun."
6352,1,Everything Everywhere All At Once is the reason I still go to the movies! We've got a good one here folks.
6353,1,"The performances are in perfect sync with the Daniels’ giddiness. Michelle Yeoh, at the front and centre of possibly the most memorable role of her career, is the anchor of a film that rarely stops once it gets going."
6354,1,Everything Everywhere All at Once is an exhilarating ride and an ample showcase of rising and unrealised talent that embodies the beauty of the human spirit through the prism of the preternatural. It is one of the best films of 2022.
6355,1,Michelle Yeoh pulls off what is arguably the best performance of her storied screen career.
6356,1,Everything Everywhere All at Once takes a creative look at familiar topics by way of the multiverse concept.
6357,1,"Exhilarating, funny and moving, their film is also messy, overstuffed and a trifle exhausting."
6358,1,"Some of it is legitimately moving, and gets at the specific pains of an Asian-American family in a more lateral and artistic way than it might have with a more conventional narrative."
6359,1,"Everything Everywhere All at Once is simply one of the best films of the year. Cinematically brilliant, full of nuanced performances and with incredible themes throughout.   A24 continues to showcase why it stands as one of the best film studios."
6360,0,"Whether it’s the draining exposition of the first half or the smothering non-stop ridiculousness of the second half, the film never finds a good balance."
6361,1,"It’s absurd and wild and wonderful, and will probably make you cry."
6362,0,"...the undisciplined product of a pair of spitballing concept artists, who too often find themselves pitching out of hiccups in characterization and allegory and embracing the shiny allure of the new whenever nuance become too much to bear..."
6363,1,"It's smart, idiotic, serious, hilarious, sentimental, routinary, fantastic, complex, simple, easy, hard; it's done it. It's everything. At once. Everywhere. [Full review in Spanish]"
6364,1,"Hyper-innovative thrill-ride... draws elements of science fiction, martial arts, family values and that ever-expanding storytelling device known as the multiverse, and then throws the whole lot in a blender."
6365,1,"It’s up there with Mad Max: Fury Road, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Matrix, in that it’s a movie that fully embraces the spectacle and artistry of cinema whilst never forgetting about what really matters: story, character, and theme."
6366,1,"A bit overrated but worth seeing for the great Michelle Yeoh in a very trendy, nth-degree multi-verse, live-action cartoon concept film. (Lionsgate 4K blu-ray)."
6367,1,"Collaborating with a small team of visual effects artists working in practical media, [Daniels] have achieved a joyous spectacle as exhausting as it is constantly surprising. ... For all of its imagination, this movie's finale feels overlong and preachy."
6368,1,This is a film about finding love and connection when you’ve been ground down. Even the bizarre hot dog-handed world gets to have its own deep moments that will likely make you cry.
6369,1,The sort of movie Michelle Yeoh deserves.
6370,1,"Outrageous, confusing, or confounding? Everything Everywhere All at Once stands out as one of the most original movies to come along in years."
6371,1,"Everything Everywhere All At Once can be compared to many, many things, but one of the most complimentary things I can say about any movie is that this one felt like a live-action Don Hertzfeldt film."
6372,1,"A phantasmagorical time-shifting multiverse explosion of kung-fu sci-fi. Chaos reigns supreme, with the screen ablaze with every trick in a director’s arsenal, like an immersive demo of sensory overload."
6373,1,"It's a whirl, a swirl, a trip, a blast and a juggle as well and, in this universe, the Daniels wouldn't have it any other way."
6374,1,This is the true virtue that catapults this film into an instant classic: It finds beauty in the ordinary. [Full review in Spanish]
6375,1,"After maybe, 10-15 minutes of normal stuff -- taxes, laundry, family tensions -- this movie takes off into some of the most imaginative and just plain what-tha’-??????? territory you’ve ever seen."
6376,1,"Not the perfect movie they've been hyping about, but a visually stunning feature with Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan at the top of their game. An interesting story about embracing the uncertainty of our own destiny. Twenty minutes too long IMO."
6377,1,"...in Everything Everywhere All at Once, we enter the universes, the many branches of the central character, Evelyn Wang..."
6378,1,"It makes good use of the idea of a multiverse, showing us the different possibilities of its protagonists, and confidently developing a narrative centred on the relationship between a mother and daughter, and a wife and husband. Full review in Spanish."
6379,0,"I can't find anything out of the ordinary, except a boredom that is as infinite as the universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
6380,1,"Here's what's truly bold about Everything Everywhere All at Once: it doesn't try to be all things to all people. It's a keeper, in any universe."
6381,1,"The colorful thriller, Everything Everywhere All At Once, is a movie to watch when nothing in the world makes sense anymore because it reminds you of what it is to be human. [Full review in Spanish]"
6382,1,Utilizes science fiction as a vehicle to approach its philosophical questions...or something more intimate like new ways to solve problems or accompany your family on the path that each one chooses. [Full review in Spanish]
6383,1,"Almost, almost multiplies exponentially. [Full review in Spanish]"
6384,1,There are moments when the title seems too literal. Exhaustion creeps in. But successive second winds follow.
6385,1,"Places the adventure in introspective terrain, almost metaphysical. [Full review in Spanish]"
6386,1,"Just because it proves more of an entertaining romp than political satire, though, doesn't mean the latter won't resonate. Think a grounded SORRY TO BOTHER."
6387,1,"It’s really the subplots that should get your brain turning. Chief among them is the film’s exploration of some Black folks’ adherence to conspiracy theories, no matter how outlandish."
6388,1,Juel Taylor's debut film combines humor and science fiction with a harsh condemnation of contemporary American society. [Full review in Spanish]
6389,1,"They Cloned Tyrone is a wonderful experience of a movie with a completely original story, told with style and flair, with performances that blow the roof off."
6390,1,"A delightfully smart, outrageously inventive social satire that evokes films like They Live and Get Out, They Cloned Tyrone is a headrush of powerful ideas, astute characterization and incredibly witty homage to the Blaxploitation movement of the 1970s."
6391,1,... has a lot of personality for a copycat.
6392,1,They Cloned Tyrone has one of Jamie Foxx's best performances in years. We get the rare moment when Jamie is not afraid to go stupid.
6393,1,Along with similarly out-there and socially conscious genre experimentations by Black filmmakers [...] Taylor’s film has many antecedents but adopts a tone that feels wholly innovative.
6394,1,"This movie is a social commentary that really holds up a mirror to society in both hilarious, and, at times, harrowing ways."
6395,1,"They Cloned Tyrone was quite good!  With homages to Truman Show and Groundhog Day, the film is great mix of sci-fi, dystopian comedy, and dark satire. A unique lens on exploitation.  Strong performances by John Boyega Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris."
6396,1,"Given all the ideas, Taylor’s genre platter ends with a satisfying and thought-provoking fantasy note."
6397,1,"Far from bad, but does require patience."
6398,1,"It's funny, suspenseful and a great watch! Very unique storytelling that pays off. I highly recommend!"
6399,1,"This was firing on all cylinders! Fantastic performances, writing, cinematography and music! One of the best films of the year...hands down!"
6400,1,"The lack of subtlety works in They Cloned Tyrone’s favor, just as it worked in the favor of They Live! or Pootie Tang or Sorry to Bother You."
6401,1,"It does waver at times, but the laughs are always backed by insightful ideas."
6402,1,First-time film-maker Taylor’s conspiracy caper is an imaginative piece of storytelling -- no clone here -- that surprises right until the closing punchline.
6403,1,Juel's directorial debut deserves commendation for breaking stereotypes and showcasing his formidable talent.
6404,1,Boyega has to play the film's moral fortitude and does it well but Jamie Foxx and Teyonah Parris give two of the best comic performances of the year and are an absolute delight to watch bounce off each other.
6405,1,"Even though it's shot like a Blaxploitation film, at no time does the scope of the film not feel grand. It's a horror/sci-fi film with social commentary that doesn't feel too woke that it takes you out of the pure enjoyment of the film."
6406,1,They Cloned Tyrone is almost too good for its Netflix home. What Taylor delivered for his debut is something of cinematic value.
6407,1,The fact that it can bring so many past favorites to mind while still maintaining its own identity is a feat unto itself.
6408,1,"This movie is so fun, so joyful in its plunge into a stylized Black cultural world that mixes nostalgia for the bad old Blaxploitation days and hypercontemporary references, that you almost don’t notice how much Afropessimism is in its DNA."
6409,1,"Juel Taylor knows how to deliver a personal, original and fun film. [Full review in Spanish]"
6410,1,Ambiguity filters the lines between the truth and fantasy.
6411,1,"The mystery can be hard to follow for the first half hour, but if you can stick with it, it really picks up in the second half with a villainous monologue that explains what's going on, a mix of ""Body Snatchers,"" ""Get Out,"" ""Us"" and ""Sorry to Bother You."""
6412,1,The actors have a whale of a time in this smartly subversive sci-fi thriller comedy.
6413,1,"If you like mystery movies that have an element of humour behind them and want to watch one that's totally off the wall, check this out."
6414,1,"Though it doesn't hit all its marks (especially when the plot-oriented second half writes itself into a few illogical corners), They Cloned Tyrone never relinquishes its equally alluring and off-putting charm."
6415,1,"This is a thoughtful and hilarious, if raw and at times profane, sci-fi mystery comedy."
6416,1,Director Juel Taylor’s debut feature is a slick and stylish celebration of the Blaxploitation genre and the Black culture that gave birth to it.
6417,1,Jamie Foxx delivers a hysterical performance in Netflix's wildly entertaining genre mashup that combines goofy comedy with sharp satire.
6418,1,"With one of the best soundtracks of the year, which includes a title track performed by Erykah Badu, They Cloned Tyrone is a weird, funny, surreal ride that will have you thinking as much as laughing."
6419,1,"They Cloned Tyrone is an offbeat paranoia thriller that plays with stereotypes, comments on society, and does so with plenty of skill."
6420,1,"A daring genre-blending feature directorial debut from Juel Taylor, They Cloned Tyrone is a worthwhile watch."
6421,1,"They Cloned Tyrone is at least a great conversation starter, hopefully, an Oscar-Nomination for Jamie Foxx, and a true science fiction film that can go beyond what is on the surface."
6422,1,"They Cloned Tyrone falls apart slightly in the last half-hour and a harsher hand in the edit suite might have made the film even better. But this is still an unexpected pile of dark, goofy, satiric fun."
6423,1,"His [Juel Taylor] is a richly imagined and visually impressive world, and the laugh-out-loud screenplay he and Tony Rettenmaier wrote fires off joke after joke while paying homage to blaxploitation films of yore."
6424,1,"“Tyrone” appears to be saying something very broad and belabored about the plight of the Black community. It, unintentionally or not, paints a picture of a monolithic culture warped by outside influences."
6425,1,"Without pretensions or gravitas, the film takes on racial criticism displaying a '70s Neo Noir aesthetic, with opaque colors and shadows, and a humor that combines social satire with the absurd. [Full review in Spanish]"
6426,1,I think it's more interesting to talk about.
6427,1,There’s a thread of something quite revolutionary at play in They Cloned Tyrone.
6428,1,"Taylor proves to be a promising new talent with They Cloned Tyrone, an imperfect but nevertheless intoxicatingly peculiar farce/thriller/satire/Scooby-Doo-ass mystery that’s very much a must-see."
6429,1,"Wildly funny, They Cloned Tyrone’s satirical unpacking of the Black community’s cornerstones – food, music and religion – thrillingly tackles the uncomfortable idea that outsiders gain more from these institutions than the Black community itself."
6430,1,"They Cloned Tyrone stands out for its ingenious and innovative synergy of genres, where the acting prowess of its protagonists blends with social issues, addressed in an entertaining way and with a touch of humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
6431,1,"It’s Boyega who drives home the dual nature of Taylor’s film. They Cloned Tyrone is funny, yes. It’s stylish, certainly. But there’s a real streak of despair here that the actor captures in every earnest, angry scene of Fontaine alone in his helplessness."
6432,1,... A huge and daring movie.
6433,1,"The offbeat science-fiction comedy They Cloned Tyrone has a high-concept premise, delivered with a distinctively skewed, slapstick-esque comic rhythm."
6434,1,"A paranoid good time, but it also carries more importance than one might initially suspect. It contributes in many ways to an ongoing growth of Black American cinema that tackles challenging issues while proving it can be done so as slick entertainment."
6435,1,"While it's made to a high standard, the storytelling is more than a little chaotic. But the central themes are urgent and pungent, and moments of insight stop us in our tracks."
6436,0,"... The satirical component is always behind the mystery the protagonists are trying to solve. But then it skews towards a thriller without renouncing what it has already established, and that hybrid never comes to fruition. [Full review in Spanish]"
6437,1,"Loads of fun blending sci-fi, horror, and comedy while shelling out a healthy dose of social commentary. John Boyega is great, Teyonah Parris is charming and entertaining, and Jamie Foxx is the film’s VIP providing the best one-liners and laughs."
6438,1,"Tylor laughs at stereotypes and along with Rettenmaier, they weave an entertaining plot that every so often fires out social critiques. [Full review in Spanish]"
6439,1,"Unsurprisingly, an uneven tone is the main issue with the ambitious and fitfully entertaining first self-directed feature from Creed II screenwriter Juel Taylor."
6440,1,The energy is nothing if not vital. Foxx has a blast; Boyega is sturdy. Best of all is Parris... bouncing off her co-stars and making her own space in the film.
6441,1,"In Juel Taylor’s directorial debut, They Cloned Tyrone, he’s crafted a modern blaxploitation film that is funny and entertaining, yet thought provoking enough that will stay with you after the credits roll."
6442,1,"This is a stylistic mystery that implements a few sci-fi twists to make for an entertaining ride. While the story begins to lose its way with so many ideas, the commentary is handled well throughout. This trio is great together, and Boyega shines."
6443,1,"In his debut, Taylor has established himself as an inventive cinematic voice. I look forward to watching how well his skill set develops with each new project."
6444,1,"A Nancy Drew-inspired hooker (the terrific Teyonah Parris), 1995's 'Pimp of the Year' (Jamie Foxx), and a drug dealer (John Boyega) everyone thought had been gunned down walk into an elevator, and some dialogue-driven hilarity ensues. (mini-review)"
6445,0,"Simply put, “They Cloned Tyrone” has a good set-up, but the film is too sketchy and conceptual to work as a bad-dream thriller. Yet it establishes Jule Taylor as a director of craft and a certain audacious nerve."
6446,1,a science fiction comedy dressed up as Blaxploitation with a new social commentary and a fresh way of delivering it.
6447,1,They Cloned Tyrone is one of the best films of 2023...This thrilling modern-day blaxploitation satire succeeds in weaving multiple through-provoking themes into its story.
6448,1,"Something about They Cloned Tyrone pops, both visually and thematically."
6449,0,"It drags on, frankly. I think it could've used to be 20 minutes shorter."
6450,0,"The three actors are fun to watch, but it was spinning its wheels a lot of the time and reminded me of better movies."
6451,1,"They Cloned Tyrone is at its strongest when it plays off the dynamic of Boyega, Foxx, and Parris. The balance of these personalities clashing and complementing each other... is genuinely hilarious to watch."
6452,1,"It could be tighter, tenser, a little sharper with its satire. Yet there are enough big, better-than-decent movie moments, from shoot-outs to impromptu elevator sing-alongs, that not even a small screen can dilute. That’s entertainment!"
6453,1,It’s funny and more thoughtful than it looks while still maintaining itself as a trenchant social satire.
6454,1,"This is a film that has much to say about the systematic oppression of marginalized and exploited classes, and the powers that be who will go to extreme measures to make sure the more things change, the more things stay the same. Also, it’s funny as hell."
6455,1,"Much of what enlivens Taylor’s debut boils down to its freneticism and substantive commentary, a combination constrained by current-day political apathy but otherwise befitting the madcap atmosphere it engenders."
6456,1,"Slow to start, the movie taps into a genre of “What’s behind the curtain?” paranoia that’s provocative, if a little slim on detail."
6457,1,Director Juel Taylor references a broader spectrum of science-fiction tropes in a satire on racial divides that hits more targets than it misses.
6458,1,"Juel Taylor’s film is genuinely funny at times and the acting is terrific, particularly from Foxx."
6459,1,They Cloned Tyrone is a brilliant movie and has all the makings of a cult classic.
6460,1,They Cloned Tyrone channels its tale of government conspiracy through a stylish lens that revitalizes the blaxploitation aesthetic as the vehicle for satire and insightful commentary wrapped in hyperbole and outrageously entertaining hijinks.
6461,1,“They Cloned Tyrone” is as much a hood manifesto as it is an enthralling dark comedy.
6462,0,At its best this wild genre mashup feels like what we would get if the Coen brothers made a 1970s blaxploitation movie. At its shakiest the film has a hard time maintaining any kind of consistent tone.
6463,1,This subversive combination of sharply observed urban satire and surreal conspiracy thriller generates some big laughs without sacrificing the potency of its underlying social commentary.
6464,1,"A creative, witty surprise in the middle of this summer of relatively dreadful original movies on streaming services."
6465,0,"I suppose [Juel] Taylor and Tony [Rettenmaier] try to go for a “the oppressed eventually become the oppressors in the era of late-stage capitalism” kind of message, but it simply doesn’t land due to the vagueness of the execution."
6466,1,"Afros, brown leather jackets, fur coats: squint and this fantastic directorial debut from Juel Taylor, the writer of Creed II, could be a blaxploitation classic, sandwiched somewhere between Foxy Brown and Black Caesar."
6467,1,"A very funny movie with socially relevant bite, and the best “Get Well Soon” card Jamie Foxx could ever want."
6468,1,"With a stellar cast, They Cloned Tyrone is a one-of-a-kind adventure that delivers on fun, entertainment and hilarity."
6469,1,"They Cloned Tyrone is without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of the year so far! It’s a great throwback to the 70's blaxploitation style films but manages to tell its own story about conspiracies & the real mistreatment of Black communities."
6470,1,"! captivatingly fun movie that mixes the sci-fi, mystery, and action genres to craft a story with relevance and significance and also a scathing social commentary."
6471,1,"It’s well acted, often funny and its observations are sharp. It’s also very profane and a bit disjointed."
6472,1,"The setup and central notion of They Cloned Tyrone are so funny, smart, and incisive that it almost doesn't matter co-writer/director Juel Taylor ... takes a few wrong turns in the third act."
6473,1,Juel Taylor has a good movie on his hands even if it needs a stronger footing and more focus to make the satire land.
6474,1,"They Cloned Tyrone is a movie that I initially wished were as clever as it seemed to want to be, and then turned out to be far more clever than I was giving it credit for."
6475,1,"Juel Taylor's feature debut is a little bit Get Out, a little bit The Cabin in the Woods and a little bit Invasion of the Body Snatchers, while being equal parts weighty and fun."
6476,1,"It’s a movie that will be appreciated rather than be remembered, however, Taylor’s film has “cult classic” written all over it, thanks in part to an outlandish premise, and three exceptional performances from John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris."
6477,1,What sets the movie apart from so many post-Get Out sociological thrillers is the cleverness and style of the path Taylor lays out for his endearing characters.
6478,1,“They Cloned Tyrone” also stands firmly on its glossy style — the evocatively smoky John Carpenter-esque cinematography and the Blaxploitation-inspired costumes — and its spirited performances.
6479,1,"Foxx’s slick, wildly entertaining performance in a movie that directly deals with the same type of conspiracy theories is the best revenge toward all of the keyboard warriors who have spent the last four months speculating about his health."
6480,1,"THEY CLONED TYRONE is a cerebral entertainment with a bold screenplay that turns the dark comic social satire on its head, and features John Boyega giving the best performance of his career."
6481,1,"Working in several genres where it’s difficult not to feel like a copy of a copy, ""They Cloned Tyrone"" does just enough to feel one of a kind."
6482,1,"The film is equal parts entertaining and insightful, and figuratively speaking a book that shouldn’t be judged by its cover."
6483,1,"This slick Blaxploitation homage from writer director Juel Taylor is an absolute joy, which casually mashes up sci-fi staples and cool 70s vibes into a ice-cold concoction worth catching. Jamie Foxx, John Boyega and Teyonah Parris are on blinding form."
6484,1,“They Clone Tyrone” is reminiscent of 70’s blaxploitation films while adding an overtly absurdist sci-fi spin that never comes off as overbearing.
6485,1,"A bizarre, hilarious, and unsettling pleasure that briskly moves with intrigue due to the infectious chemistry between the three leads"
6486,0,"Cheap and pandering kiddie comedy featuring strictly lowest common denominator storytelling and humor, although sometimes so stupid it's funny."
6487,0,It's easy to see why Good Burger garnered negative reviews (including mine) upon its original release and why it's a hallowed Gen Y fave today.
6488,1,Good Burger isn't a great comedy by any means but there are plenty of laughs to be found.
6489,0,Your tolerance for this may be aligned directly to either your age or your IQ.
6490,1,"I've never met Kenan Thompson or Kel Mitchell, but they're in that part of the brain where all past co-workers live, where memory is a thicket of colors and smells and jokes you've heard countless times, and so many special sauces."
6491,0,This was so bad...I hated it.
6492,1,It's not a perfect movie...it's not even a great movie but it makes me laugh and I love Kenan and Kel's chemistry.
6493,0,"If you like your burger well-done, you're in for a disappointment."
6494,1,"[Good Burger] will satisfy their audience's appetite for basic, messy silliness while leaving many grown-ups mildly bemused by the fuzzy obviousness of its humor, the gawky pacing of its sight gags and the second-handedness of its slapstick."
6495,1,"Good Burger isn't USDA Choice by any means, but it's an enjoyable family flick with a nice message about friendship and responsibility."
6496,0,Young fans of TV stars Kenan and Kel are about the only ones who will be remotely amused by this misjudged comedy.
6497,1,"The rest is a pranky, sketchy romp filled with goofy capers by Kenan and Kel. Together, they generate a kind of loopy charm, taking off from Kenan's woozy naivete and Kel's rubber-faced physicality."
6498,0,"There are some cute visuals now and then, but overall Good Burger may raise your blood pressure and, if you suffer through the entire 94 minutes, perhaps even lower your IQ."
6499,0,"Young fans will be amused by the duo's dopey antics, but most adults will simply be perplexed."
6500,0,"The wiry Mitchell and the chubby Thompson may physically suggest such great teams as Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello, but -- at this stage of their development -- the resemblance ends there."
6501,0,"Whatever it is they do so successfully on TV clearly fails to translate to the big screen, particularly when saddled with a script that does no one any favours."
6502,1,"Good-natured '90s comedy loaded with pratfalls, silliness."
6503,0,A laboriously slow suburban adventure...
6504,1,"A fresh, funny, super-sized kid's comedy that may even have a few grown-ups cracking smiles."
6505,1,"The meat of the piece is definitely FDA cinematically approved, and perfect if you like this brand of entertainment with the works."
6506,0,Few people can be so big-hearted as to tolerate Ed's agonizing brand of pedantic humour.

6513,1,Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell [are] a sensational comedy duo the likes of which haven't been seen since Abbott and Costello.
6514,1,Anyone who doesn't smile is probably either too adult to count or too dead to care.

6519,0,"The little ones may well tune in to its wavelength, but woe betide the adult who accompanies them."
6520,1,It's hysterically funny.
6521,0,This is just one of those movies that really shouldn't have been made.
6522,0,"Although clean as a whistle, Good Burger is what show-biz moralist Bill Cosby should be excoriating, along with booty comedies. Its black characters resolutely carry on the tradition of the minstrel show, under the guise of kid entertainment."
6523,1,"Succeeds at what it tries to do, and it manages to be entertaining for adults, too."
6524,1,"Although the show is one I expected to hate, I fell for Ed and his band of idiots."
6525,0,Good Burger is not very well done. But it does have energy.
6526,0,I suspect Mitchell and Thompson are going to be around for a good long while; their clowning talent is as apparent as their schtick is derivative.

6628,1,"Not as deep or emotionally resonant as I expected and the interfaith aspect isn't explored well, but there are plenty of things this coming-of-age film does right. Fortson is wonderful in the title role."

6632,1,"Margaret’s life lessons – awkward as they may be – are just as integral to modern audiences and Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret boldly addresses them with heart, intelligence and care."
6633,1,A small treat that's totally worth it. [Full review in Spanish]
6634,1,A frank and faithful adaptation of her source material. It's also a sobering reminder of how books offering honest depictions of puberty and questioning faith are still subject to removal from school libraries.
6635,0,"One of 2023's most overrated films fails to deliver the sizzle factor that the consensus had promised going in. The kind of movie that doesn't come off as bad or time-stealing, but results in a shoulder shrug. Is that it, Margaret?"
6636,1,"Rejoice. This adaptation of a beloved bestseller is a funny, loving and effervescent joy."
6637,1,"…a fun, original movie that carefully translates the spirit of Judy Blume’s writing to the big screen…"
6638,1,McAdams's performance as Barbara Simon is exceptional; she plays it without a hint of condescension or pandering for younger viewers. She helps make this as great a movie about parenting as it is a great movie about being a kid.
6639,1,"Beautifully acted with Forston, McAdams and Bates leading the charge, Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. is that rare perfect adaptation of a well-loved book."
6640,1,"Once again, Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret. will be guiding a generation through this mystery known as life."
6641,1,"""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret."" delivers on the full promise of its source material, bringing audiences a heartfelt and emotional core about girlhood and faith that has something to teach everyone watching this film."
6642,1,"A wholesome, gorgeously satisfying coming-of-age film that emphasizes the importance of agency. Based on the renowned novel by Judy Blume, it beautifully adapts the story in a manner that will stand the test of time as intricately as the book does."
6643,1,Fremon Craig  delivers one of the few truthful onscreen depictions of entering the teen years fueled by vulnerability and nuance.
6644,1,"This movie is just a lot of fun. It's very heart-touching...This is just a fantastic ""coming of age"" story...even though it's set in the 1970's, it still rings true to modern audiences because people are people no matter what age it [a movie] is set in."
6645,1,"This excellent adaptation of Judy Blume’s landmark novel unfortunately proved to be a box office underachiever -- perhaps they should have renamed it Are You There Mario? It’s Me, Luigi."
6646,1,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret is the definition of delightful & charming! Kelly Fremon Craig crafts the essence of 6th grade, puberty, & awkwardness all into one! BUT MY GOD Abby Ryder Fortson is a triumph & will become your new favorite star!"
6647,1,"Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret. is a touching (and surprisingly brilliant) portrait of the insecurities, awkwardness, and growing pains that forged our pre-teen childhood experiences."
6648,1,"Kelly Fremon Craig fulfills the promise of her endearingly tough debut, The Edge of Seventeen, with a perfectly realized adaptation of Judy Blume's kid-lit classic."
6649,1,The film has a flow that is beautifully balanced between adults and children. The production doesn’t try to be edgy. You understand completely why the book has been wildly successful and impossible to suppress. The movie cares about its characters.
6650,1,This sense of initiative and autonomy is the real draw and Blume does a great job letting it evolve naturally. She lets Margaret put her foot in her mouth and be a sheep before recognizing the error of her way through consequences rather than lectures.
6651,1,"Warm and generous ... It deserves all the love, belated or otherwise, it can get."
6652,1,"It’s a joy to have filmmaker Kelly Fremon Craig back making movies, as this Judy Blume adaptation will become a must-watch for all young audiences."
6653,1,An endearing and delightful coming-of-age film that draws its charm from its grounded portrayal of events.
6654,1,It’s the acting that sends this adaptation into greatness.
6655,1,"Despite the charmingly rendered period setting, the dilemmas remain relevant in what amounts to a big, warm hug of a film."
6656,1,"[Craig] hones in on the details of character, holding precious the emotion of a scene, be it delight or sadness, giddiness or disappointment, or any redolent combinations thereof."
6657,1,"My wish is that the current generation of girls, and boys, take the opportunity to meet Margaret, and learn about life along with her."
6658,1,"The film's beautiful and inspiring sensitivity towards its lead, a truly wonderful performance by Abby Ryder Fortson, brought this grown man to happy tears by its end."
6659,1,It's so innocent. It's really sweet.
6660,1,This film knows what it's doing vis-à-vis teen movies as well as the sacred text [of the book].
6661,1,"Fremon Craig’s film captures the joyful, curious, respectful perspective that has made Blume’s book such a mainstay of contemporary coming-of-age stories because it trusts its middle school protagonists."
6662,1,"All the performances are charming, without being sickly sweet – and with a soundtrack so good..."
6663,1,"In its open-handed approach to religion and puberty, Blume's story will entertain and inspire pretty much everyone who sees it."
6664,1,"For the millions who held the novel dear to their heart, it will be a prayer answered."
6665,1,"It rather resembles one of those montages your smartphone puts together from your photo album every so often — sweet, innocuous and a little impersonal."
6666,1,"A warm, emotionally agile adaptation of Judy Blume’s much-loved 1970 novel."
6667,1,"Considering the numerous traps associated with the material, this brave, funny leap into womanhood and religious consciousness stands in good stead."
6668,1,"It’s nimbly directed by Kelly Fremon Craig, with an occasionally heavy hand of wholesomeness. But Fortson saves the day..."
6669,1,"Basically, the casting is pitch perfect in this intelligent adaptation that gently balances humour with heart."
6670,1,"The long overdue film adaptation is heartwarming, sharply written, wonderfully cast and probably a bit tame for the social media-savvy girls of 2023."
6671,1,...mostly watchable yet thoroughly generic...
6672,1,"Framed in a Polaroid-style Seventies haze, the mood is Classic Coke ad meets the Wonder Years, a sugary concoction that goes down perfectly."
6673,1,This lovely film strikes a universal chord.
6674,1,A minor miracle...
6675,1,"This is a wonderfully charming, warm, tender, pitch-perfect film, much better than anything else I’ve seen recently."
6676,1,"The novel that Blume long prevented from being made into a film has finally received the big-screen treatment. The result, thank goodness, is lovely: tender, funny, at points very moving, and full of precise and careful performances."
6677,1,"Writer-director Kelly Fremon Craig's charming, atmospheric movie is mainly faithful to Judy Blume's iconic novel, fans will be relieved to know, though transferring such an interior life on to the screen is by definition problematic."
6678,1,"Much has changed since Blume first published her work. And, also, very little... Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret remains a radical act of kindness."
6679,1,"lume’s widescreen social context remains, with timely-once-more subplots about reproductive health and sex education."
6680,1,Simply wonderful.
6681,1,"Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret is an utter delight."
6682,1,"McAdams, in what clearly qualifies as the personal best of her career, tells Margaret the unpleasant family history in a clear, deliberate voice, but her eyes betray the lingering pain and sadness that she refuses to express."
6683,1,It comes off as a bland fantasy film about a land peopled by smiling denizens in sunny dreamscapes who have such mild problems that they aren’t actually problems.
6684,1,"It's hard to watch Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret and not be transported to a certain point in your own life."
6685,1,Craig’s humane rendition of the God-and-Margaret fable gets back to the basics and continues to matter against waves of regressive policymaking.
6686,1,It’s the kind of movie that someone of any age can enjoy and find an access point to connect to.
6687,1,"Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret. is really funny and wonderfully awkward at times, but it doesn't forgo sincerity either."
6688,1,"Are you there God? It’s Me, Margaret might lack the anarchy of Fremon Craig’s previous film, The Edge of Seventeen, but this is another empathetic portrayal of being a teenage girl and all the problems that come with that, big and small."
6689,1,"A sweet, eminently sensible film."
6690,1,It's absolutely wonderful... A complete artistic effort.
6691,1,A very winning and charming coming of age film.
6692,1,[The film] brilliantly balances the wonder and fear of puberty with Margaret’s desperate quest to figure out the wider family schisms caused by her parents’ conflicting religious backgrounds.
6693,1,"Directed by Kelly Fremon Craig, “Margaret” isn’t a sharp-focused look at the era (see: “Licorice Pizza”) but a huggable remembrance of a softer time."
6694,1,"Craig's adaptation captures the enduring essence of Judy Blume's source material, with gentle updates to ensure the film clicks with contemporary audiences. Abby Ryder Fortson is a perfect Margaret; McAdams and Bates both deliver solid supporting perfs"
6695,1,An enchanting dramady about an eleven-year old girl dealing with her changing body and her curiosity about religion.
6696,1,"With unforced wit and oodles of charm, “Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret.” resonates in such a touching and compassionate way that you may want to revisit it again, just like countless readers did with the book."
6697,1,Pretty much captures the essence and charm of Judy Bloom's coming of age novel.
6698,1,"Ms. Fortson’s wonderful performance is a heartfelt gem, just like this movie."
6699,1,"Writer/Director Kelly Fremon Craig has done an incredible job at bringing Judy Blume’s spirit onto the big screen. It’s quite funny, as you can feel the joy and hopeful nature that she brings to Margaret."
6700,1,"This warm and winning adaptation of one of Blume’s best-known and best-loved novels has kept its original 1970 setting, and viewers of a certain age will experience the nostalgia centres of their brains lighting up like fireworks."
6701,1,"This wholesome, perfectly cast film does the source material justice, creating a timeless coming-of-age-story that brings Judy Blume’s classic book to life."
6702,1,"The result is something quietly profound, a film that understands that the world at 11 is impossibly endless."
6703,1,"Overall, Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret succeeds in not dwelling on the cringe parts of being a pre-teen and instead revels in the joy of being a child."
6704,1,"A smart, funny, and insightful coming-of-age tale that thoroughly delights from beginning to end."
6705,1,"It’s a soulful account of a story whose classic status is made all the more real by its resonance today. No matter your background, it’s a sweet, honest, moving movie. Period."
6706,1,Margaret feels way less Hollywood and more real when it focuses on its tween characters. Fortson is such a perfect choice for Margaret that she could probably carry the movie all by herself.
6707,1,An ideal pick for parents and tweens/teens -- or for adults who grew up reading the book -- this movie proves that sometimes the right adaptation is worth the wait.
6708,1,"Endearing, empathetic adaptation of Judy Blume's beloved, life-changing novel."
6709,1,It speaks to 1970... and it's actually kind of wholesome.
6710,0,"The film portrays the awkwardness of growing up, but really shines when it centers on Margaret and her family. Instead it focuses more on vignettes, which worked in the book, but gave off a disconnected feeling in the movie."
6711,1,A brilliant and complex coming of age film that’s both familiar yet breaks a lot of new ground in the sub-genre.
6712,1,"Although the target audience is unquestionably mothers and daughters, Are You There God? It’s Me Margaret has things to say to viewers of all genders and ages."
6713,1,Judy Blume rules!!!
6714,1,"An absorbing, funny, and heartfelt coming of age tale..."
6715,1,It’s hard to imagine updating a beloved 1970 novel as well as Fremon Craig has here while also keeping Judy Blume’s original spirit intact.
6716,1,"Innocent, hormonally beset, but kindhearted and truth-seeking Margaret has been a beacon of hope for confused girl tweens since 1970. Director Freemon Craig provides an outstanding movie version of Judy Blume's classic book."
6717,1,"Are You There, God? It’s Me Margaret. is sweet and awkward and relatable across generations."
6718,1,It's an instant classic.
6719,1,...precisely the kind of film that will speak to young adults and teenagers with an ease and accessibility few films come close to achieving.
6720,1,"An endearing coming of age story, told from a female perspective and supported by an incredible cast, that explores the doubts, conflicts, and fears of puberty. [Full Review in Spanish]"
6721,1,"As a critic, I hesitate to use the word “perfect” but it is the first adjective that comes to mind"
6722,1,"With her novel now a likely candidate to be engulfed by the wave of school book bans sweeping the nation, the adaptation renders verbatim and without compromise her sage message to insecure and impressionable young girls."
6723,1,I found a beautiful and authentic story that may be close to a perfect film.
6724,1,"In the end, Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret isn’t a perfect film and ultimately struggles to find a necessary balance, but it more often than not does justice to Blume’s singular authorial voice and resolved approach to telling young women’s stories."
6725,1,"The movie goes easy on a lot of the elements Fremon Craig could have dialed up, and it's to the story's benefit."
6726,1,What an end-of-the-world movie made by Richard Linklater would probably look like.
6727,0,"Charming stars and pleasant scenery are all well and good, but can only carry Bokeh so far."
6728,0,"This issue of character development is largely what holds the film back. Without understanding what makes this couple tick, we are left voyeurs in a world that we cannot understand."
6729,1,As devastatingly beautiful as it is beautifully devastating.
6730,0,"A pretty blur of an apocalypse happens to pretty, blurry people in this dull SF drama. This end of the world brought to you by the Reykjavik Tourist Board."
6731,1,"Beautiful and challenging, Bokeh has a pristine look and chilling feel of its own that contributes enormously to the mood and tone of the whole film."
6732,0,This is a film for the patient and that patience goes largely unrewarded.
6733,1,"It's not really the subject that's important, but how we interpret what's going on in the background."
6734,0,"... never generates much narrative momentum or profound social commentary, although it takes full advantage of the gorgeous Icelandic locations."
6735,1,Only worthwhile storytellers could take an elevator pitch like this one (the last two people on Earth) and produce long-lasting curiosity about its inherent beauty and horror.
6736,1,A contemplative Malick-like drama that leans heavily on its Iceland locations and the genuine chemistry between its two young actors.
6737,0,"We're stuck for eternity with two perfectly decent people who, it seems, just aren't very interesting company. Not even for each other."
6738,0,"Bokeh's depth of field itself is ultimately too shallow, the focus not quite tight enough."
6739,0,The half-baked philosophizing and predictable outcome make the picture an endurance test for your patience.
6740,1,"What sets ""Bokeh"" apart among the ""low-key apocalypse"" cinematic subgenre is not what happens, but what doesn't happen. It's the unknowing that is their undoing. The result is a subtle but ultimately profound humanist message."
6741,1,"As the story gives way to repetitious sightseeing sequences and melodrama, it proves less than fully satisfying. But there's plenty to admire along the way ..."
6742,1,"Small-budget indie films often have to limit their scope and their sights, but Bokeh takes in enough of the protagonists' deserted, lonely world to feel completely convincing."
6743,0,"Strives to be meditative, examining art, life, and the pain of living, but it never achieve its full dramatic wingspan, wasting its potential on actors incapable of keeping their characters compelling."
6744,0,Unimaginative and unconvincing ...
6745,0,"Like its titular aesthetic definition, Bokeh remains completely out of focus both narratively and thematically."

6754,1,"The wholly absorbing, irresistible character study of two men who aren’t always who they seem to be, one haunted by the demons of his past choices and the other crippled by guilt and attempting to preserve his identity while hiding in plain sight."
6755,1,"If you like slow movies with tough, serious themes, based on true events, with sinister and dark characters, go for it."
6756,1,To call it an impressive and offbeat crime drama is putting it very lightly.  [Full review in Spanish]
6757,1,"A movie whose every dark or overcast shot, every quiet conversion and every revelation contributes to the rising tension and the inescapable gloom tinged with grief that follows this ""Stranger” — up close, and from a distance — from beginning to end."
6758,1,"Wright crafts a hyper-elaborate set-up and delicate drip-feed of information which make spoilers an equal crime, but The Stranger is more of a felt experience than a traditional policier."
6759,0,An annoying chore. A stronger second half comes some way in making the ordeal worth it if you haven’t already dropped off for a tactical mid-fest snooze.
6760,1,"The Stranger offers strong, subtle performances from its leads, and a freshly vital approach to familiar material."
6761,1,Wright artfully directs his film with the kind of precision that’ll keep you hanging on to every shot.
6762,0,There is a good film in The Stranger somewhere. But viewers will have to wade through a lot of clunky chronology to find it.
6763,1,"This quiet, sly crime movie is yet another gem from Australia's Blue-Tongue collective."
6764,1,Finely tuned unconventional crime drama about a brooding psychopath protagonist.
6765,1,"Generating an increasingly tense, immersive atmosphere, [director Thomas M] Wright gets some intense performances from his leads in a skilfully minimalist film"
6766,1,...dramatic fiction with thematic overlaps to Al-Khatib’s documentary...
6767,1,"It does move to its own unique gritty rhythm. But once you get in step with it, it’s hard to turn away."
6768,1,The mystery is always kept to your attention and the police procedural that results is fascinating.
6769,1,"Writer/director Thomas M. Wright’s true crime suspense thriller is a collection of shattered fragments, from its crosscutting among various story and timelines to the shattered psyches of its protagonists..."
6770,1,The film builds up as the story moves forward and revitalizes the undercover cop genre to focus on the perturbed psyche of the policeman in question. [Full review in Spanish]
6771,1,One of the best things to be said about this is that it's difficult to get too much into why The Stranger works without spoiling the story.
6772,1,Taut and effective.
6773,1,"Sean Harris further cements his reputation as one of the most magnetic screen actors today; sporting a colossal beard and shoulder-length hair, his character here is an endlessly watchable presence and enigma."
6774,1,"Toes the dangerous line of befriending the enemy and transcends the final results of an investigation. It's cryptic, hard, sober, and at times too disperse... [Full review in Spanish]"
6775,1,"The Stranger is spare, disciplined storytelling with stark visuals and a strained tone."
6776,1,The Stranger proves that Wright is a capable director and writer who can create a compelling piece of art that unsettles audiences.
6777,1,The title hardly represents the kind of slow-burn death stare into the heart of the abyss that this film is.
6778,0,"With such unswerving focus on a single atmosphere, the film can drift into repetitiveness, and even Edgerton and Harris’ captivating performances can’t entirely carry the film through its sagging middle."
6779,1,The lonely toll of undercover police work is intensified to maximum grimness by its life-and-death stakes.
6780,1,"... A fascinating and perturbing psychological thriller. In spite of such a generic title, this film avoids genre conventions and tropes. [Full review in Spanish]"
6781,1,"Wright remarkably shows you how instead of iron fists as tools, we see Edgerton’s Mark uses something entirely different — empathy."
6782,1,"The pace is patient and even slow at times, made more noticeable by repeated vague imagery, but on the whole, this drama provides a thrilling watch in a subdued presentation."
6783,1,A film of nigh-unparalleled tension.
6784,1,What makes The Stranger work is how this all creates an experience that feels as though the two men have become almost doomed to a life where they will aimlessly wander in what feels like an Australian purgatory.
6785,1,"""The Stranger"" reminds us that sometimes the most horrifying stories are the ones found in reality, not on the big screen or in the pages of a book."
6786,1,"This was always going to be an inherently discomforting and distressing movie, but it's also an unwaveringly intelligent and impressive examination of trauma."
6787,1,"Wright is undoubtedly working in the same grim idiom that has occupied Kurzel since his grizzly 2011 feature debut, Snowtown: the latent violence of the Australian landscape, as channelled by damaged men living on the fringes."
6788,1,A highly sophisticated film about fractured identities and the way the trauma of a violent crime continues to resonate beyond the original incident.
6789,1,"It’s truly well-made on all fronts, with some solid, tension-filled sound work alongside brooding cinematography and a set of delicate performances led by a great director."
6790,1,"Deft, delicate and empathetic, yet ultimately piercing and unforgiving. A phenomenal work."
6791,1,"Wright at least has something more to say with The Stranger. Of double lives and lines crossed, of what it takes to catch a monster and keep that darkness from your door."
6792,1,"In tone, the film is brilliantly hidden. It takes a long while to work out what’s happening. The atmosphere is gloomy, distrustful, brutal in language, with a jangly soundscape and music."
6793,1,"… a standout, a high-octane look into the pursuit of a criminal – a compelling and measured film that delivers …"
6794,1,To call it an unconventionally impressive crime drama is to put it very lightly.
6795,1,It’s the kind of thriller that only comes along every once in a while -- truly unsettling and with enough twists and turns to not only keep you interested but on your toes.
6796,1,"Wright has made an intelligent and sombre film that delves into the murky depths of violence and depicts the repercussions that contact with evil can have, the effects rippling out and touching even those who are completely oblivious to its existence."
6797,1,The Stranger definitely feels like an elevated genre exercise -- more challenging than the average crime drama but also more interesting.
6798,1,The Stranger is a bleak thriller that boasts great performances from Joel Edgerton and Sean Harris.
6799,0,"The convoluted plot is withholding in a way that makes it difficult to truly connect with the story, as worthy a subject it might be."
6800,1,You’re left with an admiration for the extraordinary police work that usually remains secret by its very nature -- and this quietly compelling insight will stay with you for a while.
6801,1,"This is a curious, slightly underwhelming offering. Even so, falling flat as a result of being understated to a fault is a promising event in a genre dominated by obvious signposting, and Wright is certainly one to watch for the future."
6802,1,"“The Stranger” confirms that Wright has arrived, even if his treatment sometimes feels more oblique and self-consciously arty than the material demands."
6803,1,To call it an unconventionally impressive crime drama is to put it very lightly.

6820,1,"“The Stranger” confirms that Wright has arrived, even if his treatment sometimes feels more oblique and self-consciously arty than the material demands."
6821,1,"Humbling and epic in scope, designed and conceptualised brilliantly, but a tad too stand-off-ish emotionally. While the father-daughter dynamic works in parts, the Cooper–Brand relationship is never given the right treatment and collapses."
6822,1,This is a film where complex concepts of quantum physics and powerful human emotions are inextricably intertwined and the ghost that haunts the farmhouse has both a scientific explanation and a sense of supernatural power.
6823,1,"""Interstellar"" pushes the limits for personal interpretation of both science and fiction. Both elements are wildly heightened to a bold scale to address the internal opposites between logic and spectacle, science and sentiment, and brains and emotion."
6824,1,…uses sci-fi to go beyond into the philosophical and spiritual beyond that few other epics can reach….
6825,1,"Nolan’s most openly emotional film, he fully lived up to his “Stanley Kubrick’s eye and Steven Spielberg’s heart” identity with this grand sci-fi epic about the sheer force of will that we have for those we love."
6826,1,Interstellar utilizes science in a way that strives for authenticity in a science-fiction thriller and it's why we're still discussing the Christopher Nolan film today.
6827,1,"As Robert Bresson once said, “I’d rather people feel a film before understanding it.” Interstellar moved me, and I didn’t find myself fact checking the science so I could complain on Twitter."
6828,1,"Staggeringly beautiful, bafflingly complex, this is proper event cinema."
6829,1,"The film demands quite a bit of time from its viewers too, but its big ideas and wondrous sights are ample reward."
6830,0,"When Mann appears to explain man, it collapses under the weight of a repeated thesis that doesn’t merit such explicit, redundant reiteration."
6831,1,It’s a contemplative adventure and an emotional exploration that captivated me from its opening moments.
6832,1,Rarely do epics of this scope and intelligence reach theaters anymore; such serious commercial filmmaking seems like a market almost exclusively maintained by Christopher Nolan.
6833,1,"While not all-together perfect, the film represents a monumental cinematic achievement that deserves to be placed high within the caliber of Nolan’s filmography."
6834,1,"The inherent message of the film brings hope, but it can definitely get waterlogged by intellectual speak and long-winded scenes."
6835,1,The film is indeed a sight to behold -- and one that demands to be seen on the biggest possible screen.
6836,1,"Nolan reaches for the stars with beautifully composed shots and some mind-bending special effects, but the dime store philosophy of the story never achieves lift off."
6837,0,Audiences are sure to lose their suspensions of disbelief over the nearly impenetrable climax.
6838,1,...an often insanely ambitious science fiction epic that that remains mesmerizing for most of its (admittedly overlong) running time...
6839,1,"Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement."
6840,1,"A big-budget reprise of ideas Nolan has been exploring since the beginning of his career. Not only is it a film about the passage of time, it's also a film about memory."
6841,0,"None of these characters feel fully-fledged... for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, it's alarming how lacking it is in this department."
6842,1,Interstellar is not Christopher Nolan's best film but what I will say is that you can't deny his ambition.
6843,1,As spectacular as it is flawed.
6844,1,"Interstellar is not only a grand space adventure worthy of the big screen, it's also a powerfully emotional story about the bond between a father and daughter, and how that love can drive one to attempt the impossible."
6845,1,"One of the boldest science-fiction movies I've ever seen, both in narrative and visual terms. [Full review in Spanish]"
6846,1,It was a blockbuster movie-going experience.
6847,1,I guess the take away is all you need is love... and morse code?
6848,1,"Interstellar is, all in all, a very fine science fiction film."
6849,0,Interstellar is 120 minutes of good movie stuffed into 170 minutes.
6850,1,Interstellar is Nolan at his most humane. It's a good look for him.
6851,0,"Overall, Interstellar looks nice but ultimately lacks substance. Nolan essentially loses his way by going to space."
6852,1,The space voyage is easily one of Nolan's most thought-provoking films yet. It's definitely his most ambitious.
6853,1,"As far as a masterful visualization of space and an exploration of profound theory, it belongs on a shortlist of must see films which it's comparably akin to... But Nolan's film falls short in other realms, namely the human component."
6854,1,It's as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time - it goes by in a flash - you feel as if you've experienced something that is so rarely captured on film.
6855,1,Christopher Nolan more than deserves however much money the studios are willing to keep giving him to make these brainy beautiful blockbusters.
6856,0,"Preposterous, pseudointellectual, poorly constructed, clichéd, impenetrably masculine, goofy and possessed of an indecipherable ending, Interstellar is the mother of all misfires."
6857,1,"Moreso than any of his previous projects, Interstellar left me largely confounded, wondering if Nolan had finally ""lost it."""
6858,1,"The old saying ""shoot for the moon - even if you miss you'll land among the stars"" has never rung quite as true as it does here."
6859,1,"There is absolutely a breathlessness to Interstellar, although perhaps too much of that is huffing and puffing."
6860,1,I found it emotionally moving and... what I wanted in a good sci-fi movie.
6861,1,"Interstellar may not be perfect, but tent-pole filmmaking with such ambition and grandeur is always worth celebrating."
6862,1,"With the likes of Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, Ellen Burstyn and John Lithgow as supporting players, it is redundant to say that the ensemble adds so much more to a film that boasts excellence in all departments."
6863,0,"A contrived science fiction film without authenticity, emotionally and narratively."
6864,1,"A celestial tapestry of space exploration, time bender and heartfelt human story, it earns its place among the stars."
6865,0,"Literally reaches for the stars -- and comes up short. Despite the best efforts of a talented cast and writer/director Christopher Nolan, this film just can't overcome a script with black hole-size plot craters."
6866,1,"Interstellar is impressive. It is superbly made, and combines compelling thought about everything from ecology to the nature of time to a child's belief in ghosts into something cohesive and mostly engrossing."
6867,1,The summary work of Nolan: apotheosis of his signature where he attempts to merge the philosophical and emotional in entertaining genre packages.
6868,1,"It's the rare combination of a film that's both enjoyable in the theater and afterward, hashing through it over a drink"
6869,1,"Interstellar magnifies Nolan's style to a tremendous degree, but that also means enlarging his own flaws too."
6870,1,"For this critic, Nolan hits shy of the mark for cinematic brilliance but still manages to land a visually stunning entertainment in its own right."
6871,1,Succeeds on a level that has been largely foreign to the celluloid-loving director: the emotional.
6872,1,"The planets in the new galaxies are creatively different yet familiar, beautiful and ugly, habitable but not habitable. They have their own histories and realities and have no interest in being colonised by the US of A."
6873,1,"The enchantment of a Christopher Nolan film, the sheer majesty of it, if you will, is surrendering to it."
6874,1,"Interstellar is an ambitious story, and while the theme of love transcends time and space is a bit shoehorned into the script, it still rings true. Matthew McConaughey delivers one of the finest pieces of acting on film."
6875,1,I think the reason why I connected so deeply with it is the extent to which Nolan evokes iconic moments from silent films.
6876,0,"What is wrong with the movie - some of the messages are lathered on so thickly... yet the Nolan brothers assume that all viewers have a keen grasp of quantum physics, relativity, time dimensions and gravity."
6877,1,"The result is a mess. But it's a beautiful mess, and one that I wouldn't want you to miss for the world."
6878,1,Watching Christopher Nolan fall short is still more exciting than watching most other directors succeed.
6879,0,Nolan's refreshing love affair with self-determination goes too far.
6880,1,"...visually spectacular, complex, and both intellectually and emotionally stimulating...[Full review in Spanish]"
6881,1,"Visually striking, with an impressive cast... [Full review in Spanish]"
6882,1,"Christopher Nolan's spectacular film is filled with frustration, anger, and guilt, and also strives for acceptance and even redemption."
6883,1,"Eye-popping visuals, an ambitious narrative, and a heart-racing soundtrack; one of Nolan's best"
6884,1,Interstellar is why we go to the movies.
6885,1,This intergalactic extravaganza is clearly in a class by itself.
6886,0,Big Ideas served in a movie that is ultimately unsatisfying.
6887,1,"With all the rampant think pieces questioning the probability of every science fiction film that comes out, it's comforting to across a movie that doesn't really claim to have any of the answers."
6888,1,"Interstellar is a beautiful, irritating, awe-inspiring mess. It's the kind of movie Hollywood simply doesn't make any more - and that's exactly why you should see it."
6889,0,"Nolan does (to his credit) and his failure to engage us as fully as he intends... takes us to infinity and beyond, but it's likely you cared more about Buzz Lightyear than you will about anyone in Interstellar."
6890,1,"It's flawed, certainly, but its vision is undeniably appealing and ultimately the film's saving grace."
6891,1,"A film made with meticulousness and ambition, that achieves its tasks both narrative and visual with singular efficiency and grandiloquence that never feels forced. [Full review in Spanish]"
6892,0,"Naturally, Nolan's desire to unite high and low culture doesn't always pay off, yet even when he gets pretentious, I don't hate him for it. Better a filmmaker who fails while overreaching than one who has a hit with Transformers."
6893,0,"Interstellar, though ambitious and thrilling at points, is too complicated and doesn't reach its full potential."
6894,0,"Interstellar has more of absolutely everything: more plot, more (stupid) words, more acting and much more bad acting (Anne Hathaway) than nearly all the year's films put together, as well as the most idiotic storyline of the decade."
6895,1,"It is a wondrously beautiful movie, with intense sci-fi sequences, a solid and talented cast, and even some thought-provoking ideas. This is not one to be missed."
6896,1,Christopher Nolan is incredibly good at making science-fiction movies for people who think they don't like sci-fi.
6897,1,"Interstellar never feels overly long despite its almost three hour running time. It also packs an emotional wallop, if you let it."
6898,1,"It's his 'White Album,' overlong and overwritten, corny and self-important, and also a great movie. And yes, it can be all of those things at once."
6899,1,"Can we fly a spaceship through a galactic wormhole to Saturn? We haven't even put a man on Mars yet! It's another 342,077,666.43 miles from Mars to Saturn! Fuggeddaboudit!"
6900,0,"Perhaps it would have been wiser to trim back on several of the ideas and present a more cohesive, not to mention coherent, story."
6901,1,Interstellar feels like a collection of arresting moments and ideas that don't quite hang together.
6902,1,The result is a flawed but highly engaging experience that is as frustrating as it is astonishing.
6903,1,"A blockbuster that's profound, poignant and exhilarating."
6904,0,"Too literal-minded, too conspicuous to leave us with a sense of doubt and apprehension."
6905,1,Nolan's Interstellar waxes poetic about the universality of love and lingers beautifully on worlds beyond ours.
6906,1,A dynamic left-right combo of spectacle and heart that efficiently covers over the screenplay's various cracks and crevices.
6907,1,Interstellar needs to be seen on the biggest screen you can get your eyes on for maximum impact.
6908,0,"When the essential property of film forces us to believe in an illusion, [Nolan] has become the least-spiritual director in contemporary cinema."
6909,1,"This epic film will still leave its mark on our collective memories, for it succeeds in affecting us. However, a bit of humor and humility would have been appreciated in this journey, which takes itself far too seriously."
6910,0,I can't remember an apocalyptic film that's taken less interest in this planet as it's destroyed.
6911,0,This is a film rife with mistakes that even a rookie director wouldn't make. How this ended up being made by Nolan blows my mind.
6912,1,This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.
6913,1,"[Interstellar] is a mighty science fiction epic built upon seriously shaky science. Yet that's hardly the point when this strives so hard, so achingly, to be profound. And very nearly is too."
6914,1,"Interstellar may be a failure on a story level, but Nolan's visual virtuosity is still enough to take your breath away and root you to your chair."
6915,1,"Let's be plain. Christopher Nolan has made a lopsided soufflé of a film, but one with such fine ingredients you can hardly complain about the shape when you're enjoying the taste."
6916,1,"Interstellar dares it viewers to come along on a perilous adventure that is immersive, impressive, and intelligent."
6917,0,Nolan is a well-appointed mainstream fabulist who uses a great deal of money and technology to no great artistic purpose.
6918,0,"...after building up the drama of personal sacrifice, it feels too much like a cheat no matter how many endings are tacked on before the credits..."
6919,0,"It's just a really weird film, the strangest and most misguided fake-Spielberg picture since Super 8."
6920,1,Visual splendor does not entirely make up for failures in plotting and characterization.
6921,1,"While it's far too intense, the film's pungent energy holds the interest. But some fresh air might have allowed the story to breathe more meaningfully, because it has a lot to say."
6922,0,"Manodrome lacks depth as social commentary or character study, largely because of how it positions us in relation to its protagonist’s perspective."
6923,0,"An ambitious, unpleasant, and ultimately unsuccessful examination of toxic masculinity and cult mentality, this dark drama gets by for a long while on Eisenberg's aching, physical performance."
6924,0,"Jesse Eisenberg is fantastic, even if the movie itself is rocky."
6925,1,"[It] ends on its least hyperbolic note, to graceful, even somewhat touching effect. But until then, it piles on contrary devices, some of a ripped-from-headlines ilk, without creating the organic character inner life or narrative that might unify them..."
6926,0,"The cast gives their all, but the film ultimately has nothing to offer."
6927,0,Manodrome makes all the obvious moves.
6928,0,"With the help of a hideous haircut, Eisenberg gives a convincing performance as a repressed loser who never discovered who he is and has officially run out of time to start. But Trengrove’s script is as directionless as his protagonist."
6929,1,"It's Eisenberg who finds Ralphie in those narrative spaces, creating a whole and crushingly convincing portrait of a profoundly lost man, and the damage left in his wake."
6930,1,Trengove seems determined to defy the standard solutions to this sort of mess.
6931,0,"Crude and sensationalizing, “Manodrome” is like an amalgam of all the headlines you’ve read about the kinds of men who succumb to warped ideologies."
6932,1,"…a hard film to love, but it’s a fearless insight into the collapsing white-male mind-set, and features another scorching performance from Eisenberg, who shrugs off the bookish, sensitive aura that has been his signature..."
6933,1,"Ambitious to a fault, Manodrome does remain unsettlingly gripping throughout delving into incel culture, with an exacting, tough-to-shake performance from Jesse Eisenberg"
6934,0,"Dark and initially intriguing, but shallow, unimaginative and heavy-handed. In a double feature with Fight Club or Taxi Driver, it would be the inferior B-movie."
6935,0,"Sadly, “Manodrome” doesn’t remain in an enigmatic state of mind, slowly growing unwieldly the more explicit Trengove gets with the details of this unraveling."
6936,0,[A] missed opportunity [that] ends up more of a Taxi Driver lite than fully embraced its premise. It’s a pity because this is one of [Jesse] Eisenberg’s best performances I’ve ever seen in a long while.
6937,1,Dark take on toxic masculinity.
6938,0,"The film has relevance, of course, at a time when vulnerable men are groomed and politicized, but, curiously, Manodrome doesn’t investigate that at all, preferring instead to be an well-worn melodrama with a varnish of faux importance."
6939,0,The current American imagination seems utterly unable to understand acts of kindness require greater heroism than acts of violence.
6940,1,"The subcultures in Manodrome are ostensibly a work of fiction but, exaggerated as they may be, are no less plausible or rife with intrigue."
6941,1,"It's hallucinating and perhaps predictable, yet it never ceases to be surprising. [Full review in Spanish]"

6944,1,An impressive Jesse Eisenberg courts our empathy and our rage as a wounded man broken down by confrontation with the one thing he cannot fathom -- kindness.
6945,1,"While John Trengrove’s skill is apparent in the slow build of tension, it also stands out in the arguably more impressive way that he holds Ralphie’s view of the world separate from that of the film’s."
6946,1,A bleak and accurate depiction of the ouroboros of toxic masculinity that is only growing more fork-tongued.
6947,1,"Manodrome feels like the first proper film for the manosphere, and yet it does not concern the Internet at all: no 4chan, no Reddit, no avatars nor slang."
6948,0,"Lacks the emotion or insight that may have put a unique spin on this well-trodden tale. Instead, it becomes another brutal slog through the unpleasant psyche of a troubled man."
6949,0,"The helmer has set out to shock and surprise, but the twists instead just feel rigged to reaffirm his own views of toxic masculinity."
6950,0,"While Brody brings effortless authority to his role as the soft-spoken but creepy cult leader, the film has more or less jumped the shark by the time we get a full picture of what his retreat for wounded men is all about."
6951,1,"Despite its flaws, Manodrome is still a sensible exploration of how toxic masculinity changes, shapes, and slips through the cracks while fighting to survive in a world where the patriarch is constantly under assault."
6952,0,"The film’s base elements and intentions are interesting, but it doesn’t offer much in terms of original insight."

6988,0,"The film’s base elements and intentions are interesting, but it doesn’t offer much in terms of original insight."
6989,0,"Lone Survivor’s major saving grace is that it never resorts to actual flag-waving, but enough pro-military overtones subsist in the material to consider it an effective recruiting video."
6990,1,"Peter Berg goes beyond the call of duty to forge a bond between the audience and the film's forlorn, leaving us hoping that the expected doesn't end up coming true."
6991,1,At its core it isn't a propaganda film or a slice of patriotism; instead it's a stark reminder of the camaraderie of soldiers in the field.
6992,1,"Appreciably tense, gripping, graphic, grim, and nerve-wracking."
6993,1,Overwhelmed is exactly how you should feel watching this film.
6994,0,"Lone Survivor 's politics are reflected in its crude, ham-fisted aesthetics."
6995,0,"The intent is sincere, but the execution heavy handed and excessive."
6996,1,"There are near fetish levels of body horror going on here, as Berg luxuriates in every gaping wound and bullet hole, pummeling his cast beyond any possible human boundaries."
6997,1,"Berg has taken pains to create a brutal, distressing, and unashamedly in-your-face depiction of the atrocities of war... The result is, for Berg and star Mark Wahlberg, a career best endeavor."
6998,0,"Feels more like a military recruitment commercial than an actual film, filled with superficial displays of patriotism."
6999,0,Lone Survivor resembles an extended recruitment advert for the first half and a snoozily detached war movie for the second - which is fitting because that's what it is.
7000,0,Lone Survivor may have served its original purpose -- whatever that may have been -- had it not been so mind-numbingly repetitive.
7001,1,"It's hard to watch at times, but you can't deny the emotional impact."
7002,1,"This appears to be the movie that its makers intended, but it still feels like a little more depth could have provided much more impact."
7003,1,"Surprisingly, what makes this story hit home is the acting. All four men bring a quiet realism to their roles-the less they think of themselves as heroes, the more we do."
7004,1,It... challenges the viewer to reconsider simpleminded moralizing when it comes to war action.
7005,1,The fact that war really is hell is always kept front and centre throughout. Tobia Schliesser's cinematography is brilliant. This one's an adrenaline- packed ride all the way.
7006,0,"Peter Berg's latest directorial effort, the Navy SEALs drama Lone Survivor, is no better than a limp retelling that fails to get underneath the surface of the actual story."
7007,1,It's what an action movie should be at its best; the shots fired are less interesting than the personal struggles of the men in battle.
7008,1,Berg's film is beautifully shot and thrillingly paced; he and his actors have a real affection for these men and feel a real duty to portray them honorably.
7009,1,"Berg's direction is as energetic as ever, and there's rarely a moment that's not both engaging and horrifying to watch."
7010,1,"'Survivor' has a 'you are there' feeling; sound-barrier-breaking rounds, RPG explosions, and Navy SEAL-scripting of real firefight lingo: 'Left is not good! Right is good!'"
7011,1,"""Lone Survivor"" isn't a classic, but it's a modestly affecting war pic that artfully pays tribute to some real American heroes - exactly what it sets out to do."
7012,1,This is war at its most thrilling!
7013,0,"The unwillingness to ""engage"" in larger questions disconcertingly reduces a real-life tragedy to an action movie."
7014,1,"Despite the lack of character development, watching these guys struggle to prevail was enthralling and heartbreaking all at once."
7015,1,"Whatever the political undercurrent at work, every so often you have to remind yourself that this happened to four young men, no doubt the brightest stars of loving families."
7016,1,"Peter Berg is effectively offering four Rambos for the price of one - the Seals' bullet-whistling gunfight scenes are a combination of Saving Private Ryan on a ridge, Heat on a hill and Open Range out in the open. Bang, bang, bang! And bang again!"
7017,0,"Lone Survivor comes off as a celebration of the martyred American soldier, that myth that makes it that much easier for old men to send young men to their deaths."
7018,0,Knowing the outcome tends to lessen the intensity of the well-shot action sequences.
7019,1,"""Lone Survivor"" thrills, horrifies and also punches home the simple point that individual acts of conscience can save lives, and even change the world."
7020,1,Encontra seus melhores momentos em suas sequências de ação.
7021,1,This is an intense film. You get a clear sense of the panic these guys felt and the hopelessness of their situation.
7022,1,"Narrative cohesion is not the film's strong suit, but battlefield authenticity most certainly is."
7023,1,"Lone Survivor is a proficiently-made film with plenty to enjoy, but truly embracing it is difficult outside of an American context."
7024,1,"Lone Survivor is a proficiently-made film with plenty to enjoy, but truly embracing it is difficult outside of an American context."
7025,1,The most harrowing combat film since Saving Private Ryan.
7026,1,"Small in scale but just as intense, Lone Survivor's extended battle recalls the opening of Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. like its hardy protagonists, is determined to get the job done."
7027,1,"If there's one major message at the core of Peter Berg's outstanding, realistic, fact-based war film it's that no amount of new-fangled military technology can take away from the brutality and human cost of frontline fighting."
7028,1,"Though the film predictably finishes on just one of its number, it is in the many that Lone Survivor's components best succeed."
7029,1,Not since Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down has there been such a vivid account of a mission gone wrong.
7030,1,"If Mark Wahlberg stars as an interesting character, the movie has a fighting chance at the box office - and this one became a hit."
7031,1,"It will be remembered for its bone-breaking, blood-splattering, white-knuckle skirmish - not for its performances, characters, plot or dialogue. On this level, it works."
7032,1,For all its flaws it is both a gripping action thriller and an unforgettable depiction of the cold realities of war. My first reaction after seeing it was a simple one: this must be how it was. It may be the highest tribute I can pay.
7033,1,"The film doesn't glorify war, it pays tribute to courage and determination; while it doesn't play politics, it does show the Taliban as vicious, bloodthirsty and mercil"
7034,0,"...a disappointing, underwhelming actioner from Peter Berg..."
7035,1,"A portrayal of strict military excellence and grueling physical performances, to which Mark Wahlberg brings his best game."
7036,1,It's a heartfelt tribute to the brave young American soldiers who sacrifice their lives for their country but it also makes that sacrifice seem like the most exciting extreme sport imaginable.
7037,1,"Captures the raw intensity of combat and carnage on both sides of the battlefront, and the heroics that forge an indelible spirit in combat"
7038,1,It's not perfect... but this is a major step up from Berg's previous travesty. This is actually quite good.
7039,1,"Lone Survivor sticks pretty closely to the facts, has real momentum and a series of impressive action sequences"
7040,0,"While the violence is horrifying, the encasing narrative is perversely ""heroic"", with corn-fed dialogue presented as solidly non-ironic, and images of the real-life combatants used to stirring, manipulative ends."
7041,0,"While its aspirations are high and its intentions are genuine, the film is a slick and hollow war drama that benefits from some harrowing battle sequences."
7042,1,An occasionally smart script - and four excellent actors - keep the project grounded.
7043,1,"Authentic military detail, generic storytelling and manly patriotism battle it out in a gut-wrenching war movie that celebrates heroism under fire."
7044,1,Lone Survivor does a magnificent job of making disorder intelligible. It's not a very nice film. But it is a splendidly effective one.
7045,1,Lone Survivor does a magnificent job of making disorder intelligible. It's not a very nice film. But it is a splendidly effective one.
7046,0,The relentless intensity quickly grows numbing.
7047,0,"Replete with a certain kind of self-importance and self-forgiveness, this Afghan war movie starring Mark Wahlberg has a distinctively martyred America-at-bay feel."
7048,1,There are nuggets of honesty amid the gung-ho jingoism in Peter Berg's starry-eyed war story.
7049,1,"The picture may not be in contention for Oscars but it's a first-class modern war film: visceral, exciting and thought-provoking."
7050,1,The film alternates between the pulverisingly immediate and dismayingly generic.
7051,1,"[The second act] is the core of the film, and it works very well. What falls on either side has been designed to support it, but comes close to achieving the opposite."
7052,0,Lone Survivor is well made and well acted but its refusal to pass comment on the central mission means that it ultimately feels like a gung ho fantasy that lacks emotional impact.
7053,1,"Luttrell's remarkable story of survival is worth telling. Inevitably, the temptation to depict US military as consummate heroes creeps through. Yet it's a more balanced account than you might expect."
7054,1,"nothing if not a deeply felt paean to the characters' toughness, bravery, and, most importantly, humanity"
7055,1,"Berg reconstructs the gunfight brilliantly. Superb stunts, a dizzying use of handheld cameras, great editing and brilliant acting combine to make this the most intense war movie since Black Hawk Down."
7056,1,Lone Survivor isn't always sophisticated ... But there's moral complexity and a climax in an Afghan village which is tense and surprisingly moving.
7057,1,"A severe portrait of fortitude under extreme pressure, somewhat marred by blinkered politics."
7058,1,"Mark Wahlberg stands firm as Luttrell and he also produced this version of events which, ultimately, celebrates the brotherhood of soldiers and hits hard, on a gut level."
7059,0,"The direction pummels and the cast impress, yet Berg's war movie promises more than it delivers."
7060,1,"Hard edges, clean visual lines of action, very little gung-ho boo-rah."
7061,1,"A noble, moving tribute."
7062,1,Lone Survivor' hits home and hits hard.
7063,1,A harrowing bone-crackling blow-by-blow account of a failed reconnaissance mission that finishes with a dose of humanity.
7064,1,"The film shows us the landscape of modern warfare, which when it is men with guns facing each other is pretty much the way war has been in the trenches since the Civil War."
7065,1,"[Mark] Wahlberg in particular has really come into his own these past few years, doing the best work of his career. His level of commitment here is second to none."
7066,1,"In its quieter moments, the movie aptly displays the bond of brotherhood that unites the SEALS, as they tease, chide, encourage and protect each other."
7067,1,"You will endure much pain and suffering on the screen, yet there is rare power in this story of survival, a glimmer of hope when it feels like all has been lost."
7068,1,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat, but I can't be sure if it was the result of some buffed and beautiful performances from the brawny cast, or a latent sense of sympathetic jock itch."
7069,1,Think Zero Dark Thirty minus the happy ending.
7070,0,"While it's obvious he means well - Berg clearly reveres these soldiers - he doesn't seem all that interested in depicting who they were as men. Heck, Die Hard's John McClane was a more fully sketched character than any of these real-life action heroes."
7071,1,It doesn't matter whether you are for or against military involvement in Afghanistan; this is a film that captures the bond between those who serve.
7072,1,"At its best, it recalls the intimate fist-to-face, bayonet-to-belly battlefield films of yore; less successfully, it wears its (purple) heart on its sleeve, almost demanding at times that you rise from your seat with your hand on your heart..."
7073,0,[VIDEO ESSAY] All films are political. All film is propaganda. Conscious awareness that Peter Berg's seemingly straight-ahead war picture is a two-hour recruitment commercial designed for the U.S. military to seduce testosterone-filled American males...
7074,0,"Battle scenes have about as much realism as ""Kill Bill"". Politics are vintage Chuck Norris/Sylvester Stallone."
7075,1,"Berg's direction is super intense, especially during the prolonged fire-fights in the mountains - sequences which will likely leave viewers feeling as bruised, breathless and scared as the soldiers themselves."
7076,1,A tribute to anyone standing up for themselves on the front lines of any dangerous conflict situation.
7077,0,A mediocre military drama and just a sub-par human drama...
7078,1,It would be hard to make the story any grimmer on film
7079,1,Never get involved in a land war in Asia.
7080,1,Lone Survivor is writer/director Peter Berg's best to date...
7081,1,"The battle sequences are as grueling, as excruciating, as the running gunfights in 'The Wild Bunch.' Indeed, in places 'Lone Survivor' feels more like a revisionist western than a war movie."
7082,1,"There's a gruesome, you-are-there authenticity to the action as the heroes spill their blood and guts on the battlefield."
7083,0,"Employing only the most minimal of brushstrokes to differentiate the men, Berg doesn't seem particularly interested in them as individuals, meaning that instead of their real-life monikers, the credits might as well read ""Navy SEAL 1,"" ""Navy SEAL 2,"" etc."
7084,1,"Berg doesn't seem to have made the film as a piece of propaganda. He made the film to celebrate American heroes who put their lives on the line, and suffer the consequences."
7085,1,"The full impact doesn't come until the very end, when we see actual photos of Luttrell's three comrades and the 16 others who died trying to save them. If seeing their faces and realizing how much was lost doesn't shake you, nothing ever will."
7086,1,"""Lone Survivor"" is a pretty good war movie based on an incredible and moving account of courage and survival."
7087,1,"For battle-worn returnees of the struggles in Afghanistan, I suspect this film will trigger deep-seated memories of the military brotherhood they experienced, and the unspeakable losses they endured."
7088,0,"...the real reason why one man could be left standing while 19 others actually died gets rushed into a 30-minute climax, featuring a surprising wartime humanity that won't be revealed here."
7089,1,"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves isn’t just one of the best films of 2023, it’s one of the best fantasy films in decades."
7090,1,"It has dungeons, dragons, magnificent castles, evil wizards, close-call adventures and more; it takes you right where you want to go, but with a teeny bit extra... like the extra toffee you get from your grandma."
7091,1,"D&D is a delight that even those unfamiliar with the game will enjoy immensely. It's packed with enough action, laughs, and heart to entertain any family whose parents aren't still mired in a Satanic panic mindset."
7092,1,"“Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is an unexpectedly delightful, lighthearted, enchanting adventure. At its heart, the film encourages reluctant heroes to fight for fairness, equality, and justice."
7093,1,"A pleasant surprise. A great mixture of world building , humor, & action to make this one of the most entertain movies of the year."
7094,1,"Writer and director duo John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein (“Spider-Man: Homecoming”) and cowriter Michael Gilio execute well-worn tropes and platitudes in a lighthearted, heartwarming, satisfying way."
7095,1,"I went in with low-expectations, but was thoroughly charmed, partly because of the performances of Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, and Hugh Grant."
7096,1,Directors Jonathan M. Goldstein and John Francis Daley have used a balance of big action sequences with a continuous barrage of one-liners and sight gags to come up with a fun film.
7097,1,"Buckets of fun, with great performances and genuine laugh-out loud moments...there may be audiences rooting around for substance but similar a D&D game, they should just roll with it and enjoy themselves."
7098,1,Chris Pine is the MVP of an incredibly charming cast with such natural chemistry that the comedic moments become truly hilarious - the graveyard scene will be replayed over and over again.
7099,1,"A feast for the eyes, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” excels in not taking itself too seriously but allowing viewers to enjoy a fun experience."
7100,1,Brought back memories of my childhood when I would run around the playground and pretend I was a knight will all of my friends. A laugh out loud love letter to all geeks and nerds out there. The entire cast is great but Rodriguez steals the entire show!
7101,1,"It marks the return of the kind of blockbuster that rarely graces the silver screen today, one that grounds its awe-inspiring spectacle in sincerity and character."
7102,1,"In essence, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a crowdpleaser in the best of ways, resuscitating overplayed tropes with the right amount of thrills, humor, and heart."
7103,1,"The comedic route may not sit well with those expecting anything D&D related to be consistently serious. Yet, anyone who’s ever played a game, imaginary or video based, will know humor is as crucial to the whole experience as sheer skill."
7104,1,"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a perfectly imperfect movie made for the fans. It is an undeniable hoot and a half that, apart from the odd Owl Bear, will please most tabletop role-players."
7105,1,"With just the right mix of action, fantasy and humor delivered by characters that are impossible not to fall in love with it is easy to see why many cinema lovers will be calling for a sequel to be made as soon as possible."
7106,1,"The usual problem with adapting games into film is that there’s not enough plot to hang a story on (I’m looking at you, Angry Birds.) D&D is nothing but stories. Honor Among Thieves feels like something a dungeon master would cook up for a campaign."
7107,1,"""We're gonna make this fun."" ""Oh, but what's the added depth?"" ""No, no, no, shut up. Fun!"" I fell like we don't get that all that much anymore."
7108,0,"A generic adventure film that tries to wink so hard with its goofy, and mostly unfunny, quipping and then still tries to sell us on its more sincere moments when it is not namedropping objects as cameos."
7109,1,"Captures just the right blend of humor, thrills, fantasy, and lovable characters, and brisk storytelling, approximating the fun of a bunch of good pals playing the game."
7110,1,"From Pine’s delightful performance to the consistently effective humor, there’s little about D&D that doesn’t charm."
7111,1,"If you’ve been missing the sort of broadly sincere action-fantasy films we used to get in the Eighties, Honor Among Thieves is chaotic good."
7112,1,"Grant has a knack for portraying charming yet evil villains, and Forge is no exception."
7113,1,"Just like Goldstein and Daley found a way to transform a kidnapping story into one of the best comedies of 2018, as well as the decade, so have they made [D&D] something that cues tabletop newbs like myself to be excited to see what comes next."
7114,0,It’s not very funny and the whole meandering plot just felt kind of boring.
7115,1,A great time at the movies.
7116,1,Lavishly produced.
7117,1,"In a film world full of geek culture adaptations, Daley and Goldstein’s 2023 adaptation is the functional and rewarding film that Dungeons & Dragons fans have long awaited."
7118,1,"...takes its fantasy world seriously, but not itself."
7119,1,"It’s popcorn japery in fine form: Swords against sorcery, sorcery against monsters, monsters against swords, and around and around, while the charismatic cast slam-bangs the consistently amusing setup/one-liner dialogue..."
7120,1,Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great representation of how players imagine the games in their private spaces playing out.
7121,1,"Just like the game, the movie leaves you wanting more adventures, whether it's from this same cast or others in this world. It’s about time we got to see the magic of D&D on the big screen!"
7122,1,"Goldstein and Daley keep the jokes and the action running in tandem, and add just enough emotional weight — like Edgin’s concern for his daughter — to make it all not seem too frivolous."
7123,1,"If you didn’t know how to play Dungeons and Dragons before seeing the movie (subtitled “Honor Among Thieves”), you won’t after seeing it, either. But you can say you were entertained."
7124,1,"Ultimately, a big-hearted crowd-pleaser."
7125,0,Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves builds towards a typically exhausting climax that ensures it finishes on just about as underwhelming and interminable a note as one could possibly envision...
7126,1,"The story of a motley crew who dares to defeat a dangerous big bad is entertaining and likable, and worth watching not only for RPG fans. [Full review in Spanish]"
7127,1,"In Honour Among Thieves, odd moments of sincerity largely crumble in the face of amusement and outlandishness [...] It is by tapping into the very soul of Dungeons and Dragons that this film manages to stand proud as a worthy namesake."
7128,1,"Brings the game to life with a scent of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""
7129,1,"It’s all good fun, never makes the mistake of taking itself too seriously, and Hugh Grant does a fine line in oily baddies."
7130,1,"If you are looking for a fun movie to go watch this weekend that has great action, but isn’t too violent, and contains a lot of fun, then Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is definitely a must-see."
7131,1,It’s as though Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves made a smoothie with Spaceballs and The Avengers to a side-splitting effect.
7132,1,"A big-budget crowd-pleaser, it is well-cast, well-crafted and just plain fun, an old-school spectacle that makes a compelling case for sitting in the dark with a hundred or more strangers and just enjoying the show."
7133,1,It'll leave you wanting more. We deserve more!
7134,1,"Dungeons And Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a crowd pleasing, infinitely enjoyable and super FUN movie that never feels distant, heavy or inaccessible. Chris Pine provides a much needed wink and charm while Michelle Rodriguez kicks much ass in this one."
7135,1,"Silly, swaggering, swashbuckling screen adaptation of the popular, improvisational, role-playing, fantasy game. If you've never played D&D, learn a bit about it before you go."
7136,1,Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves uses CGI in many creative and funny ways. The effects lend themselves to the comedy.
7137,1,"""Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves"" is a lot of fun. A lot of fun. It's energetic, campy and full of action. Has Chris Pine ever been this enjoyable to watch? He's great. And no, you don't need to know a thing about D&D to enjoy this movie."
7138,0,A third-tier Lord of the Rings knockoff... [The material] just doesn't lend itself to a movie.
7139,1,“Dungeon & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is a fine film that delivers what the trailers promised. This fantasy action comedy is entertaining and left me content.
7140,1,"Pine is a gem, the surrounding cast are all strong, and the world is well-built. But the number one thing this writer-director team gets right is the understanding that both the game and popcorn movies are supposed to be FUN. There's a lot of fun here."
7141,1,"If you're a roleplayer who knows their Waterdeep from their Baldur's Gate, add another star to the rating. Everyone else, this is solid three-star fun and a welcome big-budget addition to the genre of cinematic fantasy."
7142,1,"…Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves proves itself to be a cut above most knuckle-headed, thud-and blunder sword and sorcery romps…"
7143,1,"Mostly, Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is enough of a romp — a romp with clear franchise-starting ambitions, even though there's already been three D&D movies dating back to 2000, but a romp nonetheless."
7144,1,"It's fun enough. And it does, in fact, have some dragons in it. And now that I think about it, I think I saw some dungeons as well. But don't quote me, which is a stupid thing to say within an actual quote on RT. Hey...it's late. I have to go to bed."
7145,0,"The source material is something that was built on imagination and creativity, which I didn’t sense much of in Honor Among Thieves, and I found the experience a bit mundane because of that."
7146,1,Entertaining for longtime tabletop players and those who've never rolled a D20.
7147,1,"An action adventure, with a solid script, stunning scenes, a championship cast and endearing performances; But above all with a powerful moral that gives the best level of entertainment for the whole family. Don't miss it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
7148,1,"Though it may struggle with pacing and an arbitrary villain, a trio of endlessly charming and deliciously ridiculous performances from Grant, Pine, and Page make Honor Among Thieves a worthy holder of the Dungeons & Dragons name."
7149,1,"The main reason this story is compelling is that the characters are complex and captivating. Edgin and Simon, in particular, are flawed, and are not naturally heroic. They just stubbornly keep trying to succeed and to be better."
7150,0,"Even more of a theme park movie than “Jungle Ride,” which was actually based on one...the cinematic equivalent of a mile-high roller-coaster ride with no other objective but to provide multiple jolts before screeching to an explosive halt."
7151,1,The only question is why it took so long to create a low-stakes but also highly amusing version of this long-running fan favorite.  Chris Pine was perfectly cast.
7152,1,"Dungeons and Dragons: Honour Among Thieves is a lot more fun than anticipated, and while the jokes often make the film soar, the comedown comes hard and fast with a narrative that holds no surprises."
7153,1,"Good old-fashioned, high fantasy fun."
7154,1,"A cinematic campaign that accomplishes its mission thanks to the masterful use of its weapons: Sharp script, solid performances, and magical spectacle. Although it didn’t completely steal my heart, D&D is Deliciously Delightful. [Full Review in Spanish]"
7155,1,"A solid romp that is charming enough to elide those concerns, crafting a personality that eludes a lot of other like-minded original fantasy films."
7156,1,"Even while it's relentlessly silly, and sometimes flat-out absurd, there's a warmly beating heart in here that grabs the viewer's affection."
7157,1,"If you would like to flex your imagination a little bit, this one’s a decent family entertainer with a well-crafted blend of comedy and heart."
7158,1,"I get why you might not think it’s for you. Do you like laughing? Well, then, I promise it’s for you."
7159,1,Humour makes a welcome return to the fantasy genre.
7160,1,"Honor Among Thieves is a rare franchise for its new faces, not overloading the mythology while introducing new characters with blind trust in an ensemble that works perfectly. [Full review in Spanish]"
7161,0,"A cheaper, chintzier version of this movie might have been as much fun as these actors appear to be having."
7162,1,"Clearly a work of love from its pair of directors, and it’s one of the best films of 2023..."
7163,1,"A superbly entertaining family film. The right amount of humour, adventure, charm, and heart"
7164,1,Better than I thought it would be! A good story and fun characters with pretty great visuals. A fun watch!
7165,1,"Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez have terrific buddy-movie chemistry in a fantasy film that deftly balances high-stakes action, warm drama and clever comedy."
7166,1,The camp tone is tongue-in-cheek and family-friendly – more Shrek than Assassin’s Creed. Homage and affectionate parody in equal parts...
7167,1,Directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley have pulled together an earnestly funny swords-and-sorcery film worth adventuring out to see.
7168,1,Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a rollicking great fantasy adventure.
7169,1,"Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is an absolute blast of a blockbuster. It sets out to entertain its audience, and completes that quest with wit and good cheer."
7170,1,"Honor Among Thieves probably isn't destined to make my top-10 list of 2023 movies, but much its two-hour and 14 minutes passed easily. Besides, the actors, notably Pine and Rodriguez, gave the movie enough heart, grit and humor to ward off negative vibes."
7171,0,The film is almost playing catch-up with itself.
7172,1,"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves defines overachieving as a cinematic experience that performs above expectations with impressive practical visual effects, an immersive fantasy world, and charming, likable underdog characters."
7173,1,You really can’t expect more from a film based on “Dungeons & Dragons” and this one delivers for the players and the curious.
7174,1,"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves never does anything truly surprising, but it has a lot of energy and enough craft and love for its genre to keep it entertaining."
7175,1,"Much of the enjoyment comes from simply hanging out with this ragtag group as they bop along to fantastical locales, encounter creatures of all kinds, and learn to work together in the process."
7176,1,They finally made a quality D&D film.
7177,1,"Reduced to a movie, D&D might merely seem like an ersatz version of Tolkien... Honor Among Thieves is certainly that, though its sense of playfulness lifts it above our large pile of geek fandom detritus."
7178,1,"It' s LORD OF THE RINGS meets MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, a damn good winning combo, with storytelling at the heights of an Indiana Jones adventure. All in all, it's an old-timey Saturday Matinee in one movie, with Chris Pine giving his top ""Pine."""
7179,1,"There’s nothing quite as fun as seeing a well-executed action-comedy with an audience, one that both inspires peals of laughter and those tense moments where you grab the chair in anticipation. ... Honor Among Thieves nails that sensibility."
7180,1,"To my surprise, I walked in a novice, but I walked out having the most fun at the movies this year."
7181,1,"Chris Pine is a genius bit of casting, because he not only brings goodwill but also his casual, unimposing swagger and a cheeky sense of frolic."
7182,1,An honorable reboot that understands the appeals of its brand and consistently presents them with charm and panache.
7183,1,"This is a movie that gently takes you by the hand and reminds you of all of the wild, silly, reasons you love high fantasy action books and movies. It’s a joyful tale with enough easter eggs for the hardcore fans without making new fans feel left out."
7184,1,"A very funny Chris Pine leads the cast that includes the always tough Michelle Rodriguez, while Hugh Grant gets to ham it up once again as the villain. Hasbro meets Monty Python meets The Princess Bride. It's loads of fun."
7185,1,"We probably have Strange Things 4 to thank for this revival, but if it has birthed a new film franchise, that’s no chore if each instalment is as colourful and good natured as this one."
7186,0,"A high-fantasy action comedy of tedious slapstick and obvious punchlines you scry the instant a wannabe medieval wag opens their mouth. It’s all borderline incoherent, sketched in cheap-looking CGI."
7187,1,"As Monjilla the Dragon Lady, I loved the dragon, but am doubtful about the Black and White diversity. Note that early on, the thieves pass a yurt to steal horses yet the presence of East Asians is low--one villain with few lines."
7188,1,"It’s got a great cast, lots of action, and there’s laughs, although I expected it to be a bit funnier. Both Smith and Regé-Jean Page were big stand outs. While it was a fun movie, I couldn’t get behind the pacing."
7189,0,Pig Killer comes off exploitive and wanting to shock which it fails at throughout.

7249,1,Fingernails has an intelligent central premise and is elevated by its leads who all share fantastic chemistry making their relationships believable. Ultimately some of its ideas feel half-baked.
7250,0,"Although the premise is perhaps more interesting than the film's execution, Fingernails is nonetheless a bittersweet take on romance that succeeds on the strength of the chemistry between its two lead actors."
7251,0,"Despite a talented cast, there's no way of getting around viewing this superficial film as anything but trash."
7252,0,The premise—that a new scientific test can definitively determine whether a couple is in love—is arguably more interesting than the narrative as a whole.
7253,1,"It’s an exceptional cast, and they fill out the premise with subtle inflections and authentic desire -- the romantic wins out."
7254,1,"I’m mixed-positive on Fingernails, but I’m absolutely recommending the film because of these terrific performers."
7255,0,Fingernails has an interesting concept that ultimately falls flat.
7256,0,"Charismatic and authentic performances aside, I kept waiting for Fingernails to just go for it, take the big swing, rush to the airport gates, and make the big speech, because surely that's better than waffling for this long."
7257,0,"Regrettably, the execution feels too slick and fabricated to convey authenticity, the romance comes across as feeble, and the emotions fail to reach the heart. Alas, I didn't buy a word of it."
7258,1,I think the main fault of this film is not much is explained. especially the technology that is supposed to measure compatibility... I did enjoy the acting but they needed to explain a lot more.
7259,0,"Nikou’s sci-fi drama is more failed experiment than a fine, or redefining, romance."
7260,1,"Fingernails is a cute enough film...If you are in the mood for something cute that does not require too much from you, or you want to fall in love with Riz Ahmed, then it’s worth a watch."
7261,1,"Fingernails won’t satisfy both hearts and minds at the level of its masterful predecessors, but Nikou has written and directed a moving, thought-provoking film."
7262,0,Fingernails relies on soft mood sand feelings without imbuing them with proper depth.
7263,0,"Fingernails has a preachy message about how love is inherently risky. With no emotional payoff, its inane and implausible plot points add up to a plodding, pompous film."
7264,1,The restrained performances reflect the emotional numbness of this life.
7265,0,"That provocative element is in those touches where it references other films... when our relationships don't seem to match what we see in those films, when the feelings aren't as strong or as definitive, that's when the doubt creeps in."
7266,0,"Despite reliable actors being engaging throughout, this movie lacks curiosity about its ideas to where I only grew more and more frustrated. It’s not a good sign that you don’t experience any feeling whatsoever watching this letdown of a film about love."
7267,1,A softer version of Yorgos Lanthimos’ The Lobster...
7268,1,"For all its whimsy, Fingernails is delicately profound. Its characters aren’t making bold romantic moves; they’re interrogating their assumptions of what is ultimately an unknowable phenomenon."
7269,0,There are a couple of amusing moments but the film never quite jells as either comedy or romance. I was ready for it to wrap things up a good half hour before the end.
7270,0,"Even its central physical provocation feels tame and held-back, as if to promise a genuinely challenging exploration of love that Nikou’s film can’t muster up the courage to actually become."
7271,1,"As science fiction goes, it is a look into the malfunctioning near future of our society. With an epidemic of loneliness gripping the country...I can see where the idea for “Fingernails” found its seed, but it still makes me wince."
7272,1,"This witty, tender film casts quite the spell, and Buckley and Ahmed are wonderful together."
7273,1,"“Fingernails” won’t be for all tastes, but I found this gracefully acted, lightly dusted sci-fi drama to be one of the most refreshing films about love in a while."
7274,1,"This cleverly offbeat affair might have its flat spots, but it does have plenty to say about the pressures people face in keeping relationships alive and nurturing. The ever-expressive Buckley, as always, reigns supreme in the lead role."
7275,1,"There is a missed opportunity here to have explored things about the process that Christos Nikou and his co-writers developed. I wanted a little bit more out of this film, but Fingernails is still worth a watch."
7276,0,"By not doing enough to explore the rules, that they’re ultimately broken by the characters feel romantically inert."
7277,1,"Nikou, like most of us, does not have the key to the secret [of love], but his film at least reflects, like any good mirror, that feeling of fragility that fills us when we consider the object of our desire... [Full review in Spanish]"
7278,1,Greek director Christos Nikou and his co-screenwriters Sam Steiner and Stavros Raptis make some intriguing propositions in their screenplay... But what their script lays the foundations for are some exceptional performances from the trio of leads.
7279,0,"As a critic, I've seen wretched sci-fi romantic dramadies - but few as ludicrous and repugnant as this...Jeremy Allen White's & Riz Ahmed's roles are so superficial and Jesse Buckley wears a garish hairstyle/fright wig. Why?"
7280,1,"Just when you think 'Fingernails' is ready to divulge the answer to what it feels about the game of love and the roles we play, it pulls back and elects for ambiguity."
7281,1,"This refreshingly honest take on relationships with a unique sci-fi edge rests squarely on the shoulders of Jessie Buckley, Riz Ahmed, and Jeremy Allen White in one of the more compelling love triangles put on film."
7282,1,"Despite the incredible cast, the chemistry between the leads, and the premise, Fingernails suffers at the hands of pacing."
7283,0,"While it might provoke thought-provoking conversations about love in the modern era and the nature of relationships, the high-concept, deadpan rom-com from the Lanthimos protegee contains little insight and intuition."
7284,0,"The more you think about this alternative world, the more the conceit loses its shape, until the film is taking a poke at only the most lukewarm romantic expectations."
7285,1,"I’d happily watch Buckley and Ahmed read the phone book; they both possess the kind of pensive eyes and ambiguous half-smiles that serve as catnip to funny-sad auteurs. But, like Anna, you can’t help but want a bit more eventually, too."
7286,0,"Fingernails appears to be arguing for people to cast aside their attachments to technology and embrace the uncertainty that comes with following their hearts, but this is a long way to go simply get people to delete Tinder from their phones."
7287,1,"It’s an interesting premise, the performances are strong and it’s a tight, disciplined story that doesn’t tangent off. But it can feel a little cold even though the always wonderful Jessie Buckley has good chemistry with Riz Ahmed."
7288,0,"The chemistry is certainly there in the form of Jessie Buckley and Riz Ahmed. But the accompanying physics are absent, as Nikou and his co-writers struggle to exert gravity on a conceit so light and airy it repeatedly threatens to float away."
7289,0,"In Triple Frontier, the ‘plot’ aspects of the screenplay work well, but when the characters driving that plot are not fully-formed and layered, it seeps through."
7290,1,"...just when you think you have it figured out, it throws an unexpected but welcomed curveball."
7291,0,"Chandor and Boal’s collaboration on Triple Frontier is the first blemish on their practically pristine resumes; a generic, by-the-numbers heist thriller camouflaged with a false social consciousness."
7292,0,"A lot of talent has been assembled for what amounts to a modest pleasure, and that cannot help but feel disappointing."
7293,0,Episode 35: Triple Frontier / Climax / Black Mother / Transit
7294,1,"It might be a premise that's been done to death, but with a fantastic ensemble cast and a series of unexpected twists and turns - with one in particular sure to leave you shell-shocked - this one's well worth its ""weight in gold."""
7295,1,A timely and heartfelt message deftly delivered.
7296,1,"Triple Frontier is as good a crime thriller as any movie fan could want, and one that demonstrates that Netflix is staking its claim as one of the premier movie studios."
7297,1,The strong cast is able to bring enough shadings to their character types to keep our interest and a surprising third act make this a winner.
7298,0,I am bored when I see the anonymous heroes punished by the mechanisms of insignificant patriotism and the wildest capitalism. [Full review in Spanish]
7299,0,"On the one hand proving that Netflix is attracting top directors (J.C. Chandor), writers (Mark Boal) and actors (Ben Affleck), while on the other hand presenting a sweeping action-adventure that's reduced on a small screen."
7300,1,The team's synergy is what keeps us connected.
7301,0,Triple Frontier stumbles at the finish line.
7302,1,"Even if the characters' self-righteousness is a bit unconvincing, that's part of the point."
7303,1,Triple Frontier borrows The Treasure of Sierra Madre's plot but lacks John Huston's fortitude to analyze and rightly judge the mercenaries.
7304,1,"Chandor teases the possibility of a sequel at the very last, but if this team decide to head back for part two there's quite a bit of work to be done to make it worthwhile."
7305,0,Poor Affleck mostly hangs in the background while Hunnam and Hedlund do their weird flexing. Ben Affleck ends up being the least-grating actor in the ensemble.
7306,1,"For some reason, Triple Frontier's militarized masculinity works-in the way old Westerns worked."
7307,0,There are at least three or four good films buried within Triple Frontier but they went with the surface level stuff and called it a day.
7308,1,Offers some nice surprises and while it doesn't end in the way you might expect it's an entertaining action drama.
7309,0,Utterly generic time-killer thriller.
7310,1,"Triple Frontier is a tense, exciting and dramatic action thriller that takes a fairly basic concept and executes it very well."
7311,1,"A macho, run-and-gun character study about what happens to the men who fight for this country and its interests when they leave the service and how little they're compensated relative to the sacrifices they make"
7312,1,"Director [JC] Chandor, in his projects so far, has explored how humans deal with their relationship with the money. Triple Frontier is no exception. This aspect is the strongest character in this intense movie."
7313,1,"This isn't a home-run for the heist genre, but it's solid. I got what I wanted out of this film."
7314,1,"I didn't expect too much from Triple Frontier. I can underestimate Netflix movies all I want, but J.C. Chandor uses this film to show me, and the world, that he's truly a force to be reckoned with, and I'll be damned if I second guess him again."
7315,1,Triple Frontier is nothing if not aggressively competent.
7316,1,"Still, while it may be a tad uneven, Triple Frontier manages to maintain the audience's interest for its two hour running time."
7317,1,Triple Frontier is a no-holds-barred action epic with high stakes and major thrills.
7318,0,Triple Frontier looks and feels like a Stallone/Schwarzenegger film resurrected from the'90s.
7319,1,"The sequences that take place in the jungle, the plane's crash landing or the shooting in the mountain provide the necessary doses of good entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
7320,0,"If you're a fan of the heist genre, it doesn't hurt to give this a try. If not, skip it."
7321,1,A heaping plate of meat-and-potatoes comfort food. It's the kind of movie you talk about with your dad.
7322,1,Triple Frontier goes beyond the heist adventure
7323,0,"the characters are all standard types who never cut much beneath the surface, which renders the suspense superficial, rather than emotional"
7324,0,With Chandor doubling as director the movie looks great but makes surprisingly little of the personal conflicts that arise.
7325,1,"When watching, pretend that Affleck's character is a retired Batman forced to sell condos."
7326,1,"Though Triple Frontier takes a while to reach the right heightened levels of tension, confusion and aggression promised by Santiago's semi-suicide mission, it does indeed get there in the end."
7327,1,"The film's attempts at multiple genres may not blend together into a seamless whole, yet the talented cast and strong direction by Chandor help to raise it above its flaws."
7328,1,"Exciting, suspenseful action tale with violence, profanity."
7329,1,"A solid, if occasionally clumsy take on the ""big heist goes sideways"" genre. Gets a little credit for not being quite as troop porny as these kinds of movies usually are."
7330,0,"Alas, just as broken clocks have their moments of accuracy, even the most gifted directors occasionally offer up disappointments. Such is the case with J.C. Chandor's fourth film, Triple Frontier."
7331,1,'Triple Frontier' should be prime fodder for heist movie fans. There's hardly a dull moment in director J. C. Chandor's film about the unexpected consequences of a jungle robbery.
7332,1,"The movie struggles because it cannot keep up momentum. It stalls out after the actual heist, which could reasonably find its way into the pantheon of fun action sequences."
7333,0,We've had this film before. This one just happens to be a more uninspiring and less-than-thrilling version of this particular trope of action films.
7334,1,"Triple Frontier doesn't entirely manage to transcend the traps of action movie, but there's more to it than meets the eye."
7335,1,Chandor somehow takes the machismo of '80s action movies and inserts the moral compass of the 21st century.
7336,1,"Technically profound, yet dense thematically, it's the kind of film that requires a concentrating, engaged audience, which is a harder sell on Netflix than at a crowded movie theater."
7337,1,This very good analysis of American imperialism and its devastatingly insidious effects on the individuals it ensnares into its web is frustratingly only about half of Triple Frontier.
7338,1,"Triple Frontier is the lowest point in JC Chandor's filmography, without becoming a mediocre result. [Full review in Spanish]."
7339,0,"The film feels false in presenting a solid friendship between [the characters]: With men of that ilk, can anything good be expected? [Full review in Spanish]"
7340,1,The fourth film by J.C. Chandor shows that the director has a good eye for action. [Full review in Spanish]
7341,0,"Uniquely for Chandor, we've seen it all before."
7342,1,"Oscar Isaac, Ben Affleck, Charlie Hunnam, Garrett Hedlund and Pedro Pascal. Oh, were you looking for review points as well?"
7343,1,Triple Frontier is not a waste of your time exactly -- it's a good film to curl up with on Netflix -- but Chandor surely has better movies ahead of him.
7344,0,"Nothing offered by Triple Frontier is new to its genre, unless it is the exceptional meaninglessness of its central conflict that refuses to justify the stakes it begs for."
7345,1,The film focuses on the characters and their human dilemmas and turns the fable of the theft of money into a reflection on the limits of actions and their consequences. [Full Review in Spanish]
7346,1,Triple Frontier works as a hybrid of a quasi-journalistic high-brow military drama and a low-brow men-on-a-mission film.
7347,1,An epic personalist and chauvinist film. [Full Review in Spanish]
7348,0,"Triple Frontier could have been a good film instead of the brutal, rigged mess it turned out to be."
7349,1,Triple Frontier makes a decent stab at looking beyond the usual ambitions of the genre. There's thought behind all this gun-toting.
7350,1,"Triple Frontier features impeccable photography, strong acting, and well-staged action scenes that ooze tension."
7351,1,"Comprised so completely of seething, wordless manfeels and tension-breaking affectionate bros before things-that-are-not-bros sarcastic machismo that your media player might as well start emitting the vague scent of leather polish and rich mahogany."
7352,1,"The Netflix-produced thriller has plenty of shoot-'em-up action, but it's the accounting that will leave you breathless."
7353,0,"The well-made but frustrating Triple Frontier, which takes its title from the intersection of the borders of Brazil, Peru and Colombia, has almost everything going for it but depth, focus and gravitas."
7354,1,"From Isaac to Hunnam, [the actors] invest their characters with richer human qualities than the story probably required."
7355,1,There are some great action sequences in the script.
7356,1,"Every performance is solid, and you'll be on the edge of your seat, even if you (hopefully) don't buy into the film's moral code."
7357,0,J.C. Chandor turns an intensely physical narrative into another of his inadvertently generic studies of procedure.
7358,0,"A movie about super-soldiers going up against the odds might have been formulaic, but it would have been more interesting than this one, which is about tough-talking incompetents."
7359,0,'Triple Frontier' gets a lot right so it's hard to see why it doesn't quite work.
7360,1,J.C. Chandor is probably my favorite director of actors working at the moment.
7361,1,"Though unevenly scripted, Triple Frontier makes good on its grizzled ensemble cast, led by J.C. Chandor's robust direction."
7362,0,"There are some zippy chase scenes and shootouts, and tension throughout. But the characters - especially the lethargic Affleck - make for more of a C-Team than an A-Team."
7363,1,"Intense and supremely well made, ""Triple Frontier"" also benefits from nuanced work from Ben Affleck and Oscar Isaac."
7364,1,I'm a bit of sucker for this kind of material and Triple Frontier -- which wisely places its robbery about midway through -- earns passing grades.
7365,1,"It's an easily watchable picture, though, particularly with Isaac - who has ascended from quite-good to excellent in recent years - in the lead."
7366,1,"Triple Frontier never achieves the nightmarish insanity that the premise promises [...] but maybe we're getting a little greedy. This is fun, muscular filmmaking."
7367,1,"If you're into stories about brotherhood, heists, and survival this is a good one to press play on."
7368,1,J.C. Chandor's weakest film so far is saved by an excellent cast. [Full review in Spanish]
7369,1,"There's a meta-narrative in there somewhere, condemning films like Triple Frontier for exploiting the violence of war for superficial ends, but Chandor doesn't delve into self-analysis long enough to make a point about it."
7370,1,The talented cast elevates a decidedly average plot to one that is worth catching.
7371,0,"The movie is really just one big lagging metaphor, which is why it comes across as so generic ."
7372,0,Five leading men head into the jungle with $$ in their eyes. Not all of them return.
7373,1,"It's as if a much younger Schwarzenegger, Stallone and Willis had gathered together and shot one of their own [films], but with less humor and sadism. [Full review in Spanish]"
7374,1,"It's the thinking man's action movie, as long as that man doesn't want to think too hard."
7375,1,They make quite the team - the newest member should be you.
7376,1,"Despite lacking a profound drama, the film works as entertainment. [Full Review in Spanish]"
7377,1,"If you dig shoot-'em-up sequences, ""Triple Frontier"" has plenty and they're often the default. Yet what it does well - though not enough - is introduce the complicated motivations of characters and what's led them to this somewhat impossible mission."
7378,1,"The idea to cast Hedlund and Hunnam as brothers is downright brilliant - if Boyd Holbrook were in this film, it'd be like looking at triplets."
7379,1,The element of surprise has largely disappeared from modern mainstream moviemaking. And one of Triple Frontier's greatest accomplishments is how confidently it topples the expectations of a wary and weathered audience.
7380,1,"On a surface level, TRIPLE FRONTIER is an action thriller that provides teeth gritting scenes that cause the palms to get a bit sweaty. To call this film intense is an understatement, but Boal's script just barely scratches the psyche of these guys."
7381,1,Crime doesn't pay!
7382,0,"While the action itself is vividly shot and often quite tense, the characters are so thinly drawn that it's impossible to connect with them, much less care about whether they make a clean getaway with their stolen millions."
7383,1,"An impressive, adult-driven action thriller. Terrifically cast and acted, impeccably directed."
7384,0,"Director J.C. Chandor's go-big-or-go-home heist film finds its footing for a little while amid a perversely engrossing explosion of opportunity costs. But the rest of this mas-macho meathead stuff just seems simultaneously beneath, and beyond, him."
7385,1,All is well because Chandor has a way of keeping the action scenes enthralling.
7386,1,"Triple Frontier says some things about society not valuing veterans enough, about contemporary masculinity and the code of the warrior. While that may not sound very original, it's done in an original way..."
7387,0,"It's an intriguing, then bemusing, sometimes unintentionally amusing blend."
7388,1,"Triple Frontier is a tense, dramatic thriller buoyed by a handful of strong performances and a fascinating screenplay by Mark Boal."
7389,1,"The Exorcist: Believer asks us not to put our faith in any specific dogma but rather in people, in love, and in the fact that your neighbor is experiencing pain, and no matter what you believe, THAT is real."
7390,1,"The outcome is a qualified success – a horror feature that tries to say something profound about good and evil, love and faith, but ultimately creeps around the edges of these big topics."
7391,0,"Believer is a poorly edited-together combination of ideas that had potential. The film starts out as a haunting mystery, but it slowly morphs into an empty and unnecessary sequel."
7392,0,This occasionally jump-scary homage fails to break any new ground.
7393,0,"There are moments in this borderline incoherent mess of a movie in which fans may be convinced that its sole purpose is to try making the original follow-up, 1977’s legendarily godawful Exorcist II: The Heretic, look positively genius by comparison."
7394,0,"Congrats to the filmmaking team, I guess: they might have made some utter, contemptible trash, but at least it's not lazy trash."
7395,0,They need to stop making Exorcist movies. We don't need any more!
7396,0,"This was completely unnecessary. The rules were never clear and the various character actions, particularly the lead's, made no sense."
7397,0,This is not a good movie and it's even more offensive because the cast is stacked. Not sure how this misfire happened but really hoping we don't get a sequel to this...
7398,1,"As he did with 'Halloween' (2018), director David Gordon Green pays homage to a 1970s classic with just enough new touches to bring it up to date. 'The Exorcist: Believer' may be unnecessary, but it's mostly entertaining."
7399,0,"The film has good performances, some interesting themes - especially for people of faith - and even a relatively credible drama. Where it fails, unfortunately, is in terms of originality, and more importantly, HORROR. Full review in Spanish."
7400,0,"The Exorcist is now 50 years old, and luring Burstyn back isn’t enough to render this retread fresh."
7401,1,An okay movie that I think will become more appreciated over the years as it isn’t the worst that this series has delivered fans.
7402,0,"Despite haunting makeup, practical/visual effects, and editing, the screenwriters fail to take creative risks that would elevate the story."
7403,0,The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world to keep making bad Exorcist sequels.
7404,0,"Considering Green's lousy track record with horror properties, perhaps it’s time to perform an exorcism on his career in hopes of salvaging some semblance of a bright future."
7405,0,...a half-baked sequel that squanders its massive potential.
7406,1,"50 years after Friedkin's masterpiece, the most basic and accessible triumph of this sequel by David Gordon Green is that it isn't a total disaster. [Full review in Spanish]"
7407,0,"If it has ""Exorcist"" in the title then  it had better be scary. This wasn't."
7408,0,The Exorcist: Believer is a plain film in both its intention and its execution. Green's attempt to connect this mediocre exorcism film with the 1973 horror classic is a miserable farce.
7409,0,"You need more than head-twisting, jumpcuts, and platitudes about faith to make for a compelling paranormal horror in the same vein as The Exorcist; Believer isn’t even in the same country."
7410,0,Any resemblance between “The Exorcist” and “The Exorcist: Believer” is purely intentional.
7411,0,David Gordon Green and Co continue to bog down beloved horror franchises with poor story-telling and bloated casts of characters that only further water down the underwhelming arcs of Green’s main characters.
7412,1,"Group-think and nostalgia worked against The Exorcist: Believer, with many already wanting to dislike it. Yet, the movie delivers genuine terror, an expansion on possession lore, and a story with a lot of heart."
7413,1,"A rock solid first half -- character-driven, strong build of dread, and successful at conveying the sheer terror of watching a loved one, especially a child, slip away & feeling helpless in the fight to get them back. But then it becomes a forced sequel."
7414,0,"More of a shrug than an outright abomination, The Exorcist: Believer wastes so much potential, which almost makes it worse than even the franchise's worst entries. At least they tried to do something different."
7415,0,This is a lazy cash-grab that relies too much on goodwill from its 50 year old predecessor and has way too many characters. Most annoying is how Believer doesn't have anything new to say about religion; it certainly isn't transgressive or audacious.
7416,0,The most grievous sin committed by The Exorcist: Believer is how rank dull it all is.
7417,0,Let the power of the critic compel you to skip this movie.
7418,0,There's no point in bringing these classics back from the dead when they are already startlingly alive.
7419,0,I don't know how you could not just laugh at this film. Truly one of the worst films of the year.
7420,0,"50 years removed and filmmakers still think the original worked because of pea soup, head-twisting and vulgarities instead of the terrifying internal struggle of believing in the forces for good and evil. David Gordon Green's is the worst of the lot."
7421,0,"Believer won’t satisfy your need to scream. The fright level is low. The movie poster is scarier. The ending was the best, but not necessarily because it was over"
7422,0,An unholy disaster.
7423,0,"The Exorcist: Believer, a new legacy-quel to the 1973 horror landmark, is well acted, but so what?.. That’s only a tragedy in the sense that Green has shown us he’s an honest-to-God auteur with something to say. But he isn’t saying much of anything here."
7424,1,"Offers nothing new to the formula. And if you were worried Believer wouldn’t play the hits during the exorcism, fear not. It’s all there, and fans of the original will know to what we are referring."
7425,0,About as circumstantial as a used Band-Aid stuck to the floor of a public pool.
7426,0,"Never mind that it's all but impossible to figure out just what the film is trying to say with the exorcism, but it is so thoroughly devoid of any internal logic or basic storytelling competence that I can't explain what happened even if I wanted to."
7427,0,"The result is something that feels neutered of its power, banking on nostalgia to mask a weak-kneed retread that's never able to justify its own reason for being."
7428,0,David Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer fundamentally misunderstands its source material and has nothing of any real substance to say.
7429,0,"The film seems like too much of a rehash of things we’ve seen before. And, despite the obvious effort involved, it still, ultimately, is a bummer."
7430,0,"The film’s latter half lacked substance. The narrative didn’t offer us enough opportunities to resonate with the story or characters, so the emotional impact was diluted when revelations unfolded."
7431,0,It got some jump scares and that's fun... but not much else.
7432,1,"[Burstyn's] presence anchors this film to the heft of that brand name, and elevates a film that is otherwise comme ci, comme ca."
7433,0,"Designed as a direct sequel to the 1973 classic, this is merely pointless freak-out horror, technically adept at creating impressive visuals but never coming close to the underlying themes that make the first film so indelible."
7434,0,There are samples of formulaic movies that don't result in anything good and The Exorcist: Believer is a dramatic example that it could even be worse. [Full review in Spanish]
7435,0,"It never gets close to recreating the miasmic chill of William Friedkin’s 1973 classic, or generating any fresh frights of its own."
7436,1,"However, overall this is a surprisingly class act, with enough devil in the detail to thoroughly enjoy."
7437,0,"[The Exorcist: Believer] has the same solemnity as the 18-certificate original — and brings back one of its stars, Ellen Burstyn — but the sense of evil isn’t there."
7438,0,...  To tackle a prestige project that’s steeped in Christian iconography and biblical allusions by simply defanging it with kindness is beyond pointless.
7439,0,I award this piece of garbage a Zero out of 5 possible stars. There was a day when the prospect of a David Gordon Green film would have me excited. Now...I get scared for all the wrong reasons with his name on a film.
7440,1,"That depiction of a particular kind of horror story is extremely well done, but actually, the film loses its way as the supernatural dimension builds, culminating in an extravagantly overwrought exorcism scene."
7441,0,"... The direct references to the landmark that has brought us here seem interesting, but the film results in a pastiche of reflections of the past filtered by the contemporary optics of the industry. [Full review in Spanish]"
7442,1,"Although an imperfect film with good ideas that are not always well executed, it is appreciated that [Believer] goes for a mix between the suggested and the explicit in which the former wins over the latter... [Full review in Spanish]"
7443,1,"Odom Jr. shines in his performance as a man who will stop at nothing to keep his daughter safe, in a sequel the slowly builds up towards an explosive conclusion."
7444,0,"The same inspirational greeting-card sentimentality about “healing” that induced unkind laughter in Halloween Ends surfaces here, just as awkwardly."
7445,1,"There’s enough here to make it all hold together, even if it’s starting to fray at the edges by the end. “The Exorcist: Believer” is not a new supernatural horror classic, but it is a solid, spooky time at the movies."
7446,0,"Because Green has always been a talented director, bits and pieces of “Believer” work effectively before the movie decides serious issues of belief, evil and the widening social divide in America must take a back seat to a screeching sound mix."
7447,1,Respectful – and suitably scary – continuation of the mythos.
7448,0,"David Gordon Green's direct sequel to the 1973 classic starts off promising and has genuinely terrifying moments, but towards the end moves into bad sequel territory."
7449,0,Not that entertaining.
7450,0,"The United Colors of Benneton angle is so overplayed, on the way out of the theater a pal said he wished they’d gone all the way and brought in a Hare Krishna to help."
7451,0,"This is a huge waste of a very talented cast, and another very low low in this franchise. If you were hoping for scares, something to root for, or something at least moderately interesting, this is not the movie for you."
7452,0,David Gordon Green needs to be stopped.
7453,0,The power of Christ compels you to not see this direct sequel to “The Exorcist” (1973).
7454,0,While the first half is pretty strong it starts to fall off once it becomes a legacy sequel forcing a connection to the original. The film tackles some cool ideas but never fully fleshes them out.
7455,0,"It requires a rare ineptitude to take what is famously one of the most terrifying movies ever made, recycle pretty much everything (including Tubular Bells on the score) but neglect to include the scares."
7456,0,It is very clear that the themes William Peter Blatty established in the original Exorcist is beyond the comprehension of director David Gordon Green.
7457,0,"The Exorcist: Believer had a lot of things going for it. They gave the director (David Gordon Green) several balls, and he dropped all of them."
7458,0,"'The Exorcist: Believer' offers two demonic possessions for the price of one, but less than half the scares of the original."
7459,0,"Much like David Gordon Green’s recent Halloween trilogy, the filmmaker’s attempt to resurrect The Exorcist franchise with The Exorcist: Believer is wildly ambitious. It is also pretty much guaranteed to be equally polarizing."
7460,1,"Somehow, the film's all-star makeup crew turns both possessed girls into eerily creepy reminders of Linda Blair's all-time bedeviled victim. Maybe even more scary is how seamlessly 90-year-old Ellen Burstyn returns as heroic mom Chris MacNeil."
7461,0,"Apparently, the director is already at work on two sequels. My request is simple: please shelve them. There’s nothing in The Exorcist: Believer that makes me want to revisit this world again."
7462,0,"The first hour of The Exorcist Believer is a decent Exorcist movie (...) And then, the rest of the movie happens and destroys all the goodwill that it had generated in that first half."
7463,1,Fans of the original film should embrace the fact that Green has entwined the two plots so well but on the other hand the film feels like it runs too long and brings nothing new to the exorcism sub-genre.
7464,1,"The Exorcist: Believer preaches more to the converted than to new recruits; the sense of faux religious conviction which was the strongest point of the series is drowned out in a flurry of Halloween-cake make-up, geysers of vomit and easily snapped necks."
7465,1,"The young actresses impressively sell their possessed characters; dead stares, ominous movements and menacing line delivery to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up – even if the devil’s profanity is a lot tamer this time around."
7466,0,They threw out the playbook. The iconic original had one thing not easily achieved- MENACE. It was more important then the head spinning.
7467,0,"Regardless of its intentions as a reverential follow-up, the film doesn’t possess nearly the same ability to provoke or frighten."
7468,0,"The Exorcist: Believer does not dazzle, does not leave a mark. [Full review in Spanish]"
7469,0,"Exorcist: Believer is possible the most cynical and lazy attempt I've seen at cashing in on a beloved movie's legacy. Forcing in a bizarre and wasted cameo and a few mentions of ""Regan"" is all that differentiates this from the dozens of Exorcist ripoffs."
7470,0,"The Exorcist: Believer fails to install a crisis of faith, which is the key to this universe.  [Full review in Spanish]"
7471,0,"The Exorcist: Believer possesses none of the thrills, scares, or originality that made The Exorcist such a big deal, spewing the pea soup to the proverbial curb and dialing down on scares that won't convert most viewers to fans."
7472,1,"Exorcist: Believer is never boring, but by the time it's over it feels a bit hollow. That still puts it behind Exorcist III and the TV series but at least the franchise is back on the right path."
7473,1,"Green doesn’t quite have the verve or creative ability to pull off the subtlety that made the original Exorcist an enduring classic. However, the ideas he’s exploring here are admirable."
7474,0,"It’s largely a testament to an almost-50-year-old movie that The Exorcist: Believer delivers so few proper scares, even with an extensive modern-CGI budget and the enthusiastic support of its studio, Universal."
7475,0,"It tries some interesting things, but murky cinematography and an unfocused plot fails to live up to the better films in the series."
7476,0,"While we get why Green’s film doesn’t indulge, we would have loved to see more freaky gross moments and backwards crab walking."
7477,0,I wouldn’t bet against some future boffin declaring this latest episode an underappreciated classic. It meets all the requirements: it’s terrible; many will certainly fail to appreciate it.
7478,1,"While the elegantly crafted, head-swiveling sequel fails to reach new heights, it delivers on suspense and jump scares, uplifted by returning original cast member Ellen Burstyn, 90!"
7479,1,"As a film, it’s at best serviceable, stronger in its world-building than in its climactic exorcism and nowhere near as unnerving as the original."
7480,1,"A worthy sequel the maintains the thematic validity of its ancestor, but on its own path. [Full review in Spanish]"
7481,0,"While The Exorcist: Believer is easily the best of David Gordon Green's horror exercises, it still doesn't hold a candle to the original, or to most current horror offerings."
7482,0,"After 50 years, The Exorcist has been revisited in various formats, and perhaps the most fitting way to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary would be to leave it undisturbed."
7483,0,"It’s only been two months since William Friedkin passed away, but I fully expect him to rise from the grave and give David Gordon Green a beating for The Exorcist: Believer."
7484,0,The build-up to the dual exorcism is so terrible it’s almost funny...
7485,0,"Most notably, it fails to be even remotely scary. While there’s only two attempted jump scares, the main disappointment is the portrayal of the possessions. The title event gets very limited screen time and what is depicted is not noteworthy."
7486,0,"I’ve pretty much lost faith in the franchise, and I suspect the two planned follow-ups are now in jeopardy. But as my twelve-year-old self was back in 1973, I’ll be planted in a theater seat when The Exorcist: Deceiver comes out in 2025, God willing."
7487,1,"While Green did a fine job with the overall look and feel of the film and some great jump scares, will this ever touch the original? Of course not. But it does provide some seasonal scares and is fun to see on the big screen with a lively audience."
7488,1,"While ""Believer"" has its flaws and really didn’t wow me the way ""Halloween 2018"" did, I still found it fascinating."
7489,1,A scandalously entertaining movie where blood is spilled like beer at a bachelor's party... [Full review in Spanish]
7490,0,Nazi-killing has never felt so frustratingly dull.
7491,1,"Sisu is unadulterated, grindhouse fun, and I for one hope we see more films like it very soon."
7492,1,"Sisu offers a 91-minute massacre with deftly captured shots and wonderfully skilled action pieces, delivering heaps of blood-drenched fun. If Violent Night’s Santa had a Finnish cousin, it would be Sisu’s badass Aatami Korpi."
7493,1,"As long as you're not hung up on things like whether a body used as a human shield can stop .50 caliber rounds, or if one can suck oxygen from a sliced trachea, and if you enjoy Nazis being exterminated (and who doesn't?), Sisu may very well be your jam."
7494,1,"We know by now that messing with a man who has lost his family and has a legendary nick name is a bad idea (he also owns a dog, and yes, the Nazis try to kill it), so we sit back for the blood bath, something Sisu delivers in buckets."
7495,1,"“Sisu” is gritty, blatant, bloody action cinema. It is a reckoning for sins that can never be exonerated and must never be forgotten. It is poetic vengeance delivered with lean, masterful precision."
7496,1,This is what would happen if Quentin Tarantino had ever directed a Clint Eastwood western.
7497,1,"It's all very silly, but it's so over-the-top that it becomes blissfully entertaining."
7498,1,The plot is so concentrated. It’s haiku with machineguns.
7499,1,"What a brilliant role this is for Tommila, a crusty old man with the unkillable quality of Keanu Reeves' John Wick...  with the inventiveness for killing with whatever is at hand of Liam Neeson's Taken character Brian Mills."
7500,1,"Sisu is many things, just like the term itself in its native Finland — and impossible to stop watching is one of them."
7501,1,Writer-director Jalmari Helander’s blood-and-guts revenge fantasy is the history revision you never knew you needed.
7502,1,Most movies would benefit from having more scenes where Nazis are mercilessly mowed down. This movie would benefit from having anything in addition to that.
7503,1,"Rather than being directed to avert your gaze from the effects of violence, you’re watching it magnified to the point of the cartoonish. It’s lavishly embellished with blood and gore. Talk about a guilty pleasure."
7504,1,"Helander’s particular interests seem to be in showcasing extravagant, gory kills, considering the film is one overtly long chase sequence."
7505,1,With its very attractive running time – why have so many films drifted from this once-standard length? – Sisu chalks up as an enjoyable wartime adventure that offers a feast for war movie buffs who adore the sight of WW2 German military hardware.
7506,1,"At 90 minutes it gets the job done and then some with a minimum of messing about. If Finland wants to be the home of thrilling pulp action, they're off to a rip-roaring start."
7507,1,"Helander knows this film’s tone isn’t your typical war movie where existential horror and sadness are the order of the day. Instead, the fire and blood splatters shine brightly, and the melodrama of violence is played for straight enjoyment."
7508,1,"Those folks who support the currently popular meme “In All Of History, It’s Never The Good Guys Banning Books” should get a cathartic charge out of this rousing action yarn in which scores of petty fascists get taken down a peg or 10."
7509,1,"A Great Throwback, old days of action films that contain great serialized action filmed in fun way."
7510,1,Keep your expectations in check and you’ll have light fun with this bloody WWII western about a scarred man trying to Finnish what he started.
7511,1,"Sisu is not for the faint of heart, but if you can stomach it, it's a well-made film worthy of your time."
7512,1,"Where the John Wick films are elegant in their choreography and steeped in genteel concepts of violence like duels with pistols at dawn, Sisu is gritty and brutal like a rabbit punch to the kidney."
7513,1,Compelling shots throughout however there were no emotional tie-ins for me to care about his survival.
7514,1,It had a charming brutality to it.
7515,1,Sisu is as good as you’ve heard – bring extra popcorn.
7516,1,"The simplicity of the plot, teamed with superb creative choices from [the filmmakers], meld together well, making this a real treat to watch."
7517,1,"It's hard to conceive of a film as purely, gratuitously enjoyable as this one; even if you don't particularly like grisly cinema, it feels like Sisu could win you over."
7518,1,"Styled as a midnight movie, Sisu makes terrific use of limited military hardware and a forbidding Lapland landscape. In common with 1980s actioners, there’s additional fun to be had treating gaping injuries on Tommila’s hardened, wiry physique."
7519,0,It is saddening when the dispensing of Nazis becomes so repetitive once the film finally gets back to doing the job from all the downtime in-between.
7520,1,"For all the pleasure viewers may take in the sight of nameless Nazis being dispatched and dismembered, they may be surprised by the film’s solemnity, too."
7521,1,"Divided into comic-book style chapters that help lighten the tone, and wearing its spaghetti western heart on its very bloody sleeves, this is popcorn gore at its absurdly enjoyable finest."
7522,1,"Infused with an absurd sense of irony, the film is also outrageous enough to become a cult classic."
7523,1,"The gory action and threadbare characterisation won’t be for everyone, but Sisu does what it sets out to do. This One-Man Army spectacular is sure to become a cult hit, and a sequel wouldn’t be unwelcome either."
7524,1,Sometimes all you want is a grizzled Finnish gold prospector relentlessly slaughtering cartoon evil Nazis in a variety of inventive and messy ways.
7525,1,Sisu is a true-blue B-movie with no greater purpose than indulging fantasies of dispatching sneering and terminally stupid fascist scumf—s from this mortal coil.
7526,1,"This crisp, sharp, unashamed film is a pot of gold."
7527,1,"This rather myopically nationalistic film glories in Korpi’s mass kills and miraculous escapes, which become ever more absurd, but Helander’s outrageous action romp is never afraid to laugh at itself."
7528,0,"Helander directs with verve and blood-drenched efficiency. The repetition, however, eventually becomes tiresome."
7529,1,... The film sets out to translate in cinematic form what it presents as stoicism of the hardest core: implacable will extended into stone-faced comedy.
7530,0,"It is handsomely filmed with a suitably menacing score and is economical, moving briskly from one set-piece to the next.But it’s essentially meaningless and I didn’t care about anything."
7531,1,"It's not subtle, but it's a lot of fun. If you enjoy the ultraviolence of a Tarantino flick, the furious action of a John Wick movie and are willing to suspend your disbelief, this is the film that will have you cackling away with giddy abandon."
7532,1,"Jalmari Helander gets satisfying contributions across the board, from the accomplished camerawork to snappy editing, an intent score, and some particularly virtuosic make-up and VFX."
7533,1,"Although the film feels a little desperate to court comparisons with the John Wick franchise and Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds, when it’s focused purely on delivering brain-off, Friday night action-movie entertainment it’s hard to resist."
7534,1,"An absurd but fun piece of pulp, Sisu plays like a mix of a spaghetti Western, a World War II thriller, and John Wick."
7535,1,"Some parts are ridiculous to the point of being implausible, but suspension of disbelief is paramount to enjoying this kind of flick."
7536,1,"As I watched the loner’s skills kick into high gear, I was thrilled by the imagination that went into the depicted mayhem. It is stylish, extremely violent and deadly and, for a fan of war movies and action thrillers, amusing as hell in its invention."
7537,1,"Serving up stone-cold multiplex mayhem, Sisu makes no bones about it — this is a film about one mad bastard killing a gazillion Nazis. It’s almost impossible not to love it."
7538,1,Imagine all the satisfyingly gory Nazi killing sequences from Inglourious Basterds neatly packed into a 91-minute grind-house-style B movie.
7539,1,"It’s super fun entertainment, which mostly disguises the fact it’s not going to stick in the mind for long."
7540,1,"'Sisu' is grisly, entertaining, and with a distinct flavour and personality in a landscape of movies that is increasingly homogenised and flatten to meet broad, accepted tastes. It's sharp, strong, and leaves you thirsty for more."
7541,1,"Prepare for minefields, Nazis, dogs, explosions, water crossing, gun toting prisoners of war and so much more in this juggernaut of violence, determination and survival."
7542,1,"Sisu knows what it is and doesn't try to pretend to be anything else: an adrenaline-packed, violent action film served up with plenty of self-aware campiness. Jorma Tommila's portrayal of Aatami Korpi, the hero who fights Nazis, is a crowd-pleasing blitz."
7543,1,Sisu's the ultimate metal movie; a Tarantino-knock-off with hyper-violent action seen through a blackly comedic lens.
7544,1,"It’s an absurd, epic action film from a country that rarely produces them. Sisu provides non-stop thrills – and who doesn’t love to see a bunch of Nazis die in the most glorious fashion?"
7545,1,"The heightened quality of everything onscreen hopes to evoke gleeful and shocked laughter over the nonstop procession of stabbings, explosions, and dismemberments. And it mostly works."
7546,1,Sisu delivers a no-nonsense bloodbath crafted with love and understanding of age-old action movie tenets.
7547,1,From the delightfully warped mind of “Rare Exports” writer/director Jalmari Helander comes a comically violent genre mashup about a legendary Finnish ex-commando known as The Immortal because of his absolute refusal to die.
7548,1,"The question is, are you in the mood to see exhilarating bursts of rough justice? Given the state of the world now, I can’t imagine why you wouldn’t be."
7549,1,"“Sisu” communicates the basics without glossing over the record, and best of all without taking up time better spent liquifying bad guys."
7550,1,If you like gritty action go check it out.
7551,1,"It doesn't have much to say, but it says it at full volume with maximum fervour and an intense disinterest in ambiguity."
7552,1,"Sisu is a 90-minute slaughter fest loaded with despicable characters that you will actually enjoy seeing being ripped to pieces. It endorses its simplicity a bit too heavily, but is an otherwise immensely entertaining piece of popcorn entertainment."
7553,1,Sisu has a pure white-knuckle ferociousness that can be felt viscerally.
7554,1,"A skillfully crafted action film with an absorbing dramatic arc that quietly builds into a deafening crescendo of bloody, gory, Nazi killing."
7555,1,"The action is absorbing and easily readable; the kills are, almost without exception, fierce and gory. The carnage isn’t unpleasant, because it’s mostly visited upon Nazis."
7556,1,"Fanciers of grindhouse cinema could do a lot worse than Jalmari Helander’s off-the-wall one-man-against-the-odds blood-fest [which] wins no points for credibility, but earns quite a few for its willingness to go completely over-the-top."
7557,1,"A riveting, violent fantasy of an action movie."
7558,1,Sisu is the thrill ride that we were all promised. It doesn’t pull any punches. It’s bloody and gory but it still manages to keep us interested and wanting to know more about the characters.
7559,1,A balls-to-the-wall Nazi-killing affair that more than lives up to the hype.
7560,0,"The film will likely make the day of those fond of violence, but should be superfluous for audiences expecting cleverer plots."
7561,1,I kept imagining it as what might have happened had Sergio Leone been alive to direct Crank: High Voltage.
7562,1,"Helander’s historical action film is full of surprises & grit. Sisu is a beautiful story about pure determination, containing epic action sequences."
7563,1,Not all viewers will want to subject themselves to Sisu's unrelenting brutality. But those who have a taste of this kind of cinema will find an intense one-hour and 31-minute plunge into a starkly diminished world.
7564,1,"Should you want to spend 90 minutes watching Nazis get shot, stabbed, gutted, blown up, run over, and beaten with a variety of inanimate objects, in the most violent and gory manner possible, this war movie is the answer to your pulp-cinema prayers."
7565,1,"A straight-as-an-arrow romp, which is really an excuse to shoot, slice, and dice Nazis in a colourfully outrageous fashion ... a bit of a simple, mostly harmless, nuke-the-fridge kind of fun. I mean, who is against killing Nazis?"
7566,1,Sisu is one of the best action movies of the year.
7567,1,"Sisu is a rhapsody of action cinema. In many ways, it feels like a predecessor to John Wick, but this dark, gloriously brutal Finnish WWII film is its own beast. A white-knuckle thrill ride with a high Nazi death count."
7568,1,"From its opening credits Sisu references '70s and '80s films, recalling them with passion and enthusiasm and focusing on the purest, unpretentious entertainment to deliver a primal and instinctual film. [Full review in Spanish]"
7569,1,"This action-packed drama outshines even the John Wick series in terms of thrilling, high-octane action."
7570,1,"A lean, mean Nazi-killing machine, Sisu is a brutal, bloody fantasy built for maximum fanboy thrills."
7571,1,"Without a doubt, an impressive experience.  [Full review in Spanish]"
7572,1,"Once the bloodletting kicks in, his pacing is relentless. It’s pretty cool from an action standpoint, but at the end of the day, action is all there really is."
7573,1,"This period neck-snapper from Finnish filmmaker Jalmari Helander... could end up taking the gore-splattered crown as the most satisfying, over-the-top violent action movie of the summer."
7574,1,"The fight sequences often feature an other-worldly quality, while the mud makes you feel firmly planted on earth. Sisu has the goods and a few of the bads."
7575,1,"In terms of story and characters Sisu offers little more than the meat-and-potatoes basics, but is energised by entertainingly gory action, a dark sense of humour, and knowing performances from its cast."
7576,1,"Let’s face it, we love to see Nazis killed and that is why Sisu is such a blast."
7577,1,"While not as impressive in scope, the fight sequences in Sisu deliver a gory delight, chock full of flying body parts and humor."
7578,1,"A simple, fast-paced thrill ride that runs with its John Wick-esque premise."
7579,1,Sisu is a blood-splattered dream action aficionados won’t want to wake from.
7580,1,"This exceedingly gory and wildly entertaining Finnish ""one man army"" movie readily recalls other, similar genre entries, but it's superbly crafted in a stripped-down, smartly paced way."
7581,1,"Herlander has made a structurally sound movie that moves at a measured rhythm, allowing for room to breathe and reset in between the setpieces."
7582,1,"Sisu features stunning action setpieces, plenty of blood, and arguably the best sound work of the year."
7583,1,"Sisu is 91 minutes of pure carnage, an exercise in annihilation entertainment."
7584,1,"Sisu is one of the goriest action movies of the last decade, delivering a 50 megaton payload of blood and guts and body parts. It's brutal, bonkers and a boat load of f*cked-up fun."
7585,1,"It’s a Nazi killing, dismembering, mutilating, head stabbing, revenge saga..."
7586,1,"Violence, entertainment, and spectacle walk hand in hand in this movie that although unrevolutionary, it's easy to enjoy... [Full review in Spanish]"
7587,1,Sisu offers up deliciously violent grindhouse fun with a grizzled and silently killer turn from Jorma Tommila
7588,1,"Sisu is all about the violence and blood, and there are buckets of both."
7589,0,"For me, it was an unsatisfying conclusion as the wear and tear had begun to be exposed, caused mostly by a scrambled storyline and wayward storytelling."
7590,1,"Now that nearly every other cinematic release reads like a holding pattern until they finally get around to mutants, Guardians Vol. 3 is the first sign in a while that Marvel might actually have some genuine enjoyment left in the tank."
7591,1,"GotG3 has no real tie-in to the larger MCU. There are a few references to Thanos, the Snap, and the Infinity Stones, but that's about it. This tracks with the trilogy as a whole, which has always stood outside the larger Marvel narratives."
7592,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a surprisingly risky blend of dark tones and sinister villainy with great visuals, tasty music, and the emotionality we expect."
7593,1,"While the fun, laughter, and quips, set to jukebox favourites that made this ragtag MCU family a joy to hang with are all present and correct, there are some problems with the Guardians’ third outing"
7594,1,"The strongest material is perhaps the most unexpected: the backstory of Rocket Raccoon, which is involving and even touching in ways that the rest of the picture is not."
7595,1,"It’s hopeful and poignant, filled with moments of empathy and integrity. Equal time is given to spectacle, with lots of stunning action sequences and psychedelic space weirdness."
7596,1,"While not as engaging or fresh as the first two films Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 still had the usual James Gunn combination of dazzling CG environments, enjoyable action and great dialogue, so it was still a fun way to spend an evening."
7597,1,A gut punch of a film that had me in tears as much as it had me smiling.
7598,1,Gunn weaves a story with Rocket that is as horrifying as it is heartwarming.
7599,0,…all just feels like indulgence of foppish creatives who don’t have much in the way of new or relatable ideas….
7600,0,Rocket's origin story is great and the only highlight of the movie. Tonally it's all over the place and the runtime is about 25 minutes too long. After the brilliance of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 we're left wondering what happened to this series.
7601,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an emotionally powerful, tear-inducing ""farewell"" to James Gunn and his Guardians. Rocket's bittersweet storyline is the soul, heart, and engine running the best MCU film since Spider-Man: No Way Home."
7602,1,"While the first two ""Guardians"" films might have been about Peter and the Guardians coming together, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is about the search for one's true identity and contribution to the greater good."
7603,1,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" shows [Marvel] still has fuel in the tank and is capable of making good movies. [The company] just needs to remember how to make character-driven stories that give its heroes something fun to accomplish."
7604,1,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is unique because Gunn not only bids farewell to our beloved rejects but helps them find self-acceptance.
7605,0,"While the script falters, the production design soars. The world of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is vivid, bold, and exciting."
7606,1,"Though Vol.3 falls prey to the formulaic trappings of the Marvel vision, it does so with Gunn’s signature personality intact."
7607,1,"The Guardians of the Galaxy are here to remind you that you’re still worthy of love, you’re not alone, and you can still be your own life’s “Kevin Bacon”."
7608,1,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3 is endearing, heartfelt, hilarious, but most of all everything you want from a finale I cried, I laughed, & I feel completely satisfied! Gunn has delivered the perfect finale & one of the best trilogies"
7609,1,"This farewell to part of the MCU always feels like a zippy, self-contained Guardians of the Galaxy movie, rather than a placeholder for more and more future franchise instalments."
7610,1,Everything comes together for this one – a brilliant screenplay from Gunn and his team of writers and a cast that seem to bring their best in what maybe some of their final times playing the characters that many cinema fans have come to know and love.
7611,0,"Emotionally manipulative, too much CGI, and not nearly as fun as the first Guardians of the Galaxy film."
7612,1,"James Gunn undeniably sticks the landing with one of the MCU’s most heartfelt and thoughtfully executed films, allowing the story to ascend to indelible heights."
7613,1,"One of the best movies in the MCU; capable of making you laugh out loud, bringing you to tears, thrilling you to the core, and proving that when Marvel Studios wants to, Marvel Studios can."
7614,1,"An entertaining sequel that once again showcases Marvel's cosmic side with a fast-paced adventure set in a space populated by action, humor, and wacky heroes listening to a greatest hits soundtrack to save the galaxy. [Full review in Spanish]"
7615,1,"It’s Gunn’s heart that shines brightest, though. His characters squabble like family but function wholly out of love for each other, which is precisely the thing that cuts through all the seemingly Marvel-mandated rigamarole."
7616,1,"Gunn refuses to give his characters the type of obvious resolutions fandom pines for. Instead, he’s crafted the bitter-sweet ending his characters deserve."
7617,0,"There's a whole bunch of nit-picky stuff that kept pulling me out of the movie, that I may well be the only one who cares about it, and the only one whose viewing experience was particularly hampered by these things."
7618,0,The lack of streamlining (ie why are there so many narrative threads?) paves the way for an uninvolving midsection...
7619,1,"It really hit all the points. The action, emotion and story were all great. The backstory of Rocket was the highlight for me."
7620,1,I liked this better than the previous entry in the series. It was a heartfelt film but didn't really wrap up storylines the way the trailers implied.
7621,0,This is filmmaking that paints by numbers and with Key Performance Indicators in mind.
7622,1,"Vol. 3 is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious MCU films, in both scope and narrative reach."
7623,1,"It’s been a while since we had something in this genre that really did this kind of narrative heavy lifting, rather than just playing in the sandbox that we know and love and are fine with just hanging out for a little while in."
7624,1,"Its wild tonal swings and penchant for undercutting dramatic beats with poorly timed levity aside, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a mostly satisfying adventure and conclusion to arguably the MCU’s most unlikely trilogy."
7625,1,"Bradley Cooper’s voice work has always been sharp, but he gets more to do here than in the first two films. There’s a whole piece of steak for his lovable space warrior to chew on here."
7626,1,Hooked on a feeling and that feeling is emotional damage.
7627,0,"Apart from everyone just yelling at one another, there is next-to-nothing to care about in the present or for the future of the characters in this thinly stretched, humor-starved attempt at closure."
7628,1,"In the heart of one of the most carefully micro-managed, corporatised franchises in contemporary media, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Gunn and company... have managed to make three consecutive films that feel earnestly personal."
7629,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is a FANTASTIC send off to one of the MCU's best trilogies! The Rocket-centric story hits every target it aims for in your heart. The themes of friendship, family and sacrifice shine brightly even amidst the stunning visuals."
7630,1,"There's a lot of tough love on display due to the fallout of everyone being a raw nerve. They won’t all remember what was spoken, but those who must remember will. That goes for us too since this trilogy capper is as much a beginning as it is an ending."
7631,0,Lacks the humor and the heart of the first two.
7632,1,"Remarkably, given the studio brand: this is absolutely Gunn's movie. It's cheerfully gross, frequently hideous to behold, nakedly emotional, indulgent to the point of bloat in its desire to tie off every narrative thread...and, happily, its own thing."
7633,1,An immensely satisfying send off to James Gunn's Guardians.
7634,0,"The animals are cute, but the action is predictable and inconsequential as the Marvel Universe struggles to find a footing into the realm originality as it enters 30+ films."
7635,1,"It’s not perfect, but for big, dumb MCU fun the Guardians still deliver."
7636,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is going to have the same effect on today’s kids that Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom had on kids in the 80s, and I mean that as the highest compliment."
7637,1,This third volume [is] a mixed bag.
7638,1,"The first strong effort from Marvel in a while, as the Rocket story drives the plot, and attaches real stakes in a way these film usually don’t."
7639,1,Why am I crying about a raccoon?
7640,1,"Boy, does Gunn come out guns blazing."
7641,1,"Gunn says goodbye to Marvel Studios in style, leaving his wake in the genre and giving us a valuable personal lesson that we must never forget: we all deserve a second chance [Full Review in Spanish]"
7642,1,"Tearfully moving with bonkers humor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 gives the world’s most bad ass trash panda from space the most meaningful film in a trilogy overrun with super heroic and perfection obsessed a-holes."
7643,1,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a tailor-fitted exit for James Gunn from Marvel’s Cinematic Universe ... the Gunniest Guardians yet in the best way.
7644,1,"This is a vibrant, high-tech film."
7645,0,"While better than most recent Marvel or DC films, it definitely lacks the fun, buddy-film aspects and sincere relationships of the original in lieu of an exhausting mission-based story."
7646,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is another stylish, laugh-out-loud, offbeat and most of all, Awesome Mix of being something beautifully human and alien at the same time."
7647,1,Completes Rocket’ transformation from a footnote to one of Marvel’ greatest characters.
7648,1,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 was surprisingly emotional and has some nice finality for James Gunn.
7649,0,Too often it feels like James Gunn made a playlist of songs he likes and then came up with scenes to go with them.
7650,1,"If this is the last episode of the series (could that really be true?), it’s done with great care and concern. Director James Gunn knows how to fire up the faithful. Now, he just needs to point out who they are."
7651,1,The heart and soul of Guardians has always been the camaraderie of the cast.
7652,1,What if the real raccoons are the friends we made along the way?
7653,1,“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” is the perfect conclusion to this group of superheroes who “take ass and kick names.” A heartfelt farewell to the most grounded and memorable family in film
7654,1,",,,having this motley crew back together one more time has deepened their ties, softened their tough exteriors, and created playful exchanges that enhance what is a dense and convoluted story."
7655,1,"A joyous sweetheart of a movie; even better is that it plays like a movie, not a Marvel product...  What’s it about? Raccoons and kindness. And gleefully bad gags. Gunn’s sheer competence soars alongside his customary monumental goofiness."
7656,1,Guardians 3 is a real warm and fuzzy movie that sometimes makes you forget that you’re a bit bored with the onslaught of superhero movies.
7657,0,A goofy and incohesive adventure tale of an intergalactic band of artificially created misfits.
7658,1,Chukwudi Iwuji as The High Evolutionary commands the screen and upstages everyone on it each and every time he appears with mad scientist vibes disguised as compassion making him more than compelling to watch. Oh yeaH!  That soundtrack is absolute fire!
7659,1,"Rocket is already my favorite Guardian, so now to see how he became who he became --  it's heartbreaking."
7660,1,"If you’re looking for a way to conclude your relationship with Marvel’s most vibrant characters, this is it. Given signs of diminishing returns here, it’s also a good example of quitting while you’re ahead."
7661,1,"There is plenty of humor, along with a bit of romance, some cliffhangers, some pathos and a lot of action in this fast-paced story. It is a good example of why Marvel movies are so popular."
7662,1,"an eclectic and affectionate mixtape that’s funny, thrilling, shattering, and bittersweet."
7663,1,"Ultimately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a thoroughly enjoyable film that, while it works best for those who have followed the franchise, it does also work as a film you can watch without context."
7664,1,"There was always something that was funny, witty, or heart wrenching that covered for any cliché that appeared."
7665,1,"I was surprised by how sad, emotional, and dark this third film was."
7666,1,"Gunn is committed to viewers understanding the horrors of being unmade and remade, inflicting a level of emotion and empathy few Marvel movies have achieved and earning every bit of crass humor as necessary moments to catch your breath."
7667,0,"Under the aegis of writer/director James Gunn, Rocket Raccoon's origin story turns out to be heavy-handed and bizarrely grotesque."
7668,1,"Be forewarned, it’s a slog for the first 90 minutes of its 2h 30m length. Then real energy kicks in."
7669,1,"Despite the film’s bloated length and tendency to embrace nostalgia without an ounce of moderation, it’s a fitting and heartfelt sendoff for the beloved crew of misfit mercenaries."
7670,0,"Garish, with an over-prolonged animal version of Sid's creepy, mutant, cobbled-together, depressing toys from ""Toy Story,"" it's got enough animal abuse for your kids to eventually need therapy sessions. Director Gunn's gone. Somebody bring back the fun."
7671,1,"It isn’t top-tier Marvel but it’s damn solid with some great gags and action throughout. Compared to recent MCU releases, however, it’s a rousing success."
7672,1,"Writer-director James Gunn knows how to make this ragtag bunch work, but there's a layer of sadness that envelops the proceedings, despite the many laugh-out-loud moments."
7673,1,"As swansongs go, Gunn’s farewell to the MCU is finely tuned."
7674,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is by far one the strongest entries in the post-Endgame era. A classic adventure with a lot of heart that makes the most out of its core characters, consequentially bringing the saga to a well deserved solid closure."
7675,0,"Gunn falls prey to franchise imperatives and Marvel cultural mores. More is more, leaving less and less screen time for the human story."
7676,1,James Gunn has an incredible way of balancing the mix of humor and heart... and has gotten bigger and better with that.
7677,1,"Flashy, fun and funny, it honours its main characters..."
7678,1,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 makes use of what comes before without being totally bogged down. It’s a working film product, if not a superlatively meaningful work of art."
7679,1,"There's a strong central plot running through this epic, but it's so cluttered that it can be tricky to keep track of it."
7680,1,"The funny – and occasionally challenging – film eschews universal stakes for emotional ones, giving us a bittersweet send-off for the ragtag heroes."
7681,0,"The fact that Gunn himself, as writer and director, has an unusual degree of authority, and thereby seems to be largely constraining himself, renders the narrow results all the more oppressive."
7682,1,"Vol. 3 scales up with an excessive 150-minute runtime but commits that length to splashing Gunn’s signature brand of gooey sentimentality across the biggest, loudest, most color-mad canvas that a Disney budget can afford."
7683,1,I cried twice.
7684,1,"This is a fitting conclusion to Gunn's iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, full of heart and comedy, cementing an unknown B-team into a memorable A-team of A-holes."
7685,1,"From visually stunning images to the biggest action scenes to the comedy and the heart, the family, and the journey, Guardians of The Galaxy Vol 3 had a lot to live up to, and it's easily the best Marvel movie since End Game."
7686,0,"With two villains instead of one, an endless succession of rescues and more endings than The Lord of the Rings, volume three is the same bloated two-and-a-half-hour leviathan as every other Marvel movie these days."
7687,1,"Gunn goes the whole hog with the animals in this film, from cute talking dogs to mutant pigs and even heart-rending scenes in a jail cell featuring a raccoon, a walrus and an otter."
7688,1,"Not as good as the Christmas special, but still pretty good."
7689,1,"While the sheer force of Holmes’ personality would make for a compelling documentary on its own, it’s the tenderness and honesty that all of these participants show that makes this so poignant."
7690,1,"As tragic as the accident was, it's impossible to walk away from David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived without feeling inspired and with a new appreciation for life."
7691,1,"The Boy Who Lived finds comfort in how friends cope when one of the team falls down, and it has the wisdom to recognise that the person who is supposed to need looking after often ends up caring for everyone else."
7692,1,"The Boy Who Lived moves effortlessly from heartbreaking to hilarious, often in the same scene, providing a complete emotional journey the likes of which are rarely seen in films about tough guys doing tough-guy things like dangerous stunts."
7693,1,"Through [Holmes'] untainted pride for his work, the film becomes not just a tribute to one individual, but to all those behind the scenes who bring magic to the movies."
7694,1,"The documentary works to introduce its audience to Holmes, who proves deserving of the spotlight. But they’ll go in knowing Radcliffe already, and as a result, it’s the star who feels most illuminated by The Boy Who Lived."
7695,1,"Much of what makes The Boy Who Lived special are the inexplicable ways people respond to the unexpected, and the randomly tragic, and whether they stick around when it would be much easier to vanish, as if by wizardry."
7696,1,"This quietly inspiring portrait of stoicism ends, beautifully... [Full review in Spanish]"
7697,1,"The Boy Who Lived lacks the complexity and frisson that might have set it apart... It is content to be a solid tale of perseverance and friendship, a story about, as Holmes himself puts it, “overcoming adversity.” Look for nothing more, or less."
7698,1,"Alternately uplifting and devastating, a warm reminiscence about the Harry Potter franchise and a glimpse into child stardom, it’s finally a tribute to its namesake, who concludes that he’d “better tell my story, or it won’t be told.”"
7699,1,"This uplifting story of triumph over adversity puts friendships front and centre, as David Holmes recounts his struggles since his life changing accident on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2."
7700,1,“The Boy Who Lived” provides an unusual behind-the-scenes portrait of how life goes on after movies are made.
7701,1,"Not a deeply probing Hollywood documentary but filled to the brim with fun behind-the-scenes footage. The Boy Who Lived is a likable, grounded, and heartfelt portrait of a Harry Potter stuntman whose career was cut far too short."
7702,1,"In this tragic story, Holmes is unbowed -- and to see him and Radcliffe ambling through the Potter archives together, reminiscing about the good times, is both triumphant and heartbreaking."
7703,1,"David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived is a remarkable story of resilience and love, told through the optimistic eyes of Holmes and his tremendous support system."

7766,1,"While it covers a lot of ground, it rarely digs deep."
7767,1,"Captures the contrast between his electrifying charm on stage and the challenging personal matters he faces offstage. An incredibly inspirational and illuminating tale, showcasing Batiste’s optimism and perseverance in the face of life’s challenges."
7768,1,"Jaouad's courage is humbling, and Batiste's ability to create and perform at a consistently high level during such a difficult time is nothing short of inspirational."
7769,1,"It's a documentary about love on many different levels in telling the story of musician Jon Batiste and his writer wife Suleika Jaouad during her cancer journey. There are no real surprises, but the movie is a bittersweet celebration of life."
7770,1,"[T]he film is plainly stated in its themes and styles and, as a result, suffers from a monotony that, while reflective of the film’s sobering perspective on life’s highs and lows, translates to an imperfect, if moving, final product."
7771,1,"It can be hard to keep the balance in covering all of these things, but Heineman manages it. And it helps that he has chosen such a compelling subject."
7772,1,"“American Symphony” is a study in contrasts, much like Heineman taking on a story so vastly different from the rest of his milieu."
7773,0,The latter sections of “American Symphony” feel like a film checking off boxes from Batiste’s year in 2022.

7830,1,"The Batman is an ALL TIME BEST FILM. Matt Reeves has crafted the DEFINITIVE take on The Caped Crusader that Pattinson will define for generations to come. Brooding and brutal, I didn’t want it to end."
7831,1,The Batman isn’t just another entry in a trilogy or a multi-directed Batman starring three Bruce Wayne’s. It’s a love letter to fans who have waited decades for a faithful adaptation of Batman.
7832,1,"This latest Batman tale is grounded, noir and detective based, and a highly realistic entry into the movie mythos of the caped crusader."
7833,1,"It’s a part-serial killer mystery, part-superhero adventure, and part-crime drama stuffed in a 3-hour runtime that can feel loaded but never dull."
7834,0,"Not only does the central plot feel like a rehashing of other films and comic books, the entire movie plays like a patchwork quilt of past works."
7835,1,A phenomenal take on the caped crusader that will leave you wanting more from this Batman world.
7836,1,"The Batman becomes less of a full-throttle action romp and more of a detective tale, an arc that hasn’t been filmed before."
7837,1,"BEST Batman Film yet…. Beautifully made with incredible action sequences, a thrilling mystery, & amazing characters. You can’t get any better than this & wherever smart Reeves goes next door will I."
7838,1,"With an incredible score by Michael Giacchino, and a backdrop of Nirvana songs to elevate the mood, The Batman is a fantastic film. The acting and fighting sequences will keep audiences on the edge of their seats."
7839,1,"Matt Reeves delivers a distinctly darker, more intense, frighteningly realistic noir thriller than past adaptations, with an aggressively vengeful Bruce Wayne / Batman and a fear-inducing, mysterious, lunatic Riddler."
7840,1,"Even with a runtime of nearly three hours, The Batman leaves the audience wanting more. While ultimately fumbling the ending, the characters, performances, plot, and visual appearance leave enough behind to warrant a return to this version of Gotham."
7841,1,"The Batman is everything a superhero film should be. It’s gritty, stylistic, and most importantly, there’s an intrinsic balance between the action and quiet moments, which Matt Reeves masters superbly through this adaptation."
7842,0,"In a lot of ways, the disjointed editing in The Batman leaves much for the viewer to process; not enough time exists for key character moments."
7843,1,"... In this Batman -- very different from Nolan's, Burton's or Schumacher's -- everything seems more appeased, more contained, more... human. [Full review in Spanish]"
7844,1,"They turned revealing an antagonist's presence to the audience without the victim's knowledge into a suspense-driven art. Here, Reeves taps directly into these tactics to phenomenal effect..."
7845,1,This is the ultimate Batman movie.
7846,1,Batman's superpower has always been that he's the smartest guy in the room. ... His title as the Dark Knight Detective has never been showcased on film as well as it was in The Batman.
7847,1,"It may take three hours for Bruce to learn this lesson, but it's an incredible three hours. It may be fun to watch Pattinson put on black make-up and strap into the Batsuit to fight some bad guys, but there's much more to this story than just that."
7848,1,"THE BATMAN exceeds my expectations and passes the bar of a reboot. It justifies its own existence with great storytelling, insights into humanity and human society, and powerful performances."
7849,0,"“The Batman” reaches for an ingenious and compelling new way to tell a story about the thin lines between corruption, greed and nobility — but ever so limply and always just out of its grasp."
7850,1,Good. Dark Moody. He is Batman.
7851,1,Matt Reeves’ The Batman brings us closest to the essence of the Batman character than any film adapted from the DC comics have since Tim Burton’s inaugural Batman in 1989.
7852,1,"The Batman is a brave, bold and brilliant new take on a familiar character and Reeves and Pattinson have done him proud."
7853,1,"Matt Reeves’ The Batman is a brutal, uncompromising vision that leaves its indelible mark in comic book film history."
7854,1,"The film casts long shadows with blacks and grays, but the consistent, bleeding flashes of red paint the most intense moments with jarring contrast."
7855,1,"The Batman is the only comic book adaptation since The Dark Knight to come close to recreating that cinematic achievement, brilliantly blending entertainment with artistry."
7856,1,"Reeves, it should be noted, assembles a lot of other people’s ideas and themes into this mammoth package. The movie is a triumph of craft and design, but original it ain’t."
7857,1,"Reeves’ vision is fresh and innovative, building a young (but not brand new) version of the Bat world that is satisfying as a single film, while planting the seeds for a juggernaut franchise."
7858,1,The Batman transcends an oversaturated genre and gives arguably the best portrayal of the caped crusader yet. Matt Reeves delivers a slow-burn detective noir with a terrifying villain and ever-rising tension. A rare film that I would call a masterpiece!
7859,1,"Writer-director Matt Reeves knows how to write a blockbuster with brains, and he knows how to film one with visual flare."
7860,1,"The way that everything is spliced and shaken together, and the mood — and it's definitely a mood — makes this weighty, heavy, sublimely shot, excellently cast, always-engaging blockbuster feel new, and all things Batman with it."
7861,1,"THE BATMAN shows that even the best intentions may inspire mayhem, cause heck this is Gotham."
7862,1,"And even though at times the movie seems a little too male-centric, in times when this is almost prohibited, it felt good to feel those testosterone punches in such a quality, entertaining film. [Full review in Spanish]"
7863,0,How many times can this story be told? Next time pray that the filmmakers aren’t this self-serious about their own vision and that the running time values your time outside of Gotham.
7864,1,"Lovers of action, fight sequences, digital effects, and mainstream fare may be driven to mental torture. [Full review in Spanish]"
7865,1,"Matt Reeves is a director with a vision. I'm glad I enjoy that vision, because Batman needs to have good movies."
7866,1,It is a victory of story and a failure of plot.
7867,1,"If they had to do one more go on dark, broody, loner, brutal Batman and they decided the selling point was going to be a push into noir... if it had to happen, this is not a bad result. Actually it's pretty good."
7868,1,"Do we actually need another brooding Bat-flick of this type? Not really -- a little of Vincent Price prancing around as Egghead would be a welcome sight right about now -- but given its assignment, it mostly gets the job done."
7869,1,"Operatic, simmering, and replete with a smoky noir atmosphere, The Batman is an enthralling package of contradictions."
7870,1,"more procedural than action movie, a kind of DC Universe version of Seven (1995)"
7871,0,"Matt Reeves' The Batman features skillful cinematography, an epic score, and a memorable turn or two from the cast, but it's all undone by a remarkably weak screenplay that ultimately turns the film into a repetitive, unengaging, and over-long slog."
7872,1,"More than a superhero film –there is little ""super"" about the masked hero– it is a contemporary film noir with touches of absolute terror. [Full review in Spanish]"
7873,1,Reeves succeeds much more in the exposition of situations than in the way in which he manages to solve them. [Full review in Spanish]
7874,1,Solid and fleshed out. [Full review in Spanish]
7875,1,"‘The Batman’ is a little long, but it’s an overall surprisingly fun and creepy comic book film that never takes itself too seriously. And Robert Pattinson makes one good emo Batman."
7876,1,A solid and adult thriller…with constant rhythm that draws away from the traditional blockbuster. [Full review in Spanish]
7877,0,"Certainly stylish and intense, but ultimately in service of a simplistic story."
7878,1,"A dazzling, enveloped, night-time spectacle. [Full review in Spanish]"
7879,0,A no man's land that will not comfort the multiplex spectators in search of adrenaline... [Full Review in Spanish]
7880,1,"If any character leaves you wanting more in a good way, it's Farrell. He's very entertaining, something the film strives very hard to be in all its gothic rage. It's his young Penguin who nearly steals Matt Reeves's film."
7881,1,A Batman that has never been seen in cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
7882,1,"The action scenes and special effects in The Batman are top-notch, but what makes it all worth watching (on top of your device's Pause button for bathroom breaks) is the strong supporting cast..."
7883,0,"While the film has been mostly applauded, that for me was where the good stuff ended. First of all, it is interminable. 2 hours and 56 minutes!!!! I mean.that is not necessary."
7884,1,"""The Batman"" is an installment of an often-depicted superhero that manages to give a fresh take. Both atmosphere and plot are dark and heavy. This may not be the kind of movie for those who lean more towards the MarvelDisney fanfare."
7885,1,"Overlong but quite strong as an origin story that works on an emotional level by the end. The cast handles this material well, making it more of a detective yarn with hints of commentary about privilege by the end that could've been fleshed out more."
7886,1,"A fairly good mock up for a Batman film templated as a graphic novel. Its dark and seedy mood is new backdrop for the Batman films but in terms of showcasing what this cape crusader has to offer in story telling, there is nothing new here."
7887,1,Ugly beauty is the nature of The Batman.
7888,0,"If it's neither fun nor searing, even those iconic pointy ears might struggle to hear the point."
7889,1,The Batman shows that Reeves interpretation is one that knows that Caped Crusader was always as famous for his brains as his brawn
7890,1,It appears that Warner Brothers holy union with HBO MAX has rubbed off on them. diandrareviews
7891,1,"It remains an action thriller that, with detective intrigue and atmospheric styling, shows an unexplored side of the dark knight in a Gotham City that is always drenched in rain and corruption at night. Full review in Spanish"
7892,1,"The bigger problem is: the Riddler's menace mostly comes from the Army surplus togs and voice modulation. Otherwise, his demeanor is more like the creepy guy in your sophomore CompLit class who always volunteered to read the Henry Miller excerpts."
7893,1,"Thanks to Pattinson and Danos compelling performances, as well as Reevess ambitious direction, The Batman is an enthralling thriller and a welcome return for the Caped Crusader."
7894,1,Matt Reeves The Batman is a riveting and passionately crafted film noir that wears its inspiration on its sleeve while bringing Detective Batman to the big screen.
7895,1,"hose seeking a grim reflection of our times, will find it; those seeking an escape likely will not. And yet, depressive as it is, the film is electrifying, potent, fun."
7896,1,Pattinson successfully goes back in time with this character...
7897,1,"I didn’t think I wanted another Batman movie. But it turns out that Matt Reeves’s The Batman -- starring Robert Pattinson, who played Edward Cullen in the Twilight films -- has the Batman we need."
7898,1,"Matt Reeves and Robert Pattinson made it look easy to make a new great Batman movie. Greig Fraser, Colin Pharrell and Paul Dano steal the show. The best Gotham out there in a universe full of potential. Full review in Spanish"
7899,1,"Reeves takes inspiration from numerous comic storylines, mixing and matching to concoct an elaborate tapestry that overflows with iconic characters in differing stages of repute. While not as emotive as his Apes films, the blockbuster spectacle remain."
7900,1,Always great to see a director with a distinct vision amidst a pool of adaptations. Matt Reeves commits to it and offers a rumination closer to Munich than whacks and pows.
7901,1,"It doesnt execute every second of its runtime perfectly, but its sense of ambition and drive buoy its entire epic narrative, giving us a reason to get excited about Batman at the movies once again."
7902,1,"Strange, squalid and sinister, Matt Reeves' version is dark and deadly."
7903,1,"""The Batman"" offers several great action pieces, but the movie does begin to crumble under its own weight, both in terms of the near-three-hour runtime and its own self-importance."
7904,1,"Perhaps the biggest indictment of Gotham City is that even the villains feel a burning need to fight crime and corruption. Sex and sleaze are everywhere, apart from the Batcave, which may as well be a monks cell."
7905,1,
7906,0,"Although Matt Reeves does make attempts to inflect the tired subject matter with some virtuosity, the universe's over-familiarity and essential stodginess overrides any novelty, to my mind, at least."
7907,1,"Star Pattinson is electric in the role of Batman, expressing so much with his intense silence and reactions to the chaos."
7908,1,There's a tactile stickiness to the world that clings to you and immerses you.
7909,1,"It's quite possible ""The Batman"" might be too dark and disturbing for some viewers, but I thought it was pretty terrific."
7910,1,"This new The Batman is a seductive, and gripping detective tale by way of super-heroism. If this is what blockbuster filmmaking in 2022 looks like, then were off to a great start."
7911,0,The film I imagine Ricky Fitts would grow up to make after the events of 'American Beauty.'
7912,0,Matt Reeves’ meandering faux-profound take on Batman spends its over-long runtime telling women to shut up and do as they’re told or face the consequences.
7913,1,"175 minutes, dark in form and brilliant in execution, that break any labels a preconceived ideas, making the concepto of ""superhero movies"" lose all its meaning despite the masks and capes showing on screen."
7914,1,"Thrilling from beginning to end, The Batman offers a bleaker spin on Gotham City's beloved hero as he discovers his role in a city just as wounded as him. Full Review in Spanish"
7915,1,...an above-average comic-book adaptation...
7916,0,"It verges on camp without committing to it, and it essays the operatic without being able to provide the emotional impetus required."
7917,1,"Stylish and stark, packed with well-executed action and high-quality performances, The Batman is a welcome addition to the canon of the Caped Crusader. Heres hoping we get to see more of what Reeves, Pattinson and the rest have in mind."
7918,1,"What this film does achieve, however, is telling a solid new Batman story, one with some pretty compelling twists and a strong point-of-view on who, exactly, the Caped Crusader is. By default, that makes it one of the better Batman movies ever made."
7919,1,"As for special effects, they are very good, and Greig Fraser’s cinematography is epic."
7920,1,How you like this iteration of Batman may depend upon how you like your serial murderers served and if you like your casting on a binary of Black and White.
7921,1,"The cast is fine, with Pattinson adding his own touch to a role now undertaken by six different actors in the past 30 years, seven if you go back to Adam West and the original television show of the 1960s."
7922,1,"A beefy, stylised approach and committed performances make this take on the Dark Knight worth a look, even if the film fails to break out of the usual cliched lack of light and colour."
7923,1,"This is everything I could have asked for in a Batman film. I loved the tone, easter eggs, and so much research that went into this. Bobby Patts brought something different to this character that really stood out. I really loved this film."
7924,1,This is at least in the top three Batman films of all time for me. It was a combination of all of the best elements of the Batman character and Gotham as a city. It blew me away. This was fantastic.
7925,1,The Dark Knight returns with a more hopeful take on vengeance
7926,1,"This Batman is as dark, depressed and angry as many of those living in these dark, stressful times. Batman wants revenge, while the villain wants to expose government corruption. Thus, the normal superhero story formula is upended."
7927,1,"The good guy/bad guy duality — opposite sides of the same coin — has been done to death in past Batman movies. In this one, suffice it to say, it’s taken to startling heights."
7928,1,"""... a veritable breath of fresh air in an industry glutted with visually banal superhero films with plots that feel written by committee."""
7929,1,"As premature as it might be to say in a review for an initial theatrical run, Carol more than earns the right of comparison to Brief Encounter in terms of quality. Frankly, it’s one of the new great romantic films."
7930,1,Todd Haynes delves into the noir-kissed world of Patricia Highsmith...
7931,1,"These are fractions of instances that straight people can’t see, but inside, we feel our hearts pounding and our minds racing with possibility. That’s what Carol—and the holiday season for that matter—are all about."
7932,1,... An extraordinary film in every sense. [Full review in Spanish]
7933,1,Carol is one of the better film adaptions in recent memory and has truly withstood the test of time.
7934,1,A masterpiece of melancholy longing that manages to miraculously avoid being devastatingly tragic or dramatic.
7935,1,"Haynes, an experimental filmmaker whose dramatic work may seem straightforward yet is anything but, knows just how to fold his audience into a moment."
7936,1,"Todd Haynes and Phyllis Nagy created a compelling, extraordinary tale about love and its meanders in life. The time passes, but Carol remains the most critical romantic story with a happy ending. For me, it will always mean a lot."
7937,1,"Poised, elegant and desperately moving, it's yet another tour de force turn from an actress who has clearly defined herself as the best of her generation."
7938,1,"Veering toward moments of heightened drama, Haynes shows measured restraint in maintaining the focus that essentially this is a story about love, rather than heading into cheaper plot devices."
7939,1,"A gorgeous, complicated and absolutely captivating film."
7940,1,"The second time I watched Carol all I did was cry. I cried over the scarves and the love-seats, the brooches and Rooney's pinned-up bob, the way Cate Blanchett unfolds her body like angel's wings"
7941,0,"In the end, the décor, costumes and settings are little more than a backdrop for an affair that does not follow ""a prescribed path."""
7942,1,A wonderful and all-too-rare film.
7943,1,An entertaining endeavor and a poignant message about love's ability to overcome adversity.
7944,1,"Unreasonably chilly and isolating, the central romance never feels believable, but Blanchett's titular performance is a wonderful portrait of manipulation."
7945,1,"The fragility of the characters and their courtship makes for a compelling tale. There are several layers to the film, and it softly transfixes you, making it a must-watch."
7946,0,"There comes a point where the melodramatic idyll wears me out, despite the excellent performances from Blanchett and Mara. [Full review in Spanish]"
7947,1,A good film will tell you everything you need to know. A great film will show you.
7948,1,"Carol is a timeless love story between two women in 1950s New York with absolutely stellar performances from its cast, beautiful writing from Phyllis Nagy and exquisite craftsmanship from Todd Haynes."
7949,1,"Haynes' vision of love is not the conquers-all variety, but rather ""we'll muddle through, no matter the cost."" It's a beautiful sentiment, befitting a beautifully constructed film from one of our era's greatest filmmakers."
7950,1,"[Carol] gets a suitably lush treatment by Todd Haynes, who created a film recalling the best work of that noted 1950's auteur Douglas Sirk."
7951,1,"Overall, Carol is stunning, compelling and unmissable."
7952,1,A perfect film. [Full Review in Spanish]
7953,1,The chemistry amongst the leads is forged into an excellent story by Todd Haynes. [Full Review in Spanish]
7954,1,"With her striking beauty, sophisticated demeanor, [Cate] Blanchett's amazing characterization lights up the screen."
7955,1,Achingly precise (and unexpectedly poignant) performances from Blanchett and Mara keeps the whole thing well away from soap-opera territory.
7956,1,"A major work by a major filmmaker, working at a level of narrative grace and elegance that is almost unmatched in contemporary cinema."
7957,1,"Every element of Carol serves to complicate, beatify, or forbid the ferocious looks of longing that pass between Blanchett and Mara. The film lives for these moments."
7958,1,The understanding reached thanks to Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy is of the exquisite and emotionally devastating variety.
7959,1,"Carol is a brazen love story that is brave enough to be set in another time and place and is passionate as hell. A superbly executed film, most especially in terms of writing and characters."
7960,1,"Christmas movie: the melancholy, the longing, the flashes of joy and anticipation, the rushes of despair. And, finally, hope - as a new year unfolds and love steps out of the shadows."
7961,1,"... caressed in soft-focus pastels, the beautiful strangeness of Carol is very much of-a-piece with Haynes's world, even as it expands it."
7962,0,"If only Carol, the much lauded movie from director Todd Haynes were as good as its trailer, a one minute ten second masterpiece of close-ups, pitch-perfect period detail and barely contained emotion."
7963,1,"Carol simply oozes class - the look, the narrative, the direction and its performances...making it a most beautiful film not just to behold, but to experience emotionally."
7964,1,It's Blanchett and Mara who really shine... There is so much beauty in their work. No film has touched me more in 2015 than Carol.
7965,1,CAROL is an incredibly articulate film in terms of the character moments that are subtle with their execution yet boisterous in their meaning.
7966,1,It's a joy to see female characters written with such depth and played so achingly well by actors at the top of their game.
7967,0,"The main problem is that the social tapestry is far, far less interesting than in Far from Heaven."
7968,1,"Carol filled me with hope and promise, which felt completely unexpected coming from Todd Haynes. Yet there's still a lingering fear in every frame, the presence of facades, gesture and shadow, the feeling of a set of eyes upon you. It's a masterpiece."
7969,1,"A slow, intellectual, coming-of-age romance, Carol is a stunningly filmed piece of emotionally distant art."
7970,1,"A luscious and profound piece on relationships, sexuality and repression."
7971,1,"There are so few movies that dare to build themselves around female leads that Carol comes across as outrageously daring. It should not be, but there we are."
7972,1,"With a minimum number of words and gestures, Mara conveys the complex inner life of Therese, a young woman in 1950s New York who's trying to understand what it means to fall in love."
7973,1,"It makes me wish the word ""epic"" hadn't been completely diluted so I could bring the full weight of its meaning to bear on this love story. Extraordinary? Singular? Remarkable? Yes, all of those things too."
7974,1,"How gorgeous and complex and unforgettable is the world Haynes has created in Carol, and how lovely it is to realize that it might just be our own."
7975,1,"Carol is a voluptuous, simmering, shimmering, careless whisper of a film that could easily have been written entirely for Cate Blanchett."
7976,1,"The film is a triumph of art direction and wardrobe, a seductive art object. When Carol tells her husband ""we're not ugly people, Harge,"" she is telling the truth about a film that finds beauty in bad situations."
7977,1,"Stunningly atmospheric and featuring eye-catching production and costume design, the romance can be stilted at times, but it's hard not to appreciate the cinematic composition in its entirety."
7978,1,"... the ending, although extensive, moves... [Full review in Spanish]"
7979,1,The story can be a little over-leisurely in its unfolding but it builds to a powerful finale.
7980,1,There isn't a single scene that is anything less than stunning to look at
7981,1,This is a society you will recognise - for Carol goes well beyond Carol.
7982,1,Underplay and restraint are the strengths of Carol. This is a film that stays clear of dramatisation. It kills you softly.
7983,1,Not perfect but a must-see for those who like to keep an eye on the serious award contenders.
7984,1,"Carol is a strange film to parse. It's certainly one of the very best made and well-acted films of the year, but its sum total is cold and reserved."
7985,1,"Languid and seductive, it's a slow burner with Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett as an exquisitely matched pair."
7986,1,Carol is a perfect film that will restore your faith in cinema.
7987,1,"What results is equally tragic and beautiful, highlighting the terrible consequences of societal rejection and stigma."
7988,1,In the Golden Age of Hollywood-the 1940s and '50s-there was a genre called the 'woman's picture.' Contemporary filmmaker Todd Haynes has become the modern master of the form.
7989,1,"Cate Blanchett may well be on her way to a third Oscar, and it would not be undeserved. Her Carol is assured, but her consequences are greater, as is the range of emotion Blanchett displays."
7990,1,[Todd] Haynes remains the consummate filmmaking artist.
7991,1,Add Todd Haynes' midcentury love story Carol to your list of favorite Christmas-themed films.
7992,1,I relish this stunningly framed paean to female love but fear something priggish is buried within it.
7993,1,"Though much of Carol highlights the sexism and rigid social expectations of the time, it's not a preachy film. It's dramatic, certainly, but on a small scale, not a large scale."
7994,1,"Among the virtues of Todd Haynes's new film, Carol, is the delicacy, the patience, and the sheer amount of screen time that it lavishes on the experience of falling in love."
7995,1,"I can think of no better way to describe Carol to others - it is so powerful, so important, so real and alive that it makes you forget it's not happening to you."
7996,1,"So enraptured was I by the look of the movie, I was almost able to overlook the fact that we don't actually get a lot of dialogue between the two women."
7997,1,"To call Carol a Christmas miracle feels like a gaudy understatement, but that's sort of exactly what it is."
7998,1,"A film for anybody who has ever fallen in and out of love, dealing with hopeless infatuation and the slow transition to the messy reality that all but threatens to burn out the initial spark, Carol is more than just a gorgeously crafted period piece."
7999,1,What Haynes gets so perfectly right with this film really is the very specific sense of time and place.
8000,1,"Everything is so perfectly beautiful in Carol, director Todd Haynes' '50s melodrama, that it more closely resembles a museum diorama than a movie -- until its luminous stars, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, breathe life and passion into it."
8001,1,The smile of recognition and understanding that closes things out is an unforgettable celebratory stunner that shook me right to my very core.
8002,1,This is a slender movie that Haynes gives plenty of antique atmosphere.
8003,1,A love story of sublime subtlety where the smallest encounters have the most consuming impact.
8004,1,"Carol is a sensuous, enchanting piece of work which vividly and realistically recreates the 1950s in American in a new way -- never seeming twee or idealised."
8005,1,"Carol tracks the slow-burn of romantic agony, with the added weight of a closet the size of the world."
8006,1,"A showcase for the towering talents of Blanchett and Mara, Carol is a sumptuous watch."
8007,1,Never has the impossible glamour of Cate Blanchett been used to better effect than in Todd Hayne's ravishing and romantic Carol.
8008,1,A wondrously beautiful piece of filmmaking by American director Todd Haynes.
8009,1,"Though it's certainly a two-woman show, Carol finds room to be impossibly generous to very nearly every human being who appears onscreen."
8010,1,One of this year's best films.
8011,1,"A movie that adheres to the Hollywood canons, impeccably shot and crafted and a strong presence by Blanchet and Mara. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8012,1,"'Carol' feels like the third part of a loose trilogy of films set in the past, about women who are trapped by the confines of their time."
8013,1,Carol is a dizzyingly romantic love story that will appeal to any filmgoer.
8014,1,"In their story set in the past, there lies possibility, which is what infuses Carol and Haynes's best work generally, the transcendence of being and becoming yourself."
8015,1,"I value Haynes as an artist, but his art isn't revelatory or emotional; it signifies feelings rather than sharing them."
8016,1,"The period trappings remain impeccable throughout, crackling even when the script doesn't."
8017,1,"The torment is captured well enough in the faces of the actors, their characters locked inside an indifferent, inhospitable world."
8018,1,"A perfectly acted, perfectly sculpted, perfectly rounded exploration of love and strife in the not-so-perfect '50s."
8019,1,"The film still makes the viewer swoon, its heady mood of love and longing generated by the briefest of glances and gestures."
8020,1,"As he did with his gloriously realized 2002 domestic drama Far From Heaven, director Todd Haynes once more brings a story of how, in the pursuit of dreams, even happy endings can come with collateral damage."
8021,1,"The rhythm is slow but the film is never boring, this is a story worthy of seeing in the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
8022,1,"Carol is a truly striking cinematic achievement, artfully exploring themes that resonate still with powerful force today."
8023,1,"Carol is a movie worth watching to understand its main theme without fear of censorship, and most of all, to realize and understand that love is love regardless of genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8024,1,What Carol captures more specifically than the thrill of a romantic encounter is the act of remembering only to forget.
8025,1,"This is pure cinema, which through its artistry opens a window into the souls of its characters and admittedly opens the closed windows of its viewers as well."
8026,1,"Carol is a n excellent film, full of warmth and romance."
8027,1,"In spite of being Hannes' less ambitious cinematic film, Carol offers the experience of putting you in the shoes of it's characters and feel what they feel. [Full review in Spanish]"
8028,1,"An elegant, profound, meassured and extraordinary crafted film. Blanchett and Mara are hypnotic. [Full review in Spanish]"
8029,1,"A compelling terror tale that retains the flavor of Bram Stoker but adopts the pattern of Alien (the tagline might as well have been “At sea, no one can hear you scream”)."
8030,0,"Despite the nature of its monster, the film lacks any real bite and feels very predictable and lacking in atmosphere or movement."
8031,0,The concessive events that are narrated... do not successfully spark interest sufficient to maintain afloat this two-hour film that is also not very entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
8032,1,"A gothic claustrophobic horror tale that presents us with an animalistic and genuinely scary Dracula, who is brought to aggressive life by Javier Botet."
8033,1,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is pretty in that gritty style that says everyone needs a bath and no one should share a comb. With 95% of the film taking place on the Demeter, the ship feels both vast and claustrophobic."
8034,0,"You have a pretty good sense of what’s going to happen. ... If you have a boat with a “Vampire on Board” bumper sticker, there’s a good chance that one crew member after another is getting slaughtered, and it’s just a matter of watching it happen."
8035,1,"The movie knows exactly what it is ... It doesn’t take itself seriously, but it’s also never winking at us, which is a fine line to walk."
8036,1,"Director André Øvredal knows how to deliver jump-scare horror. … Here, though, he throttles back on the in-your-face horror, opting instead to build up tension and let it snap in measured doses."
8037,1,"Did we really need this Dracula footnote to set sail at all? Perhaps not, but while Øvredal’s expansion on the world isn’t as fun as the grim fables from which it draws blood, it still has some bite."
8038,1,"It’s just such a well executed, relentlessly grim, and creepy horror entry with a Dracula we’ve never actually seen before."
8039,0,Nosfera-too bad this movie is boring and terrible!
8040,0,"There is a lack of ideas, both in terms of staging and content, in order to keep the audience happy.  [Full review in Spanish]"
8041,0,"Either the undercooked screenplay needed to marinate for another decade or two or, more likely than not, the promise inherent in the premise was never meant for anything more than what it always was, a chapter in Stoker’s novel."
8042,0,"Consistently creepy yet rarely terrifying, this flat spinoff doesn’t make any meaningful additions to the mythology of the source material."
8043,0,There’s a brief novelty to the bloody spectacle that Øvredal’s latest provides but this supposed final voyage feels considerably thin by its end
8044,0,I'm not quite sure how you make a vampire slasher on a boat boring and yet here we are.
8045,1,"It manages to develop a tense and slightly bloody story, where all sexuality has been removed from Dracula in order to portray him as a true monster. It could have been better, but it's not like I regret seeing it at the cinema. Full review in Spanish."
8046,1,"While not the best vampire film, its phenomenal visuals, cast, and tense moments make The Last Voyage of the Demeter worth watching."
8047,1,"Though there is much to decry about the film, there’s enough present here to make the price of a ticket worth your while. Just get ready to queue up some quiet music when you leave the theater."
8048,0,"Dracula may fare well at sea, but his film mostly sinks under its weight of cliche-strewn course."
8049,1,"After many, many Dracula/vampire movies, a good, simple idea like this one works surprisingly well, thanks to the fixed, moody setting, intricate sound design, and an eerie, malevolent monster."
8050,1,"I do wonder what Øvredal would have made of a Norse monster rather than one born of a British imagination. For what it is, it's good enough."
8051,0,"Directed by such an expert in the genre like André Øvredal and gifted with a score composed by Thomas Newman, The Last Voyage of the Demeter sets up the fantasy but fails to bring the terror. [Full review in Spanish]"
8052,0,"After reading the brief plot description, you’ve practically seen the movie."
8053,0,The enactment of life aboard a merchant ship and the disturbing atmosphere of this journey at the turn of the XIX century are amongst the best elements of this uneven adaptation. [Full review in Spanish]
8054,0,"And as soon as the Demeter sets sail, it begins to submerge. [Full review in Spanish]"
8055,0,"In the end The Last Voyage of the Demeter doesn’t totally suck, but it lacks the bite it needs to separate it from the multitude of Dracula cinematic entries."
8056,1,"The story is tragic, the vibes are excellent, and the ensemble sells every minute. It may feel subdued, but you’ll probably still leave with a satisfying chill."
8057,0,Commendable atmosphere and creature design can’t save a horrendous screenplay.
8058,0,"It’s a long wait between killings, and the killings are never very impressive or even distinct from each other."
8059,0,"André Øvredal should be a great choice to bring tension and scares, but he's on autopilot and his great cast has nothing to do. Cobweb's Woody Norman fares best, in part because his character has the best sequence."
8060,1,"It's old-school story telling - as it should be, considering its origin - that never pulls back from the gore."
8061,0,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter will certainly not be the last time Dracula is resurrected for a movie, but this take on the old monster has all the lifeblood sucked out of it."
8062,1,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a relentless, heartless film. This type of bleak movie won't resonate with most audiences. Corey Hawkins really get to show his range."
8063,1,"Dark, ominous, chilling equals fun in viewing an above average vampire movie."
8064,0,"This loose, bloated adaptation of “Log of the Demeter,” an excerpt from a chapter in Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” could’ve used more bite."
8065,1,"Overall the film starts off on some rough waters, but once it gets down to Dracula going full terror on the sea versus a standout Corey Hawkins as the film’s hero, it’s riveting and heartbreaking."
8066,1,"Beyond being an exciting, effective and well-made horror, this is not an extravagant movie... [Full review in Spanish]"
8067,0,"What’s really gear-grinding is the depiction of Dracula himself, which is just frustrating in all the ways you’d expect a movie trying to make use of and differentiate itself from a hundred-or-so years of vampire films would be."
8068,0,"[The filmmakers] don't make the most of the claustrophobia of the ship, and at the same time, they don't give you the vast expanse of the seas, either."
8069,0,It just feels very stale and bland.
8070,1,"The writing, acting and production values are of an unexpected high quality reminiscent of the work of such old-school fright factories as Universal Studios in the 1930s-‘40s and Hammer Films of the 1960s."
8071,1,...a compelling premise that’s employed to watchable yet increasingly erratic effect...
8072,0,"The hey-great-idea feeling you might’ve entertained gets worn down quickly and thoroughly, and it’s hard not to come away with the sense that all the previous Draculas got it right by having most of the Demeter’s ordeal happen entirely off-screen."
8073,0,The Last Voyage of the Demeter expands a chapter of Dracula into a modest fright-gathering rather than a full-on frightfest.
8074,0,The Last Voyage of the Demeter doesn’t make enough of an impression to stand out amongst the veritable legions of other Dracula films that already exist.
8075,0,The whole production seems lost at sea.
8076,0,"To call The Last Voyage of the Demeter predictable is like calling Count Dracula a carnivore – absolutely self-evident, yet still underselling things just a bit."
8077,0,"If more concise, the Stockholm syndrome, some death choices, and the sheer hopelessness of being at sea with a thing you can’t combat would have been more effective."
8078,0,"Given that the director brought us one of the last truly scary movies, The Autopsy of Jane Doe,  you might think this one might have some chills and thrills - and it just doesn't. It drags on and on with no hint of spookiness until it's too late."
8079,1,"As this well-made movie is essentially an effective exercise in mood management, we are made to wait until the real star of the show makes his unpleasant presence felt... Traditionalists, however, will dig the slow and scenic route navigated here."
8080,1,"Although the movie does not reach its full potential, particularly with the paranoia aspect the premise offers, it remains a simple, effective nightmare. It’s bloody, exciting, and everything you would expect."
8081,0,"A film that never rises to the level of isolation it needs to develop genuine dread, too often sidelining Cunningham and Dastmalchian and becoming little more than serving up one character attack on deck and searching of limited confines in the daylight."
8082,0,The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a dull retread.
8083,1,...it turns out to be a clever enough side story that feels like a good flashback sequence in a show where we know what happens next.
8084,1,"What 'The Last Voyage of the Demeter' lacks in consistent thrills, it makes up in its serious and grizzly approach to a neutered sub-genre of horror."
8085,1,There are too many other good Dracula films to watch other than this flawed one.
8086,1,Atmospherics can carry a movie only so far and The Last Voyage of the Demeter sinks under the weight of its unrelieved gloom.
8087,0,An interesting premise but also a challenging one... because we know what happens.
8088,1,"It is, simply, just a movie about Dracula on a boat and that’s okay! That’s fun!"
8089,1,The Last Voyage of the Demeter is an atmospheric brutal creature feature hindered only by its scriptwriting.
8090,1,This movie is scary and the monster freaked me out. That is all.
8091,1,"While it has some flaws, it remains a well constructed horror movie that honors its source material. I imagine Stoker would be pleased."
8092,1,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter nails the atmosphere and overall feel of the time period, but the story just isn’t as interesting as the writers want it to be."
8093,1,What’s perhaps most pleasurable about The Last Voyage of the Demeter  is that it is unironic vampire horror.
8094,1,This bloody period horror film proves that vintage literary monsters are still downright frightening no matter your (or their) age.
8095,1,“Demeter” is as gripping as it is gruesome. It’s a dread-drenched stop on the Dracula timeline that has enough to please the iconic villain’s long-time fans and plenty to win over new ones as well.
8096,0,"It should’ve been an elaborately conceived thrill-kill horror, but it instead stays in one gear: day breaks, accusations are hurled, night falls, people die, repeat for nigh on two hours."
8097,0,"'Alien' meets 'Master and Commander' is a hell of a hook for a horror film, which leaves one wondering how they managed to screw it up so badly."
8098,1,[...] is The Last Voyage of the Demeter a shipwreck or a thrilling voyage? Let's call it a somewhat rocky journey that will leave some delighted and others reaching for the lifeboats.
8099,0,"Despite its technical prowess and its effective visual aesthetics, this predictable voyage doesn't manage to generate any thrills. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8100,0,"A tepid tale of terror aboard the ill-fated cargo ship that carried Dracula from Eastern Europe to Whitby, England kind of sucks."
8101,1,"The type of project that manages to lift itself up above the fray by sheer will and chops, not to mention its determination to scratch a throwback-genre itch."
8102,1,"After decades of neutering, it’s fun to once again encounter a vampire who is bestial and monstrous."
8103,1,"The makeup and practical effects are brilliantly executed, crafting gore and a creature that can fuel nightmares. While the pacing may be too slow in spots and this lacks a scary vibe, the acting and drama work to create a grimly dire film."
8104,1,"A perfect combination of gore and terror, “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” is a trip you definitely want to take if you are a horror film fan."
8105,1,"A terrific cast led by Corey Hawkins, chilling visuals, and a terrifying Dracula make this voyage worth taking."
8106,1,"The film is a great deal of insidious fun, and I have a sneaky suspicion that my fondness for it will only grow as I return to it again and again over the coming years."
8107,1,"It’s not the best Dracula film you’ll ever see, but it is a chilling new spin on the character, and a voyage horror fans will mostly be glad they took."
8108,1,"A formulaic yet effective take on the horror icon, Dracula. The Last Voyage of the Demeter nails the atmosphere, the creature design and the crew of this ship. An easy watch with potential for more in the future!"
8109,1,"No yo-ho-ho's here, though, or bottles of rum, either, as told from just one chapter of the late-19th century, Bram Stoker novel that introduced the ""Prince of Darkness"" and, eventually, bloodsucking as a spectator sport."
8110,0,"As the charred and barren Demeter finally lands on English shores, it’s hard not to get the sense that this underbaked and overlong film, like most of its crew, is largely dead on arrival."
8111,1,Spanish creature actor Javier Botet does an excellent job capturing Dracula’s unnatural movements and physique... accomplishing the complete opposite of Gary Oldman’s sensual fiend.
8112,1,Keeps the dark Gothic vibe of Bram Stoker's original work and doesn't give into the temptation of becoming too Hollywood.
8113,0,A great idea with few surprises and a muddled plot and murky cinematography.
8114,1,"André Øvredal directs, and while his palette is dark and murky and it’s often hard to discern who’s doing what to whom, he makes some terrifying choices that leave you wrecked, defying tired horror movie tropes."
8115,1,"A well-made, atmospheric chiller that nicely differentiates itself from other cinematic Dracula tales."
8116,0,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter wants to be Alien on the high seas, but drifts into shark week."
8117,1,"Staying true to the mysticism and the horror of the novel, director André Øvredal offers the audience a slow burn that is perhaps a little too slow."
8118,1,"If you're a Dracula fan, you absolutely should watch it."
8119,1,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a slow burn, claustrophobic atmosphere piece punctuated by occasional gouts of blood."
8120,0,The Last Voyage of the Demeter showed promise early on but failed to capitalize on the inherent horrors of its story.
8121,0,"'The Last Voyage of the Demeter' offers a few shudders and eye-catching creature effects, but sinks on its way to shore."
8122,1,"Told through the Captain's own logs, the horror film paints a brutal and bloodthirsty portrait of Dracula that is to be feared. The Last Voyage of the Demeter hits you like a stake through the heart; it's gruesome, scary, and unrelenting."
8123,1,"It builds an ever-increasing sense of dread with each new scene, but even more impressive is how shrewd it is, filling the screen with smart characters, sly twists, and a sense of morality."
8124,0,Smooth sailing it isn't.
8125,1,It’s all vigorously detailed and hair-raisingly enhanced with extraordinary computer-generated special effects.
8126,1,Voyage of the Demeter doesn't have enough scares to qualify as a great horror movie – and it is far too daft to work as a drama. But it scores as a showcase of technique and skills that are happily in resurgence.
8127,1,"Stylish, creepy and very gory takeoff on Bram Stoker's Dracula, fleshing out his trip across the ocean to England."
8128,1,"What truly distinguishes Last Voyage of the Demeter, beyond its thick atmosphere of dread, is its gleeful cruelty, the delicious mean streak with which it sets up its suspense set pieces and its kills."
8129,1,Here the classroom is the battlefield and dropping a drumstick feels just as devastating and crucial a moment as a grenade falling between your feet.
8130,1,"This is as much psychological thriller as musical drama and it turns on the increasingly toxic chemistry between two clearly damaged people, to the exclusion of pretty much anyone else in the film"
8131,1,"What does it mean to be great? I loved Whiplash because Damien Chazelle highlights the blood, sweat and tears that come along with pure devotion to one’s craft; the hard work when nobody’s there to pat you on the shoulder. The final scene…wow."
8132,1,What is essentially a thriller about jazz introduced the world to the rare talents of Damien Chazelle...
8133,1,Not quite sure why there's so much hype and praise on this one. I did enjoy it and thought JK and Miles had good performances but I didn't love it the way so many others did.
8134,1,"Fantastic performances that still hold up despite the problematic comments from J.K's character but he's meant to be that despicable, which is also why he won ALL the awards for this!"
8135,1,Damien Chazelle explores how much greatness is worth in Whiplash and manages to capture terrific performances in one of the best films of 2014.
8136,1,"Putting everything into your art or sport of choice has been the theme of many a dramatic motion picture, but few pour out their passions with such volatile intensity as Whiplash."
8137,1,"This is a rare treat combining remarkable acting, music, energy, and twists that will follow you out of the theater."
8138,1,There is not much to dislike about Whiplash. It is simply a pleasure to watch.
8139,1,"The film is stifling, stressful and brilliant, delving deep into the psychological richness of what happens when an ambitious young person in a prestigious environment meets a volatile instructor..."
8140,1,"Chazelle orchestrates his first feature like a pro, utilizing a snappy pace throughout."
8141,1,"The toxic mix of perfectionism, ambition and hubris meet in a perfect storm."
8142,1,It all ends on a triumphantly upbeat note that has the intensity to completely dominate every annoyance and dubious direction that came before it.
8143,1,"What makes musical genius? Is it inherent, or does it have to be dragged kicking, screaming and bleeding from you?"
8144,1,"Whiplash is exactly why films are made. It's powerful, moving, scary, gripping, thought-provoking, exhausting, inspiring and...in-%*@#ing-tense."
8145,1,"J.K. Simmons completely owns his role. It's scary, bordering psychotic and worth his Oscar win."
8146,1,"An energetic film about music, passion, sacrifice and the fine line between excellence and excess. [Full review in Spanish]"
8147,1,"The extraordinary thing about Whiplash, in addition to having a tremendous score, is that it plays the cymbals of the contemporary jazz scene with what would be masterful performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. [Full review in Spanish]"
8148,1,A terrific psychological thriller set in the emotionally shark-infested waters of an elite New York music academy...
8149,1,"Compelling, stunning and exhilarating, there are not enough superlatives to describe Whiplash and the impact of its lead performances."
8150,1,"Whiplash is a thrilling nailbiter that ruminates on the cost of great art, nature vs nurture and the sacrifices one makes for one's craft..."
8151,1,"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and Whiplash hits so hard it'll leave you on life support, gasping for breath."
8152,1,All the music scenes are done incredibly well and it builds tension to a very satisfying ending.
8153,1,"A supreme meditation on the encouragement of brilliance and the excesses of power, Whiplash is a stunning musical drama with a rhythm section to die for."
8154,1,"If it wasn't for the stellar performances by both Simmons and Teller, I'm not sure this film would actually work."
8155,1,"It's one of 2014's best films, an emotional powerhouse that features one of the most memorable performances in recent memory."
8156,0,A dramatic conceit around which so-called truisms about the destructive quest for artistic perfection can play out.
8157,0,"The advertising boasts words like 'riveting' and 'astounding.' Sadly, I was neither riveted nor astounded."
8158,1,It's a necessary cautionary tale for anyone aspiring to greatness that never sugar coats itself for one moment.
8159,1,"If occasionally the movie works too hard to manufacture dramatic points, that's easy enough to forgive in the face of the performances writer-director Damien Chazelle (Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench) draws from his stars."
8160,1,Electrifying. Dangerous. Masterful.
8161,1,It takes Simmons as an actor from memorable to unforgettable.
8162,1,"""Whiplash"" is a standout film of the year that will remind you what filmmaking is supposed to be."
8163,1,The terrific acting duo of Teller and Simmons infuses the lively antagonism between coach and pupil with practically combustible fuel.
8164,1,"If you're anything like me, you'll leave the theatre trembling to the rhythm of jazz drums. [Full review in Spanish]"
8165,1,... intoxicating movie. [Full review in Spanish]
8166,1,"Whiplash is cinema as a duel, fought not in an army barracks or an athletic training camp but in the room where the orchestra rehearses its jazz numbers."
8167,1,Whiplash is must-see cinema filled with explosive performances from Miles Teller and J.K Simmons
8168,1,"Chazelle has a winning conceit in the bond between the self-annihilating hero and his psychopathic mentor, wringing surprising tension out of an improbable magic-realist finale that sees the men hashing out their demonic teacher-student relationship."
8169,1,The taut editing (Tom Cross) is outstanding and Simmons outdoes himself.
8170,1,"Like a classic jazz tune, this movie takes a simple theme -- what is an acceptable price for artistic greatness? -- and with the application of craftsmanship and imagination, that slim starting idea is built into something approaching greatness."
8171,1,"Without guns, knives or fistfights, Whiplash manages to be explosive and yes, dramatically violent - it's just that the violence is largely emotional, and often self-inflicted."
8172,1,[Chazelle] concocts a finale that contains an unlikely plot twist and which arguably counters everything the rest of the film has warned us about. But it includes a musical performance so dazzling and exhilarating that it's hard to complain.
8173,0,"The film has potential, but ultimately there's more bark than bite."
8174,1,"Whiplash is a well made film, expertly edited and performed with aplomb, but it's a little bit ridiculous."
8175,0,"[Miles] Teller and [J.K] Simmons give stellar performances, making this twisted relationship between teacher and student always compelling, even as the plot strains believability more than once."
8176,1,"The movie is bursting with grand jazz sets, some classic, some not. All of them pure pleasure, especially if you love jazz."
8177,1,Simply outstanding.
8178,1,"Revealing both the dangers and payoffs of artistic ambition, Whiplash is sure to establish Chazelle as a directorial force to be reckoned with."
8179,1,"This is not a music movie-the numbers are dense and joyless-it's a sports movie, and a very assured one for a guy clearly reaching for the stars himself."
8180,1,"It's about the social utility of sociopathy, about the refusal to fret over self-esteem or hurt feelings or mental or physical pain in the pursuit of greatness."
8181,1,"It's a thorny, thoughtful movie that asks provocative questions and isn't cocky enough to boast of knowing the answers."
8182,1,"It's a riveting, thrilling film that gets away with an ending that's perhaps just a little too keen to cleanly resolve the jagged drama. But if you ever thought Glee or Fame would be better rendered as a one-on-one psycho-thriller, here's your film."
8183,1,"Fast-paced, intelligent and highly entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
8184,1,"[Writer-director Damien] Chazelle has turned an overwrought, often tasteless musical cliche - the drum solo - into something ferocious and alive."
8185,1,"Exciting, nerve-racking and emotionally pungent all at once."
8186,1,Whiplash feels dynamic and fresh because it capitalizes on every tonal shift and detail.
8187,1,Whiplash is the most exciting thing that has happened to us in 2015. [Full review in Spanish]
8188,1,"At only 29, writer/director Damien Chazelle is already a huge talent, allowing both his leads to shine as the film builds to its powerful and beautifully conducted finale. Whether you're a fan of drumming-based cinema or not you need to see it."
8189,1,"Writer-director Damien Chazelle, who previously co-scripted ""The Last Exorcism Part II,"" ascribes horror characteristics to a naturalistic story masterfully so that they are effective but never intrusive or gratuitous."
8190,1,The film offers up a breathless battle of wills that inspire a whirlwind of emotions before leaving you on an exhilarated high.
8191,1,"It's a musical, a sports movie and an 'inspirational teacher' movie rolled into one -- and it subverts the clichés of all those genres."
8192,1,"Awash with buckets of blood, sweat and tears, Whiplash is a visceral vision of the quest for artistic perfection."
8193,1,Go and see Whiplash. It's as simple as that. Whiplash is incredible. I really can't believe how good Whiplash is. I can't stop telling people about Whiplash.
8194,0,Could have easily been a sports film.
8195,0,"There's an energy that's undeniably spellbinding, but it feels too hollow."
8196,0,"The movie is a sleek machine. It's viscerally thrilling, and distressingly hollow."
8197,1,Whiplash finds the perfect amount of discomfort between emotional abuse and artistic glory.
8198,1,"Whiplash rises on the strengths of a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance from J.K. Simmons and a great soundtrack to complement it, turning what could have been a rather bland story of a determined drummer into something a little more memorable."
8199,1,'Whiplash' is whip-smart.
8200,0,"full of skill and technique and fury, but hollow at the core."
8201,1,Utterly brilliant and intense.
8202,1,This is a movie you cannot forget. No wonder the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for Oscars in five categories.
8203,1,J.K. Simmons excels in 'Whiplash's' hand-to-the throat storytelling.
8204,1,The acting is what drums up the interest here. J.K. Simmons proves -- as most of us already know -- he's a great actor and deserves more than acting for an insurance company.
8205,1,Whiplash delivers a dark and dazzling jive into the hidden world of competitive playing. This is what happens when the kids from Fame meet the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket.
8206,1,As close to a perfect film as you're likely to see.
8207,0,A more distasteful rendering of character and story I can't begin to imagine. I must be missing something.
8208,1,"Miles Teller's Andrew pounds the drum skins as if his life depended on it. With J K Simmons' chair chucker Fletcher around, it very nearly might."
8209,1,"For all its overripe contrivance, you'll leave the cinema with a spring in your step and a thump in your chest, eager to bang the drum for what deserves to be one of the year's real word-of-mouth hits."
8210,1,"Chazelle, training a keen eye on the proceedings, seems to delight in the spectacle of relentless punishment."
8211,1,"What gives the film such a kick, in spite of its improbabilities, is its raw and brutal but also very subtle portrayal of the shifting, attritional relations between teacher and student, sorcerer and apprentice."
8212,1,"I suggest you take a defibrillator to Whiplash, since the chances of a heart attack or spontaneous combustion during viewing are high."
8213,1,Whiplash moves at a whipcrack pace that takes its rhythmic cues from drumming (some of the cuts are as fast as the beats in a Buddy Rich solo).
8214,1,Few relationships in recent cinema have been quite so compelling. Bring a welder's mask to ward off sparks.
8215,1,"If you didn't think music could involve actual blood, sweat, and tears, this breathtakingly visceral coming-of-artistic-age drama will set you straight."
8216,1,Simmons is unnervingly good as a teacher who rules by fear and the final showdown provides as gripping a climax as you will see all year.
8217,1,"Compelling, compulsive and excruciatingly funny, you can't take your eyes off the screen."
8218,1,"Whiplash is an extraordinarily taut, accomplished piece of work for a debut feature. It's also unusual in having such a definite point to make - albeit perhaps a pretty objectionable one."
8219,1,"A hugely entertaining, refreshingly subversive take on the well-worn ""inspirational teacher"" theme."
8220,1,"Come the last beat, you'll probably be exhausted. But you'll also feel entertained, inspired and wonderfully alive. The ovation starts here."
8221,1,"In a nutshell: Judged on its own merits, Whiplash is superb: slick, authentic and infectious."
8222,1,"The film offers dark, ripsnorting fun if not, necessarily, an accurate portrait of life and times at premium music colleges."
8223,1,It's hard to think of another film that leaves us quite so out of breath.
8224,1,"If Facebook's Marc Zuckerberg took jazz drumming lessons from Dr Hannibal Lecter, the result might look like this."
8225,1,Whiplash is razor-sharp filmmaking about personal sacrifice and how far you're willing to go in pursuit of a dream. It's absolutely essential viewing.
8226,1,Builds to a finale that's somehow fist-pumpingly fantastic and utterly tragic at the same time. You'll want back for more as soon as it's over.
8227,1,"Not many films can capture electricity and bottle it, but Damien Chazelle is a conductor par excellence. If the final scene doesn't move you in every sense, you're a corpse."
8228,1,"Tense, hilarious, harrowing, brilliantly performed and masterfully directed."
8229,1,"Yes, Donnie Yen plays another blind character (my theory is that filmmakers do this because nobody would buy that a Donnie Yen with two functioning eyes could ever lose a fight)."
8230,1,"You might have seen some of it before, but it has never been as big and brash as it is in this chapter... an action epic for the ages."
8231,1,Genuine cinematic poetry.
8232,1,John Wick 4 is the ultimate action movie.
8233,1,"The action is fluid and all-consuming and makes it easy to overlook some of the story’s shortcomings (too many new threads, not so seamlessly woven in)."
8234,1,It is an incredible ride that is designed to entertain from the opening moments and the best way to enjoy it is to just hang on.
8235,1,"This series always did a stellar job of not turning John Wick into a robotic machine, and Reeves always maintained a depth to this haunted character. The tenderness of a classically Reeves-ian performance is what is missing in John Wick: Chapter 4."
8236,1,"They understand that it is the characters, the humour, and the jaw-dropping action that keeps us coming back for more. And as long as they keep this up, even in the form of spin-offs, audiences will continue to lap it up."
8237,1,John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers a satisfying conclusion to an outstanding action franchise that never fails to impress with its stylish action sequences and portrayal of an intriguing world of assassins and codes of conduct.
8238,1,Joins both Mad Max and Mission: Impossible in the action franchise hall of fame in the wing of films that somehow keep getting more thrilling and more beautiful to look at amidst the ballet of carnage in its breathless set pieces.
8239,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 concludes the game-changing saga with a relentless, ruthless action masterclass that ultimately justifies its epic length."
8240,1,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the best entry since the original, and it knows the mileage on John's soul is starting to reveal itself more and more. So, it smartly plans for a narrative exit ramp."
8241,1,Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski return with trusted collaborators to their neon labyrinth featuring elevated action and a cast of adversaries and allies to create the most John Wick film in the franchise.
8242,1,"The entire series is a sisyphean journey of revenge. The audience knows that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) can never be free from this life of an assassin. He’s doomed to climb that 222-step staircase to Sacre-Cœur in Paris, both physically and metaphorically."
8243,1,A Bonafide Action MASTERPIECE.   Cementing John Wick as one of the greatest Action Franchises of all time. Once you think you’ve seen the coolest sequence it only gets better up until the final 30 minutes which completely had my jaw on the floor.
8244,1,"With John Wick Chapter 4, Chad Stahelski crafts a grand sculpture of gunplay, feverishly yet methodically chiseled until its ultimate, explosive completion. A violent, ferocious symphony that encapsulates the very reason why we go to the movies."
8245,1,"From the cinematography, an atmospheric score in all the right places, to a powerful conclusion in Wick’s personal’s story – it ends the franchise in the best way it ever could."
8246,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 doesn’t feel like the fourth film of a franchise; it’s an exclamation point, a high watermark for action cinema as a whole."
8247,1,"The world’s most deadly wife-guy returns to inflict his brand of elaborately choreographed mayhem on anyone that’s left to get in his way. If we have indeed seen John Wick’s final headshot, it’s a well-executed conclusion."
8248,1,"... in epic fashion, everything that occurred before has led to this exact destination, creating within the narrative a sense of pre-destination and inevitability."
8249,1,"Sensational stunts, rigorous physical blocking and camera choreography, judicious but satisfying gore, and an incongruous nod to Frogger—good stuff, Mr. Wick."
8250,1,"This might be the most impressive John Wick film since the original, one that balances its bombastic fight sequences with plenty of compelling lore and surprising emotion. Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins steal the show."
8251,1,The best film in the John Wick action collection.
8252,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is effective in every aspect, even when it demonstrates its faults at a full glance."
8253,1,"As a franchise, John Wick offers viewers a lot and does it well.  The 4K release lives up to expectations and is a must for any John Wick fan."
8254,0,"By trading brains for bullets and characters for puppets, the director made the worst possible choices for this exhausting fourth chapter."
8255,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 packs in everything we love about John Wick, from high style to mysterious assassins to dogs to car chases to foot chases to a Looney Tunes level of gunplay. It’s the whole kitchen sink tossed on fire into oncoming traffic."
8256,1,The latest installment of the John Wick franchise offers a vast canvas for stunt work and action choreography with a sincere and brooding Keanu Reeves as the anchor.
8257,1,"The film’s runtime is probably its greatest flaw, but watching Wick and Yen battle it out is well worth the price of admission."
8258,1,"I can’t say whether John Wick: Chapter 4 is better or less-good than the other Wicks, but it’s easily the funniest – and that reflects the restless creativity of its makers."
8259,0,The John Wick series comes to an anti-climactic and thoroughly interminable close with this absolutely endless entry...
8260,1,An exhilarating action film that takes itself and its bizarre world seriously.
8261,1,"Not sure exactly how badly we needed a fourth John Wick installment, but it is always a fun ride."
8262,1,This pulp one was more entertaining than the others in the series.
8263,1,"While Tom Cruise is jumping bikes off a ramp in Norway, Reeves is whipping reverse 180s on a famous circle drive in Paris while shooting bad guys. That’s him doing just about every ounce of stunt work and fight choreography. He’s in a league of his own."
8264,1,"The whole arc, with its excesses and ridiculousness, ends up closing –but above all, it seems to condense– not only the leit motifs of the saga, but almost everything that has been choreographically action cinema of the last 20 years."
8265,1,"Translation: We can consider ourselves fortunate, because this self-aware delight, committed to the cause of relentless entertainment, has transformed cinematic action into a true work of art."
8266,1,"The fight scenes are so kinetic, so recklessly energetic and just so much fun that the three hours fly by like so many bullets whizzing past Wick’s head."
8267,1,Please don't stop making John Wick movies anytime soon.
8268,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 benefits by knowing what it is and holding fast to what works. Clean visuals, blistering action, streamlined plot progression, and cutting-edge stuntwork."
8269,1,"John Wick 4 is a masterclass in action movies. Chad Stahelski brings his absolute best game to this film, with action sequences that leave you in awe.   With incredible stunts, sets and cinematography, it’s one of the best films of the year thus far."
8270,1,"Sit back, relax, mind the language, and see fight scenes to dazzle the eye."
8271,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is not just the magnum opus of the series, it actually corrects a problem that the series has had for a while, a question we haven’t had an answer for over the last couple of films.  What does John Wick want?"
8272,1,"“John Wick: Chapter 4” is by far the strongest film of the franchise with some of the best action in film history. The rewatchability factor will demand multiple viewings, and after seeing this movie, your eyes and mind will never be the same."
8273,1,It's up to par with all the other films in the franchise. There were moments when you could laugh. Moments where you could cry. Highly enjoyable!
8274,1,Its less like a [three-hour] fight sequence and more like an incredibly bonkers ballet
8275,1,"The best film in the series, featuring four or five action set pieces that are breathtaking."
8276,1,"There isn’t much dialogue because there never is in a movie involving hitman Wick. Once again, Keanu Reeves plays him with as much taciturn moodiness as possible. He’s sullen, silent, and strong through 169 relentlessly supercharged minutes."
8277,1,"""John Wick 4"" hits the mark. This grand ballet of mayhem and ultra-violence goes on a bit too long but is never dull. The story threads aren’t the most complex, but Keanu and friends commit to the action and it’s stellar."
8278,1,"Clocking in at a hefty 169 minutes, the fourth Wick movie spreads its wings and goes full-blown epic. Every single shot is a dazzler, it has a surefooted pace, and the simple story is elevated to mythical status."
8279,1,"... Overkill in more ways than one. All that said, there are some extraordinary fight sequences, leavened with cherishable wit."
8280,1,"I wasn't sure the Wickiverse could ever top ""knife museum"" but then they handed our man John a pair of nunchucks and...well..."
8281,1,"I wasn't sure the Wickiverse could ever top ""knife museum"" but then they gave our man John a pair of nunchucks and...well..."
8282,1,"No matter how a John Wick movie finishes, it ends with viewers wanting more — and this is no exception, including more of Yen as Caine alongside Keanu."
8283,1,Who knew the Wickiverse was a (murderous) utopia?
8284,0,"A nearly three-hour orgy of mayhem that’s flashy, raucous, brainless and as nutritious as a Twinkie.  But fans will eat it up and, like Oliver Twist, ask for more.  Others might feel not just glutted by the excess but somewhat nauseated by it."
8285,0,"If there were an Oscar for ""best headshot effects"" this movie would win it.  And its over the top, senseless and overly long plot would lost it every other accolade possible."
8286,0,"Emphasizing spectacle over substance at every slow-motion turn while trying to constantly outdo itself, this ambitious sequel feels like a director’s cut that could have benefited from some judicious trimming."
8287,1,The strongest chapter in the Wick saga and of the best Hollywood action films of all time! The magnetic characters -especially Donnie Yen- anchor the brutal and beautiful torrent of mayhem. [Full Review in Spanish]
8288,1,"One last fever dream of violence and mayhem, giving viewers a final chance to watch John Wick seek the kind of revenge on the wealthy and all-powerful that we all dream about."
8289,1,"The Godfather II of action movies. Blisteringly entertaining, and packed with some of the best action and fight sequences ever put on film"
8290,1,"Somehow retains the sense of basicness that led the original to such prominence, whilst layering itself with the operatic expansion of its near-video game-like ultimation."
8291,1,It's a fantastic finale (maybe) for a favorite franchise.
8292,1,John Wick: Chapter 4 is still entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
8293,1,The fourth film in the very entertaining John Wick series delivers lots more action and even some affecting consequences.
8294,1,"Energised by a swaggering electro-rock score, this is pulp cinema at its most giddy and gleeful."
8295,1,Bring on the stunt people- John Wick is back in town.
8296,1,"An absolutely excellent, masterful final lap for the series with Reeves dedicating himself to the action movie art form."
8297,1,"This installment of the series offers nearly three hours of action, humor (a 4DX bonus), and sweeping landscapes. All come with high kill and diversity scores. There's also an Easter egg for East Asians."
8298,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks."
8299,1,"It's impossible not to applaud the audacity in opening the movie with a reference to Lawrence of Arabia and ending it with one to The Warriors, not fearing comparison despite the prejudice with which the genre is seen by many. [Full review in Portuguese]"
8300,1,"A brutal fourth installment, which offers the right dose of action almost at the same level as the previous chapters. [Full review in Spanish]"
8301,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 did not need to be nearly as long as it is, but in this case, the excess is the point. Much of it is ridiculous and ridiculously violent, but it’s also highly entertaining, which is all you can hope for from this type of film."
8302,1,"After this installment, it’s hard to see how another sequel would even be necessary beyond Reeves and Stahelski challenging themselves to make something close to one of the greatest action spectacles of all time."
8303,1,"Chapter 4 is resoundingly the best Wick sequel – but I still prefer cold-blooded efficiency over bloody excess, no matter how artfully and, at times, playfully staged."
8304,1,"Aside from spectacular fights, it really doesn't have much else to recommend it. There is little character development, and the story is kind of loopy. But you know what you are going to get with this kind of film, and it does deliver what it promises."
8305,1,"The meal itself is entertaining and a testament to stunt craft, but it's probably the weakest of the franchise in terms of overall success. Thankfully, that's still good enough."
8306,1,"Caps off what I think we have to regard, at this point, as the best and most-consistent action franchise in American cinema history."
8307,1,The first  great blockbuster of 2023 and one of the greatest action films I've ever seen.
8308,1,"This movie did not disappoint, and the bar was high... It's creme of the crop premier action."
8309,1,"JWC4 is an elaborately choregraphed, gorgeously crafted slaughter fest. A blood-thirsty spectacle. A circus of scoundrels fighting to the death in the most gracefully violent ways."
8310,1,"It's wild and bombastic...from a directional standpoint, I think this is Stahelski's best work so far in the series."
8311,1,"[Is the film] a profoundly inane exercise in empty violence or a transcendent ballet replacing exposition with movement? ... To quote Wick, ""Yeah."""
8312,1,"Way cool, and way too damned long."
8313,1,"Whatever happens next, Reeves and co have their work cut out to top John Wick: Chapter 4."
8314,1,"Just think: All this carnage, all this fun, all for the want of a dog. Few can beat that."
8315,1,It’s a great way to spend an afternoon at the cinema and worth the price of admission.
8316,1,"The final 45 minutes of the film includes three set pieces that, while interesting and certainly fun to watch, frequently push the laws of probability and physics far beyond their breaking points."
8317,1,"John Wick: Chapter 4 won’t win over any doubters, but it will please the fans. If it is the end to the films series (a TV show is in the works), this caps off a thrilling and consistently entertaining franchise in the best way it can."
8318,1,They give John Wick nunchucks in this one. That's my review of 'John Wick Chapter 4.'
8319,1,"It was such a thrilling, immersive experience. With its high octane action and breathtaking stunt choreography."
8320,1,"A tantalising offering to an already solid franchise. Slick action, scrumptious visuals and top tier cast additions made this an epic ride!"
8321,1,"No easy feat for a franchise that’s attempted to top itself with each subsequent film, but Chapter 4 celebrates everything that’s made these movies work so well for this long."
8322,1,It's unrelenting and relentless... it is epic.
8323,1,"Reeves gives more of the super-chill guy we love, though the most fun looks to be had by Skarsgard whose Marquis dresses in immaculate costuming. He camps and vamps through his role."
8324,1,"Across an enormous running time, the film builds up a compelling tale of revenge and redemption that's unusually involving. And of course it looks fabulous, with colourful design touches and outrageously intricate fight choreography."
8325,1,"Almost 10 years later, the John Wick franchise is still delivering the most unbelievable action sequences in film in recent years. This time around the universe building is more important than the otherwise bland main character. [Full review in Spanish]"
8326,1,Nearly three hours of John Wick? You’re gonna need a bigger popcorn.
8327,0,"Interesting elements [are stretched] far too thin with bloated, excessive fighting sequences ... The gratuitous violence and commando shooting do not offend me, but the film's superfluous, meandering runtime certainly does."
8328,1,Everything you'd want out of an action movie!
8329,1,The Last Duel is really the best of both worlds: action-packed and devoted to the right side of history.
8330,0,"Rashomon may have inspired the story, but this is like the paper that Rashomon came wrapped in, a costume drama with modern relevance detailed in a highlighter pen. Everyone is locked up in the tragedy of their circumstances, but you don’t feel it."
8331,1,"Ridley Scott’s best film in awhile. An epic, brutal, but intimate at its heart/soul of its story. A lot of this comes thanks to a fascinating script that brings a unique structure to the entire story."
8332,1,"The actual duel is one of the most nerve-wracking sequences of the last few years, compensating the audience's patience with a satisfying climax."
8333,1,"In The Last Duel, Comer does a magnificent job of portraying a smart, sensitive female trapped in a world where she is considered merely the property of a male."
8334,1,"With the stakes set so high, Scott rises to the challenge and delivers a brutal, visceral “last duel” with complex narrative designs and a phenomenal carousel of performances."
8335,1,"It’s troublesome, and thematically counterintuitive, that the violence is more believable than the on-the-nose manner in which the film handles discussion of the sexual assault; fortunately, both elements are equal in their lack of subtlety."
8336,1,"Though slightly hobbled by its script’s unconventional style, The Last Duel soars when the sensational Jodie Comer takes center stage in the third act."
8337,0,"Despite a stellar cast, a legendary director and a potentially interesting storytelling structure, the film itself fails to deliver on its stated purpose or provide adequate entertainment to overlook its shortcomings."
8338,1,"The movie hits the mark, this has always happened, and things haven't changed much. [Full review in Spanish]"
8339,1,It's Comer who shines the brightest in this film. She gives Marguerite a strong and powerful backbone that allows her to stand up for what's right and for all women.
8340,1,"THE LAST DUEL is a super immersive production, brought to life by powerhouse performances, thats brutal and entertaining, as well as thought-provoking. Simply a great package."
8341,1,"The Last Duels long runtime and grim subject matter may make it a difficult watch, but ... this is a brutal and highly effective historical drama that explores gender dynamics and egomania in a way thats depressingly still topical."
8342,1,Ridley Scott is still at the top of his game and the film gives Comer the iconic and impressive role needed to define a career.
8343,1,Scott hasn't felt this engaged in his material for many years.
8344,0,"Jodie Comer single-handedly carries ""The Last Duel,"" while her co-actors (Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, and Adam Driver) flail."
8345,0,"The Last Duel is certainly smart enough to satisfy. For those who see its game and hope it has something more to say than what it is, heres hoping this isnt the final word."
8346,1,The climactic combat is motivated more by the knight's ego than by his concern for the welfare and honor of his wife.
8347,1,"While certain sequences will be uncomfortable, Ridley Scott's ability to tell a period story that is so relevant today is uncanny."
8348,0,"It feels manipulated... a plot imposed upon a documentary to imply more than is on the page, a trap like the one Marguerite creates for herself to wait and watch as others decide her fate -- right along with the audience."
8349,1,"""The Last Duel"" is a movie that will stay with you long afterwards for its heavy material. Expect to hear this film's name come Oscar time."
8350,1,"Depending on who you talk to, the film is either one of the worst or one of the best films to be underseen in 2021, which, I think, goes to show just how much perspective matters in real or imagined life."
8351,1,"Ridley Scott delivers one of his best works in years with this brutal, righteous, superbly acted historical drama."
8352,1,Jodie Comer delivers an incredible performance. I appreciated the three varying perspectives....a reminder that not everyone interprets or thinks similarly.
8353,1,"Truth, power and honor are put into question in this timely drama, led by Jodie Comer's astounding performance. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8354,0,Witness the abject failure of Ridley Scott's The Last Duel. We can't blame the poor old millennials this time - the film was terrible. And I'm not even talking about the ridiculous mullets and Ben Affleck playing himself.
8355,1,The Last Duel captures our interest from its beginning to almost its end. A great film led by Matt Damon and Adam Driver and very well told by Ridley Scott. [Full review in Spanish] [Full review in Spanish] [Full review in Spanish
8356,1,"A layered, if uneasy watch."
8357,1,It may have under-performed in cinemas [...] but I have no doubt that time will be kind to The Last Duel. It is a superb work.
8358,1,"Don't expect an action-packed epic like ""Gladiator;"" this film is more like ""Rashomon,"" depicting three contradictory accounts of an alleged crime, allowing director Ridley Scott to show different perspectives via camera angles and reaction shots."
8359,1,"The drama overall is a tad stagey, but Scott's climactic set piece is spectacular: brutal, gory and impeccably choreographed."
8360,1,Trust us when we say this is a cinematic epic.
8361,0,"The subject matter of The Last Duel doesn't necessarily lend itself to repeat viewings, as essentially a medieval #MeToo film."
8362,1,"It is, in many ways, an admirable film; it is, in most ways, a very handsome and well-made film... But in almost no ways at all is it a watchable film."
8363,1,Scott makes a splendid return to the dramatic epic of historical character. [Full review in Spanish]
8364,1,Surprisingly tough and rough stuff from all involved.
8365,1,"It's a well-crafted film by old vet Scott, with a script by Damon, Ben Affleck and Nicole Holofcener that taps into the oppressive inequities of the time, namely wealth manipulation by the few and the concept of women as property."
8366,1,The craft is too good to deny alongside strong performances within the problematic and repetitive material.
8367,1,"It's a strange, long horror comedy about how women in the 14th century were at the mercy of dudes who were vain, petty, and cruel, only concerned with their own status even when someone's life is at stake."
8368,1,"It's a rough watch, but it was it was solid. It's just a lot to take in."
8369,0,"It's based on a true story from history, but rather than liven up the past the film threatens instead to drown in its own uneven intentions."
8370,1,[Ridley Scott] is one of the most expert and creative directors making period cinema. [Full review in Spanish]
8371,0,"A film that champions itself as having feminist themes also puts its heroine's story in the backseat, while placing more importance on the action-packed, bloody fight to the death. Shhh, dear: the men are dueling."
8372,1,What we see with both men are two conflicting versions of chivalry that are hardly more than masks of self-interest.
8373,1,"Offering a glimpse into an era rarely depicted on screen, The Last Duel tells a worthy tale."
8374,1,"A different kind of epic, both in tone and structure, that declares war on a patriarchal system that refuses to die. [Full review in Spanish]"
8375,1,"Not this director's usual driving narrative, but the familiar fabulously immersive experience with characters prepared to stake their lives over what is right and wrong,"
8376,1,"""The Last Duel"" is an involving costume saga that should resonate with the ""Me Too"" generation."
8377,0,"If anything, the fact that Marguerite's perspective is last, and overshadowed by the duel itself, does a disservice."
8378,0,...sporadically compelling yet ultimately disappointing...
8379,1,Brings us back to a [Ridley] Scott committed to exploring deep truths about human nature. [Full review in Spanish]
8380,1,"Scott is one of the great cinematic craftsmen of his time. His gift for building immersive, layered, far-reaching screen worlds is unsurpassed."
8381,1,A decently executed film that entertains without dazzle.
8382,1,"It's Comer who saves it from being a cold, intellectual exercise in storytelling. The subtle modulations in her performance within each segment is more effective than the film's violent ending."
8383,1,"Despite its pacing and repetition, there is enough in The Last Duel to keep you hooked until its physically and emotionally brutal ending."
8384,1,"This historical drama has excessive violence and some gore too, but in the heart is about a woman unknowingly becoming the flagbearer for a new movement for people speaking against sexual assault."
8385,1,"Ridley Scott's latest movie may be set in the 1380s, but it taps hard into the current debate that the MeToo movement has sought to expose."
8386,1,"Director Ridley Scott puts the audience right there in the duel, complete with clanging armor."
8387,1,"All in all, the most interesting thing about the film is when Scott brings its operatic side to the fore and presents us with bloody medieval battles. [Full review in Spanish]"
8388,1,The Last Duel doesn't hide it's affection for Japanese cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
8389,1,"It's not until the back half of ""The Last Duel"" that the true star emerges, and that's Comer."
8390,1,The Last Duel doesn't shy away from the casual cruelty of the characters and their craven aspects.
8391,1,"It's tempting to think ""The Last Duel"" should have just been Marguerite's account, but so much of the film's pleasure is seeing Damon, Affleck and Driver gradually dismantle and even lampoon their own charms."
8392,1,The Last Duel is as slyly observant as it is gut-wrenching.
8393,1,Jodie Comer is a spectacular and subtle [Marguerite de Carrouges]. [Full review in Spanish]
8394,1,"The first two thirds of the film are effectively drawn, but they pale in comparison [to the better third] because they possess incomplete rather than alternative information."
8395,1,The real driving force to turn this very-good movie into a must see is Jodie Comer. [Full Review in Spanish]
8396,1,Masterful. [Full Review in Spanish]
8397,1,"A brutal, harrowing, intriguing, stunningly well-made film that will linger in your thoughts for quite some time."
8398,1,"The bloody realism of the combat contrasts a somewhat less convincing staging, what anachronistic and sometimes careless details marring the dialogues and performances. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8399,1,Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are back with a blockbuster of a film!
8400,1,The Last Duel is overflowing with virtually every filmmaking tool found in director Ridley Scott's formidable creative wheelhouse.
8401,1,The Lady Reigns Supreme
8402,1,"Comer dominates the screen, particularly when it is her character's turn at the mic to tell her tale. Reserved and moderated, Comer imbues Marguerite with humanity seldom seen from female roles in historical epics such as this."
8403,1,There's rarely much of a sense here of what [medieval] life was actually like - a fatal flaw in a drama that hinges on highlighting the differences and similarities between that time and ours.
8404,0,"This bloody medieval swordfight movie's three-chapter structure is both an asset and a hindrance. At times, it seems to deepen the story, but it also feels repetitive and moves in graceless, blocky chunks."
8405,0,The Last Duel is not a terrible film. I am sure many will enjoy it but the story structure sank it for me. No thanks
8406,1,"The Last Duel is a big screen experience if ever there was one and, for the most part, a pretty impressive one."
8407,1,"The Ridley Scott-directed, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck-cowritten film is a fascinating text full of spectacle and ideas worth chewing on."
8408,1,"Pieces of The Last Duel seem like they'd make for one of the year's best movies, but they're a jumbled whole."
8409,1,"Scott has never shied away from the more gruesome aspects of whatever story he happens to be telling and this time the savagery is extreme, clanking armour and all."
8410,1,The Last Duel is a remarkable outing from a veteran director who approaches a genre he knows well with a wholly new lens forged in the modern-day.
8411,1,"The Last Duel sees Scott in top form. His film is oozing with exquisite period detail, captivating characters, and good old-fashioned storytelling."
8412,1,"Damon, Affleck, and co-writer Nicole Holofcener have crafted a series of fascinating and rich characters, each handsomely performed by their respective player, who has complete and complex psychologies behind each of their decisions."
8413,1,"A novelistic device -- three characters, three points of view -- has been assembled with crafty detailing by co-writers Nicole Holofcener, Affleck and Damon, with Eric Jager's historical novel providing the building blocks."
8414,1,The unexpected MVP of The Last Duel is Ben Affleck.
8415,1,"It is a movie that demands a lot of its audience...emotionally and intellectually exhausting...Yes, it is messy and overwrought at times, but it ultimately proves to be a powerful and provocative work of big-budget cinema."
8416,0,The Last Duel reduces the concept's fruitful insights into didactic handholding.
8417,1,"Scott's best film in many a moon, and what a treat it is to see him once again painting confidently on such a grand and sweeping canvas."
8418,1,"Brilliantly acted and cleverly written, it exerts a powerful grip for every second of its two-and-a-half hour running time."
8419,1,"Ultimately it's a solid film, but not as important as the discussions it sparks."
8420,0,"For all its pretensions to modern-day relevance, all there really is to learn from The Last Duel is that Sir Ridley is still more comfortable watching his boys shout and wave their swords at each other, than... really listening to what a woman has to say."
8421,1,"A 14th century morality saga with present-day resonance, this sweeping epic features both big drama and massively brutal action."
8422,0,"""The Last Duel"" might work better as a silent film."
8423,1,"For a film that doesn't exactly deal in narrative nuances, The Last Duel is remarkably deft with its exploration of Marguerite's rape."
8424,0,"Clearly, the filmmakers intend for viewers to learn something by watching Marguerite's tale. But what's the point of telling it in this manner? And does it tie up the tale in a too-neat bow?"
8425,1,"Based on a true story, 'The Last Duel's' parallels to modern society and misogyny are unmistakable."
8426,1,The Last Duel isn't the most obvious script from Damon and Affleck ( ... ) but their collective intelligence and wit keeps the film at a topical forefront whilst simultaneously reminding us of their performative strength.
8427,1,"An admittedly tough watch, The Last Duel is a compelling and bruising movie fuelled by a fearless performance from Jodie Comer."
8428,1,"If action and war were the sole focus of 'The Last Duel,' it would be a glorious success. But it reaches for a grander message of prejudice and sexism without the gravitas or nuance to hit its intended target."
8429,1,"Sorogoyen handles the tension perfectly, leaving the viewer always expecting what the next move of the terrifying brothers played by the two magnificent Zahera and Anido will be. [Full review in Spanish]"
8430,1,The Beasts is seductive and captivating because Alejandro de Pablo makes a photographic work that is as poetic as it is functional. [Full review in Spanish]
8431,1,"Impressive in its setting, positive outlook, and in its reference to character development. [Full review in Spanish]"
8432,1,...a profoundly upsetting story given a gripping treatment...
8433,1,"A slow-burn Spanish thriller hissing with menacing energy and brilliant performances [...] Beautifully shot yet spiritually ugly, [it] plunges us straight into an atmosphere of crackling social tension that never abates."
8434,1,"The Beasts trades on topics so current it feels like watching the news. While not quite a re-enactment, this superb thriller takes inspiration from oh-so-many immigrants who find themselves at the receiving end of the locals’ misplaced anger."
8435,1,"""As Bestas"", its original title in Galician, will do with its deep plot, its extraordinary performances, its leisurely pace and its impeccable cinematography that your blood starts freezing slowly...[Full Review in Spanish}"
8436,1,A well-made and eerie thriller.
8437,1,Sorogoyen based The Beasts on a true-crime story that took place in his native Spain more than a decade ago. But it’s burnished with storytelling flourishes that energize this story of a dispute between an immigrant couple and rural locals.
8438,1,"For its second half, in the aftermath of a twist that shouldn’t be spoiled, the film takes on an unexpected depth and even a semblance of closure, though it shouldn’t be a surprise that no one fully gets what they want."
8439,1,A simmering piece of filmmaking (with a gorgeously organic soundtrack) that broods with tension and despair.
8440,1,"By juxtaposing natural majesty with human depravity, Sorogoyen’s film reminds us how quickly an idyllic dream can turn into a nightmare."
8441,1,"In balancing the two sides’ competing motives, Mr. Sorogoyen has fashioned not only a taut drama but a parable that is widely applicable across many cultures at this moment."
8442,1,"Sorogoyen constructs this destructive exercise in dick-swinging with firm, lyrical visual language"
8443,1,"“The Beasts” may not be realistic, but it is genuinely eerie."
8444,1,"A deeply uncomfortable portrait of everyday evil that’s all the more terrifying for being true — not the two main characters, who are fictional, but the conflict that comes to define their new life in that wild corner of northwest Spain."
8445,1,"Exploring dark universal themes with rich cultural specificity, this captivating thriller builds steady tension around its feuding characters."
8446,1,"Benefitting from incredibly sincere performances from the four leads, Sorogoyen doles out a dark, shattering piece of filmmaking that is as brutal as it is essential."
8447,1,"Director Rodrigo Sorogoyen carefully calibrates the tension quite effectively, letting silences build the stress between every unsaid word that leads to violent action."
8448,1,"A controlled and concise pot-boiler of stresses and strains that nobody is capable of managing, much less quelling."
8449,1,The whole thing escalates to a crescendo of seemingly unavoidable horror...
8450,1,An engrossing rural thriller...
8451,1,"A masterfully tense, suspenseful tale"
8452,1,Sorogoyen and his cast have created a compelling take on the classic idea of a feud between locals that goes into all sorts of unexpected areas.
8453,0,"The film works decently as long as it dwells in the realm of tension-building via not-so-passive aggression, but when it's all said and done, it's unclear what any of it... is supposed to mean."
8454,1,"From its very first minute, this searing drama of rural strife, xenophobia and cultural hostility is filled with almost unbearable tension..."
8455,1,"An often taut, engrossing and slow-burning psychological thriller that occasionally drags."
8456,1,The film is as much about the beastliness of outmoded machismo as it is about the perseverance and fortitude of women in opposition to it.
8457,1,"For a film rife with ugly human behavior, The Beasts is beautifully articulated."
8458,1,"More than that, it is a film we need now, containing such a sense of urgency, unlike most movies that were nominated for the Oscars recently."
8459,1,The Beasts is a sincere tale of loneliness and devastation wrapped in a gripping rural thriller pulsating with nail-biting tension.
8460,1,"Although it can be presented as a violent film, its essence goes beyond visual harshness and immerses itself into a moving love story. [Full review in Spanish]"
8461,1,A considered film about male rage and competing interests with an incredible ability to switch tones while sustaining that carefully built tension.
8462,1,"... With great skill director Rodrigo Sorogoyen, while also incorporating themes of family and gender, turns it into something far darker."
8463,1,"Between its bitter feud and sense of pastoral lawlessness, The Beasts is a timeless Western movie narrative that has been seamlessly transported to today’s northern Spain."
8464,1,"A nail-biting exercise in tension ... The Beasts is an acute examination of the parochial nature of some small communities .. a film that gets under its audience’s skin through its powerful, politically charged discussions .. a bleak, brutal perspective"
8465,1,"A terrific, gripping drama that will cross cultural borders with ease."
8466,1,"It might be a bit disappointing at a gut level, but it’s intelligent and memorable."
8467,1,"There is, inevitably, a dash of Straw Dogs and Deliverance here, but Sorogoyen deftly steers the drama clear of exploitation cinema."
8468,1,"Sorogoyen uses long, single-take scenes to capture the explosive buildup of tension; it’s a breathlessly compelling device that showcases the phenomenal quality of the acting."
8469,1,"Sorogoyen has made a brilliantly written, superbly acted film with the grave heft of non-fiction: a glimpse of stark truths behind that lush Galician landscape."
8470,1,"A riveting, merciless study of human nature, so cleverly tense throughout that even a game of dominoes becomes menacing. You didn’t know a game of dominoes could be menacing? Trust me, it can."
8471,1,the big three-cornered duel that would be the climax of a western comes here at the half-way point and allows the rest of the film to abandon masculine bluster and focus on a quieter female stoicism.
8472,1,"The Beasts is a strange film in many ways, difficult to pin down tonally or generically, but it leaves a trail of unease in the mind."
8473,1,"The Beasts is all of two hours and 17 minutes long, and yet to look away is never an option. Spanish director Rodrigo Sorogoyen reels the viewer in masterfully as he builds tension and suspense."
8474,1,Sorogoyen‘s effort combines the raw beauty of Galicia’s rural interior with its brutal lifestyle to achieve a thrilling narrative.
8475,1,"While there are shades here too of Straw Dogs in the brothers’ brazen xenophobia, as Foïs’ character Olga moves centre stage in its second half, it becomes a much more surprising interrogation of the destructive nature of the male ego."
8476,1,"In long, slow takes, Sorogoyen lets the tension build, one situation after another seeming as if it might spill over into violence."
8477,1,"Although slowly constructed and long in run-time, The Beasts never loses its intensity, making it an uncomfortable, but riveting tale of nightmare neighbours."
8478,1,As Bestas is the definitive consecration of an amazing director. [Full review in Spanish]
8479,1,A film that fractures to favor the fair and natural exploration of its central conflict. [Full review in Spanish]
8480,1,"As Bestas takes its time not to justify the actions of its villains, but to understand what led them to that point."
8481,1,Sorogoyen hits the bullseye in placing The Beasts in an intersection between a rural thriller and a Western in which all the weight of the story falls upon its characters. [Full review in Spanish]
8482,1,"A strange film in the most disturbing sense. Also, powerful. And atypical. [Full review in Spanish]"
8483,1,A Western in the key of Peckinpah's superlative (and misunderstood) Straw Dogs or Sturges' Bad Day at Black Rock. [Full review in Spanish]
8484,1,As Bestas is structured by addictive spiral tension.  [Full review in Spanish]
8485,1,As bestas turns imposing nature into the setting for a classic tragedy with the look of a 'Fordian' western.  [Full review in Spanish]
8486,1,"The perfect cocktail of drama, thriller, and rural horror. It'll give you goosebumps even without jumpscares. [Full review in Spanish]"
8487,1,"An uncomfortable but highly exciting experience...entraps you, allowing no one to escape. [Full review in Spanish]"
8488,1,Sorogoyen and Peña have an innate instinct to talk about the present and do so bravely. [Full review in Spanish]
8489,1,"A terrific psychological thriller and a brooding, muscular piece of filmmaking..."
8490,1,"Sorogoyen marks a Black Panther, a square of gladiators as sparse as a sandbox and that looks spectacular only for his opponents. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8491,1,"A terrific psychological thriller and a brooding, muscular piece of filmmaking..."
8492,1,"Sorogoyen marks a Black Panther, a square of gladiators as sparse as a sandbox and that looks spectacular only for his opponents. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8493,1,"Even if Elf might be a bit overplayed during the holiday season, Ferrell’s puppy-like enthusiasm has kept this film fresh even after all these years."
8494,1,"Elf isn’t a pre-fabricated piece of synthetic Christmas cheer like such junk as Deck the Halls, Jingle All the Way or the worst-of-the-worst Christmas With the Kranks."
8495,1,"Just not in time for the holidays, a recent revisit with the surprise Christmas classic earns a smidgen more love from our resident crusty curmudgeon."
8496,1,"Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Peter Dinklage, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, and, most surprisingly, James Caan nailing their supporting turns. Sometimes at Christmas, you just want to laugh."
8497,1,Elf stands tall with the feature being as funny today as it was in 2003.
8498,1,"“Elf” is utterly absurd and unashamedly silly and I say that as a compliment. Even if you aren’t a Will Ferrell fan, he’s an absolute blast in this fun and festive holiday treat."
8499,1,"A sugarcoated, light hearted, funny Christmas romp."
8500,1,Classic family Christmas fodder: the gorgeous candyfloss colour schemes and New York in all its resplendent wintry beauty help the film pass effortlessly by too.
8501,1,Captures the spirit that I long to have during the holiday season.
8502,1,Simplicity. Goodness. Sugar-coated. Nostalgic. Maybe a little hokey at times. Endearing. Enchanting. Go celebrate Christmas a little early with Elf -- a new Christmas classic for the 21st century.
8503,1,It's a really fun holiday film.
8504,1,There are few cinematic ventures that capture the Christmas spirit in such abundance and hit the Holiday target so directly on the nose.
8505,1,Will Ferrell's over-the-top performance in Elf is one of the reasons why the comedy has managed to stand the test of time.
8506,1,Families have discovered how funny and how well this little film tells its King-sized holiday message: the only size that counts is how big your heart is.
8507,1,"While his plotting may leave a little to be desired, Favreau directs with speed, humour and efficiency."
8508,1,"Ferrell is a hoot. So is much of this witty holiday family entertainment, which, up until the end, when the ""true spirit of Christmas"" must be reaffirmed, happily favors slapstick over treacle."
8509,1,"Raise a glass of cheer to Ferrell and Favreau. They might not have created a full-scale holiday classic here, but they've certainly given us a fresh, sparkly new bauble to hang on our perennial tree."
8510,1,"Will Ferrell has the ability to turn those wide eyes and that big body into a potent comic weapon, so Elf gets a good number of laughs from his complete, innocent abandonment to his role as a lummox-size elf."
8511,1,"It was all very simple, but enough to remind me just what a generous and talented performer Will Ferrell truly is."
8512,1,Elf is a Christmas comedy that's as sweet-natured and goofily amusing as its title character.
8513,1,required viewing during the holiday season
8514,1,"All told, Elf is undeniably cute, but not destined to become a Christmas classic. Nevertheless, children will love it."
8515,1,"Dressed in a snug green outfit throughout and dispensing decorations, sugary snacks and a beaming grin, Ferrell is the life and soul of an otherwise unexceptional Christmas celebration."
8516,0,"It would be Scrooge-like to say mean things about the innocuous Elf, so I'll just point out that director Jon Favreau's film rarely reaches its full comic potential."
8517,1,"Sure, Elf feels a little too feel-good at the end, but what do you expect? It's a Christmas movie! Anything else would be the cinematic equivalent of finding coal in your stocking."
8518,0,"The cast wrings laughs out of David Berenbaum's script as if it were a damp washcloth, but even they have trouble selling frenetic button-pushing as the Christmas spirit."
8519,1,Feels like that rare instant Christmas classic.
8520,1,A disarmingly funny holiday comedy.
8521,1,"The third act's a little clumsy, but Elf brings the Christmas cheer and loads of laughs."
8522,1,Peppy holiday favorite for both kids and parents.
8523,1,"Elf may be no more than a pleasant, amusing trifle, a grin that fades well before Thanksgiving, but it also will endure in the way that all decent Hollywood-made Christmas fairy tales last, if they're rendered with good cheer and goodwill."
8524,1,"Despite the narrative flaws, ""Elf"" is a guiltless family comedy for all audiences..."
8525,1,"A family-friendly, funny and heartwarming holiday film with a great heart that is well worth watching more than once."
8526,1,Elf might be the last modern Christmas classic we see for a long time.
8527,1,"The sentiment gets a little sticky towards the end, but many will consider this the perfect antidote to traditional Christmas fare -- especially those with a fondness for Ferrell's comedy."
8528,1,"Delivers a warm, feel-good Christmas ending that will inspire the hope that even New York City can have Christmas spirit -- at least of the Hollywood kind."
8529,1,"Most will relate to its Christmas spirit, and there's unlikely to be a dry eye in the house during the emotional climax."
8530,1,"[An] amusing, sweet-natured ode to retro-Christmas warmth and cheer..."
8531,0,The result is a turkey.
8532,0,The film soon bogs down in fake hugs and a fakier climax involving Santa (Ed Asner) and his downed sled.
8533,1,"A delightful, slapstick adventure about a nave innocent, woefully ill equipped to handle the rigors of life inside any impatiently unforgiving metropolis."
8534,1,"Ferrell's man-child invites sympathy and sniggers, making this amusing despite some flimsy plotting. Sight gags and a Santa-centred story should keep the kids happy, too."
8535,1,"Like the old TV Christmas specials it happily steals from, Elf seems poised to become a holiday classic."
8536,1,"Some humour might sail over the heads of the very young, but there's a higher chuckle rate for the grown-ups than much dread 'family' fare."
8537,1,Elf does such a great job of winning you over early on that you'll gladly endure it.
8538,1,Exudes genuine holiday cheer.
8539,1,"For those of you with a belly laugh on your wish list, Christmas has come early this year."
8540,1,This is a family picture that everyone should enjoy.
8541,1,"A charming, wholesome Christmas film with a lot of holiday spirit."
8542,1,"I love watching Ferrell do his gangly, clueless shtick, and even here, there's something inherently funny about just seeing him in a big, green elf suit. There's something inherently funny about Ferrell -- period."
8543,1,I can't believe Gnome Alone with Will Ferrell is my third favorite Christmas movie.
8544,1,"Elf is no great gift, but it's cheery enough that you probably won't ask for your money back."
8545,1,"With that simple but solid premise, Elf begins a fun ride that combines some of the basic tenets of some of the best comedies and family films of the last few years."
8546,1,
8547,0,"With a little tweaking, this could be a horror film."
8548,1,"It's just good, clean fun."
8549,1,"Ferrell is lunatic perfect, skirting the sillier sentimentality of the story, while never missing an opportunity to indulge in its darker, more ridiculous excesses."
8550,1,"Like School of Rock, Elf is an unexpected but thoroughly delightful surprise."
8551,1,Will Ferrell simply glows.
8552,1,"A hilarious holiday film in which Ferrell continues to play the same adorable, naive persona he's adopted as his shtick."
8553,1,Against every odd imaginable... emerges as the little holiday film that could.
8554,1,A sweet and sincere holiday tale about a perennial fish out of water.
8555,1,"Divertido e ingnuo, este  um filme que capta com eficincia o esprito do Natal."
8556,1,"How can you not love a guy who can say, ""An elf's four major food groups are candy canes, candy CORNS, candy, and syrup,"" with a straight face?"
8557,0,Offensive instances of product placement put the lie to the idea that 'Elf' is more interested in promoting Christmas cheer than in collecting Christmas coin...
8558,0,"Such comedy is strained, to say the least; even Ferrell's usual hilarity -- so fearless, so physical -- is constrained by this overpowering sweetness theme."
8559,1,A bright spot in the budding holiday movie season.
8560,1,"Elf will warm the heart with nostalgia, dazzle the eyes, tickle the funny bone, and make Christmas feel like it can't come fast enough."
8561,0,"A small-minded, often unfunny Christmas movie made out of spiteful consideration for audiences' money-spending powers . . . sugary, dross-covered crap."
8562,1,"Baby, it's cold outside, and we could all use a little Elf to get us through the holidays."
8563,1,"Even [Ferrell] can't save it from descending into holiday schmaltz at the end, but he fights to keep it funny."
8564,1,Part of its charm is its old-fashioned visual appeal.
8565,1,Big laughs in an Elf-sized package.
8566,1,"If you and yours see one film after your feast of pheasants make it this incredibly precious, delightfully sweet instant holiday classic Elf."
8567,1,"With Ferrell's charm, this knowing wink to the Yuletide fuzzies of yore survives the saccharine assault that claims most ""family"" films released between Nov. 1 and Christmas."
8568,1,"Supremely likeable, but it's content to be a prestigious variation of an Adam Sandler comedy rather than an inspired fantasy."
8569,1,Will Ferrell's uninhibited physical comedy ignites this fish-out-of-water family film.
8570,1,Elf has enough fun to let audiences relax and enjoy themselves.
8571,1,It's a bracingly subversive story told with tongue firmly in cheek.
8572,1,Audiences must have been VERY nice this year!
8573,1,Director Jon Favreau keeps the film sincere and adult for most of the running time.
8574,1,We had a few great laughs and the kids seemed to enjoy it.
8575,1,An early Christmas present for those who have begged Santa every year for a gift to replace Adam Sandler.
8576,1,That rarest of beasts: an extremely funny Christmas-themed family comedy with a great script and a performance of comedy gold from Will Ferrell.
8577,1,"This is a fun movie that starts off a little cutesy, but really gets funny once the 'elf out of water' concept kicks into full-gear."
8578,1,Holiday comedy gives the talented Will Ferrell a chance to flail wildly -- yet warmly -- as a human raised by elves.
8579,0,"There is one joke here, and it is particularly loud."
8580,1,...the film doles out Christmas warmth like a department store Santa handing out candy canes.
8581,1,"While sufficiently funny, charming and clever, Elf is no modern Christmas classic. But it will make Will Ferrell a bona fide star - and for good reason."
8582,1,"Thankfully, it's never preachy -- though it does get a little gooey -- simply because in defining his own ideas of cool, Favreau is way too cool to preach."
8583,1,"...innocuous, child-friendly fare with some truly enjoyable elements sprinkled into a healthy batch of Christmas mediocrity. Kinda like cinematic fruitcake."
8584,0,Elf proves that Christmas Spirit has indeed been replaced by commercialism.
8585,1,"Yes, Virginia, there is a reason to see Will Ferrell's new film. At least so long as you've got a preteen in tow."
8586,1,"The main part of the film is pretty lame, but there are some nice touches around the edges."
8587,1,the cheesiest thing I've witnessed since Lara Croft rode a shark to the surface of the Mediterranean (in a good way!)
8588,1,Berenbaum's script is as flaky as a handmade snowball but the sheer impishness of Ferrell's giddy on-screen persona seals the deal for the movie's wide-eyed off-kilter timing
8589,1,"From here on out, Elf is going to be a Christmas movie-watching tradition for me."
8590,1,"A movie that's so profoundly ridiculous that it has to be admired, if for no other reason other than its sheer willingness to run with its premise and take it to the end of the line."
8591,1,"Filled to bursting with joy, creativity, and good cheer, Elf is one early Christmas gift that does not disappoint."
8592,1,"Not only is Elf an above-average Christmas movie, but it's that rare flick that's be designed to appeal to all ages."
8593,1,The acts of kindness that [Klaus] talks about are just as important as everything else. I’ll surely make it a tradition to watch this film on Christmas Day.
8594,1,It has a splendid animation that serves as a background to rewrite the myth of Santa Claus with some nice characters that reach their most emotional point in their Christmas portrait of kindness and the value of selfless acts. [Full review in Spanish]
8595,1,"We've seen these stories a million times, but there's something about Klaus' animation that makes it very special and unique, add it to its genre-bending story and you get a precious Christmas film. [Full review in Spanish]"
8596,1,"Klaus might be one of the best and most unexpected holiday films that I have seen in years. This will satisfy the creepy and the jolly in your life with a beautiful story, strange visuals, hopeful moments, plenty of laughs and a few tears."
8597,1,"The designs of the characters and this world feel so intricate and special, and it’s incredibly easy to get lost in the artistry on display."
8598,1,"Relying on known motifs with a twist for various montages and scenes, Klaus allows the audience to be in on the joke keeping older audiences engaged while children delight in a story of one of the world’s most famous legends."
8599,1,"Klaus is a perfectly fine holiday animated movie, but it never is able to reach above that."
8600,1,It's breathtakingly animated and features a heck of a call for kindness in a world where it's in short supply.
8601,1,"Earns a spot not just as a holiday must-see, but as a landmark moment for animation."
8602,1,A great holiday tale for the whole family.
8603,1,"Helps us understand the meaning of Santa Claus in our lives, beyond the commercial and consumerist atmosphere. [Full review in Spanish]"
8604,1,An engaging re-imagining of the Santa Claus origin mythos is handled beautifully.
8605,1,"Bold and creative, Klaus should be highlighted for its artistic achievement. [Full review in Spanish]"
8606,1,"Klaus is a bundle of good-natured fun, and anyone who says otherwise deserves a piece of coal in their stocking."
8607,1,There is warmth in the wintry village and compassion amidst grudging communities.
8608,1,A heartwarming take on the Christmas origin story. You will alternate between laughing and being moved by the film.
8609,1,"Klaus has a simple message we would all do well to remember: ""A true selfless act always sparks another."""
8610,1,Klaus is the surprise of this awards season. [Full review in Spanish]
8611,1,"Beyond the approachable storytelling, fun cast, and revisionist mythology, however, lies the stunning craftsmanship of the animation itself."
8612,1,"Instead, it's a clever, not-too-sentimental Hatfields v McCoys take on the legend of Santa Claus."
8613,1,"An engaging revisionist tale, destined to become another Christmas classic."
8614,1,"While Klaus has a number of the same faults you'll find in a number of run-of-the-mill animated family movies . . . , more animated works could stand to take a cue from its visual creativity."
8615,1,"A cut above the average seasonal tale due to its impressive cast and visual inventiveness, this film is full of unexpected references which will entertain older viewers but don't get in the way of the plot."
8616,1,"The fluidity, the smoothness of the 3D animation...people, it looks good, incredible."
8617,1,This should be eligible for Best Animated Picture.
8618,1,"Destined to be added to the yearly holiday viewing rotation, Klaus is worth writing to Santa about."
8619,1,"The animation is beautiful, the story is beautiful, the music is beautiful."
8620,1,"Sure you know where the story is going, but the journey is delightful nonetheless."
8621,1,"Essentially a heartwarming tale of a millennial entrepreneur disrupting the status quo through social enterprise, Klaus is a pure pleasure to watch."
8622,1,"Its tempo is uneven, and not all characters convincing, yet Klaus relies mostly on storytelling and a back-to-basics visual style to achieve its aim rather than marketing sensibilities."
8623,1,The wonderful Rashida Jones voices a teacher who could become a love interest for Jesper. And any movie that casts Norm Macdonald as a cynical boat captain who sounds exactly like Norm MacDdnald is all right by me.
8624,1,The film version of a cup of hot chocolate after a bitterly cold day.
8625,1,"This unique take on the origins of Santa Claus examines the jolly old elf not as a literal person with magical powers, but as an idea of the spirit of giving, a fact that will likely go over many young heads but will hit adults square in the heart."
8626,1,"Klaus is enjoyable, touching and packed with good cheer. A perfect fit for all the family."
8627,1,An absolutely beautiful hand-drawn cartoon about Santa's origins.
8628,1,Klaus is destined to be a new holiday classic.
8629,1,One of the most astonishing feats of animation of the decade.
8630,1,A real novelty in terms of animation work. [Full review in Spanish]
8631,1,"It's awkward and weird, and yet all that awkwardness and weirdness give it personality and charm and a freewheeling, nonsensical quality that feels refreshing."
8632,1,Klaus manages to be a genuinely original Christmas movie.
8633,1,Klaus captures the old fashioned wonder of Christmas within the old fashioned splendor of traditional animation.
8634,1,I can't think of a better recipe for a film becoming an all-time holiday classic.
8635,1,"Though there are some narrative blips in Klaus born out of a premise that is maybe just a little too complex for a 97-minute film, the movie is absolutely beautiful."
8636,0,"None of the characters in Klaus are as delightful as they are well-drawn, and Pablos' film never earns the holiday spirit it tries to manufacture down the home stretch."
8637,1,"The use of northern landscapes provides ample opportunity to create picturesque locales. Time after time, the shots feel like concept art come to life."
8638,1,"There's plenty of comedy for the Netflix film's target audience (kids) as well, with a collection of sight gags and slapstick humour, which is offset by sarcastic quips and self-aware, darkly comedic lines of dialogue elsewhere."
8639,1,At first this film looks mean and dark but finishes with joy and spark. 'Klaus' ends up being a wonderful way to start the holiday season.
8640,1,Klaus is definitely worth watching. It's both a beautiful animated film and a touching Christmas story. The perfect combination
8641,1,"Sure to become a holiday favorite in many homes, it's warm, sweet, and fantastically funny."
8642,1,"Gorgeous to look at, clever and funny, with a sometimes dark wit that's suitable for all ages. A Christmas classic in the making."
8643,1,Cute.
8644,1,The first Spanish animated film for Netflix is a delight that embraces at all times its nature of being an old-fashioned visual proposal. [Full review in Spanish]
8645,1,"Klaus' warmth, wrapped up in classic 2D and tied together with magic and joy, makes it a perfect family holiday viewing affair that might just become a Christmas classic."
8646,1,"While Klaus may ultimately be too dark and kooky to become a heartwarming holiday classic that you revisit every year, the film is a visual gift with lots of laughs."
8647,1,"Netflix has an instant Christmas classic in 'Klaus' and I look forward to watching it during the holidays this year, the next, and for years to come."
8648,1,"One must be brave to re-write the story of an almost universal character like Santa Claus, but Klaus takes on the challenge with cunning, sympathy and humor. [Full review in Spanish]"
8649,1,"Its very construction inspires hope, that there's new life to be found in a dying method."
8650,1,Sergio Pablos' Klaus is a beautifully animated mix of old and new -- offing up a unique and quirky take on Santa's humble beginnings.
8651,1,The Christmas film of the decade.
8652,1,Klaus is a pleasant and entertaining alternative to the usual saccharine seasonal fare.
8653,1,"This animated Christmas comedy has a lot of kinetic energy to it, telling an engaging story with snappy humour and outrageously silly characters."
8654,1,The highly cartoony visual style is nicely retro and the story's ending is quite sweet.
8655,1,"It's a playful conceit: a reverse-Grinch narrative in which misanthropy gives birth to Christmas. Klaus celebrates this irony, mining laughs from scenes in which the nasty protagonists unwittingly invent beloved seasonal myths. But boy, are they nasty."
8656,1,Santa would undoubtedly give this a stamp of approval
8657,1,One of the year's best animated films for its sweet story of friendship and self-discovery and its push to revitalize 2D animation for a younger generation.
8658,1,"It's busy material, but boldly ambitious and gloriously free from Christmas clichés."
8659,0,"A lot of it really nicely designed, really nicely animated, and I really wish the story were better because I really wanted to like it and I didn't very much."
8660,1,Santa origin story is a sweet reminder of generosity.
8661,1,It's a treat to see a modern animated film that isn't afraid of absurd sight gags and bleakly funny lines of dialogue.
8662,1,"[A] serviceably sprightly mix of attitude and altruism that purports to explain how children every Christmas came to eagerly await the wrapped bounty from a kind, portly figure in a red suit."
8663,1,"Clichés inhibit ""Klaus"" from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that it's worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library"
8664,1,"Klaus is designed to break your heart just a little bit. The pain of loss and the fear of change are immensely powerful forces and Pablos doesn't shy away from addressing them, which makes Klaus the most necessary kind of Christmas movie."
8665,1,"An old-school, PG-rated animation, encompassing some digital wizardry, but generally clinging to a nostalgic, hand-drawn look, with a late-blooming Christmas theme."
8666,0,A gritty origin story probably isn't on a lot of people's wish list this holiday season.
8667,1,Sergio Pablos's film is essentially a metaphor for its own unique and refreshing mode of expression.
8668,0,"Frankly, it all seems much too complicated for what it is. And instead of making audiences love Christmas more, it raises the rather unfortunate question of why we believed it in the first place."
8669,1,"You see where this is going, but Pablos and company relish the journey - and, without pandering, they move just deliberately enough to let viewers delight in seeing how the pieces will fit together."
8670,1,"Far more successful with holiday magic than it is with character-based comedy, but that's not enough of a flaw to keep young audiences (and their parents) from potentially turning this feature into a cherished annual tradition."
8671,1,"This animated Christmas comedy has a lot of kinetic energy to it, telling an engaging story with snappy humour and outrageously silly characters."
8672,1,The highly cartoony visual style is nicely retro and the story's ending is quite sweet.
8673,1,"It's a playful conceit: a reverse-Grinch narrative in which misanthropy gives birth to Christmas. Klaus celebrates this irony, mining laughs from scenes in which the nasty protagonists unwittingly invent beloved seasonal myths. But boy, are they nasty."
8674,1,Santa would undoubtedly give this a stamp of approval
8675,1,One of the year's best animated films for its sweet story of friendship and self-discovery and its push to revitalize 2D animation for a younger generation.
8676,1,"It's busy material, but boldly ambitious and gloriously free from Christmas clichés."
8677,0,"A lot of it really nicely designed, really nicely animated, and I really wish the story were better because I really wanted to like it and I didn't very much."
8678,1,Santa origin story is a sweet reminder of generosity.
8679,1,It's a treat to see a modern animated film that isn't afraid of absurd sight gags and bleakly funny lines of dialogue.
8680,1,"[A] serviceably sprightly mix of attitude and altruism that purports to explain how children every Christmas came to eagerly await the wrapped bounty from a kind, portly figure in a red suit."
8681,1,"Clichés inhibit ""Klaus"" from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that it's worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library"
8682,1,"Klaus is designed to break your heart just a little bit. The pain of loss and the fear of change are immensely powerful forces and Pablos doesn't shy away from addressing them, which makes Klaus the most necessary kind of Christmas movie."
8683,1,"An old-school, PG-rated animation, encompassing some digital wizardry, but generally clinging to a nostalgic, hand-drawn look, with a late-blooming Christmas theme."
8684,0,A gritty origin story probably isn't on a lot of people's wish list this holiday season.
8685,1,Sergio Pablos's film is essentially a metaphor for its own unique and refreshing mode of expression.
8686,0,"Frankly, it all seems much too complicated for what it is. And instead of making audiences love Christmas more, it raises the rather unfortunate question of why we believed it in the first place."
8687,1,"You see where this is going, but Pablos and company relish the journey - and, without pandering, they move just deliberately enough to let viewers delight in seeing how the pieces will fit together."
8688,1,"Far more successful with holiday magic than it is with character-based comedy, but that's not enough of a flaw to keep young audiences (and their parents) from potentially turning this feature into a cherished annual tradition."
8689,1,"Clocking in at nearly 140 minutes, it’s no surprise that Girls to Buy definitely has some pacing issues. But Paulina Galazka’s performance works to keep our attention."
8690,1,"The title and poster may promise a trashy erotic thriller, but this movie is going for something more. This is more about the message of how easily it is to be seduced into a lifestyle."
8691,1,"Clocking in at nearly 140 minutes, it’s no surprise that Girls to Buy definitely has some pacing issues. But Paulina Galazka’s performance works to keep our attention."

8698,1,"The title and poster may promise a trashy erotic thriller, but this movie is going for something more. This is more about the message of how easily it is to be seduced into a lifestyle."
8699,1,"Simply put, this movie is way fun and worth a watch in the theaters, put it on your list of to-do's this weekend."
8700,1,"Given that seemingly every piece of media is unleashing its perception of whatever the multiverse may be, it’s refreshing that The Flash treats it as more of an existential test."
8701,1,"... fun, generous, and entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
8702,1,"The Flash may be the most underrated, most underappreciated movie of the year."
8703,0,Are multiverses just an excuse for not picking a tone or choosing a story? Our cinema’s flavor of the last few years may just be the child of channel-surfing... The Flash makes you feel simultaneously overserved and underserved.
8704,1,"The Flash creates not just an origin story but lays the foundation for an emotional and layered performance few expect from superhero movies. He can see how things could have been, allowing him to question how he became the man and hero he believes he is."
8705,0,"The result of literally decades of unsuccessful development, culminating in something that – if not borderline unwatchable – is certainly the most pronounced death throe of Warner Bros’ DC Extended Universe to date."
8706,1,Color me shocked.
8707,0,"Overall, The Flash is one of the better DCEU entries, but that’s not saying much for a universe of films often found thin or clunky. Muschietti focuses on the human side of meta-human Barry and that leads to a solid emotional journey."
8708,0,Perhaps the main problem with The Flash is there is too much of everything packed into its not short runtime. By the time we get to the final crisis of universes colliding it seems so inevitable that it’s tiring.
8709,0,"With eighty percent of The Flash devoted to other DC heroes and underwhelming visual effects, the result seems like a foregone conclusion."
8710,0,"The Flash has about two-thirds of a decent storyline, utilizing a much better characterization of the beloved superhero than we saw previously in the DC cinematic universe, but sadly the film is let down by a final act that unravels into a muddled mess."
8711,1,"Ezra Miller’s superhero outing has an affecting storyline, fan service aplenty, and an easy-way-out anticlimax; maybe this is a befitting conclusion to the DCEU storyline."
8712,1,"Ultimately, what you want to know, dear reader, is whether or not the film is worth your time? The best answer I can offer is: sorta."
8713,1,"The characters are so driven that the film’s most earth-shattering moments don’t come during an epic battle, but in quiet moments of reflection and recognition of one’s responsibility. If you can get beyond multiverse overkill, this one is worth watching."
8714,0,"It's an irregular superhero film that, with a handful of cameos and visual pyrotechnics, gets off to a fast-paced start by showing the origin of a solid Barry Allen played by Miller, but whose flashes fade at considerable speed. [Full review in Spanish]"
8715,1,"Setting aside the actor’s numerous legal issues, Miller turns in a masterful pair of performances."
8716,0,Director Andy Muschietti does little to make the front half of the film interesting other than to try to explain the always complicated rules of time travel.
8717,1,The thing that sticks with you about The Flash is that crazy baby shower.
8718,1,"The Flash is a highly entertaining film that strikes a balance between emotional depth and nostalgia. While there are moments of uneven CGI and pacing, the movie shines as one of the most well-written and genuinely satisfying DCEU entries in a long time."
8719,1,"The interesting, profound parallels between Barry Allen's arcs, the emotional moral dilemmas about life's scars, and the return of Danny Elfman's iconic Batman theme are some of the aspects that make this blockbuster a very satisfying, nostalgic viewing."
8720,0,"The issues in ""The Flash"" come down to the fact that anyone under a certain age might not understand or care about all of the '90s sentimentality at the center of the story. Surprises abound, some in poor taste."
8721,1,"Fortunately, ""The Flash"" comes with enough twists and tricks to keep things from being stale. And a large part of that is seeing Michael Keaton suit up as Batman again for the first time in more than 30 years."
8722,1,"The fact that The Flash exists as a film is itself something of a miracle (albeit one driven purely by economics), but the fact that it's also actually really damn good...Well, just who on earth saw that coming?"
8723,0,"Feeling like disparate pieces that don't stitch together to make the best whole isn't what The Flash was aiming for, but it's what's been zapped into cinemas."
8724,1,The Flash isn’t exactly a bad film but many fans will expect a lot more from it. There is enough in the film to suggest that the next films in the DC universe could be something special.
8725,1,"It’s extremely entertaining, surprisingly funny but more importantly, it has a great emotional story with a lot of heart. Now I’m not crowning it the greatest CBM ever but it’s definitely a MUST SEE!"
8726,1,"For a film that references Back to the Future throughout, it sure didn't follow the same formula, but it's still fun enough to see in theatres."
8727,1,"Defying all odds THE FLASH is incredible. Purely special in so many ways.  Incredible performances, incredible action scenes, an incredibly emotional tale that at the center of its story is Barry Allen. This is a what if Tim Burton Directed A Flash film"
8728,0,"""The Flash” offers some general interest to fans of the swift, fleet-of-foot character, but ultimately, the movie is a meandering, multi-layered CGI-laden drama that offers little that’s new."
8729,1,"A buddy movie packed with action and time-traveling that turns out to be much more insightful and exhilarating than one could have expected. Unfortunately, the duality of the two Barry Allen protagonists ends up becoming a metaphor for its inconsistency."
8730,0,"The Flash may be fast, but he’s still a step behind the cinematic competition. There’s some diverting entertainment to be had here, but just as many opportunities to be baffled or annoyed."
8731,0,"Going back in time and revisiting nearly every previous era of DC in order to tell a story about the importance of letting go, The Flash is just running in place."
8732,0,"The Flash isn't totally devoid of pathos, and Keaton provides a ton of nostalgia-heavy fun. But its odd aesthetic choices and circular storytelling resulted in a final product that's more of an exhausting marathon than breezy jog."
8733,0,"Keaton's easily the best part of a flawed movie, one that leans hard on viewer nostalgia instead of a screenplay that holds together."
8734,1,"Michael Keaton does stand out as an aging Batman, called to fight yet another time. Keaton’s eyebrows were always expressive."
8735,1,"The Flash is not without flaws – but those are inherent in many films within the genre, like the over-stuffed CG filled finale. However, for the most part The Flash is an excellent superhero adventure that has plenty to offer its audience."
8736,0,A watered down slap stick version The Flashpoint Paradox storyline.
8737,0,"After the dimension-hopping possibilities explored in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” the options of the multiverse shown here — even in the grand finale, which resurrects three deceased actors through CGI — feel pedestrian."
8738,1,"When the film comes to its point, it tries too hard to impress its multi-verse view. What we leave with is this: If producers don’t like an actor in a role, they’ve got the ability to recast. No one, apparently, is safe."
8739,1,"Ezra Miller’s performance is fantastic, and I also enjoyed seeing Michael Keaton’s performance as Batman; there are surprise cameos by other Marvel superheroes as well."
8740,0,"Sadly, the studio did this movie no favors by releasing it hot on the heels of the excellent Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse, which follows similar themes in a superior superhero saga. The Flash may be fast, but it feels late to the party."
8741,1,"“The Flash” is centered in the sweet spot between action, comedy, and heart because is is grounded in a deep affection for the source material but is not afraid to play with some of its absurdities."
8742,1,"My inner comic book geek beamed, while still mindful of the film's place in the bigger picture, both for the future of its lead actor's career and the future of movies based on DC Comics."
8743,0,"Just as Darwinian evolution tends toward crabs, big-budget Hollywood films tend toward Batman. There’s even a name for this type of convergent evolution: Batmanization."
8744,1,The Flash feels like a comic book come alive.
8745,1,"It is a complicated story, but it makes sense within its own space. I hope that Ezra Miller continues to play The Flash. He is a fine actor. If you don't think so, just check out his performance in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' sometime."
8746,0,Blame the ancient Greeks for inventing the general idea of the multiverse. Blame DC for propagating the concept in one of its Flash comics in 1961. And blame anyone you like for this hot mess of a film.
8747,0,"It's funny here and there... But overall, it's kind of a mess."
8748,1,"Forever threatening to consume itself literally as well as philosophically, The Flash is redeemed by its edgy humour, Ezra Miller’s investment, and Muschietti’s adept staging of the numerous action scenes."
8749,0,"Warner’s $220 million, CGI-filled bomb is what happens when superhero movies peddle in nostalgia for a history that doesn’t exist."
8750,0,"The whole experience perpetually comes across like a first draft that nobody cared to revise, exuding the same sloppy mediocrity that’s defined the canon-level disgrace known as the DCEU."
8751,0,"The moments of blatant fan service will undoubtedly make nerds happy, but the story doesn’t stand up to scrutiny, and frankly, that fan service is an empty gesture because the multiverse presented here is totally unimaginative."
8752,0,"The Flash is not the worst of its kind, although it definitely is one of the most vacuous expeditions into the multiverse."
8753,1,"Keaton's appearance is also nostalgic, of course, and there are a host of Easter eggs and cameos that will make audiences either applaud, laugh, or roll their eyes, depending on how they feel about the sentimentality of the sequence."
8754,1,This movie is absolutely insane. It has horrible CGI at times but huge creativity at others. The cast works really well and the storyline actually works well in the multiverse. I enjoyed this hot mess way more than I thought I would.
8755,1,"The Flash is far from being that disastrous movie most seem to derive solely based on box office numbers. As a Superhero Movie is for sure within standard, nitpicking aside. Genre fatigue + multiverse movies saturation might be the actual cultprits here."
8756,0,"And it has a heart—sometimes it's in tachycardia and in danger of sputtering out, but it's there."
8757,0,"The Flash is the type of film that is at best a grave example of “superhero fatigue” and at worst, a harsh reminder of the greatness we could have received."
8758,1,"The first superhero with chest hair. Miller is terrific. The film is fun and good. What happened to Christian Bale, Val Kilmer and shamefully, why ignore the 21ST Century’s Superman, Henry Cavill?"
8759,0,...increasingly underwhelming...
8760,0,"Andy Muschietti's jittery, frenetic The Flash has about it the feeling of someone getting away with something."
8761,0,This overstuffed helping of DC Comics chaos has trouble sustaining engagement beyond maybe the first hour and a half of its two-hour and 24-minute run time.
8762,1,Steady action pairs exceedingly well with the humor and world-building of Hodson's script.
8763,0,"In drama & in life, “anything is possible” does the opposite of making things compelling and beautiful; it makes things boring. As Michael Keaton’s Bruce Wayne describes it in The Flash (with an amusing spaghetti metaphor), the multiverse is a “hot mess.”"
8764,1,"This DC movie felt like a franchise upgrade. The story was interesting and didn’t feel like DC was trying too hard to be like Marvel (although the multi-verse timing is a bit too close to its rival). For once, DC has a story that could just be DC."
8765,1,"The Flash is an entertaining enough film that will please most crowds, with good performances from Miller, Keaton and Calle."
8766,1,The film is enormously entertaining.
8767,0,"This is the way the DC Extended Universe ends: not with a bang, but with grating comedy, momentumless action, and convictions so flimsy that they cancel themselves out."
8768,1,The film works really well... it's powerful.
8769,1,"The Flash is great fun, mostly well-made, and thoroughly enjoyable."
8770,1,"The Flash is a spectacular blockbuster that wipes the slate clean for an exciting future. Not everything in the DC Universe worked, but at least it can go out with a bang."
8771,1,"We've already seen this premise four or five times, but this is oddly one of the better versions of it, thanks to action scenes that feel like more than placeholders."
8772,0,"Neither a cinematographic nor a communal experience, The Flash is a visual list of fleeting, disposable moments... [Full review in Spanish]"
8773,0,"The special effects aren't particularly flashy, and Flash's races are singularly clumsy. [Full review in Spanish]"
8774,0,"A dull, overly-saturated CGI action movie mess, that’s both half an hour too long (as per usual!) and rushed."
8775,0,"There was some optimism that this film could stick the landing and pass the torch to James Gun and company. Sadly though, that wasn’t really the case."
8776,0,"As a Justice League member, the Flash, as portrayed by Ezra Miller, was an entertaining character who excelled in scene-stealing moments and provided comic relief. However, as the main character his obnoxiousness is overwhelming."
8777,1,The Flash is far from perfect but it will do while we wait for Indiana Jones’s return.
8778,1,The Flash strikes an impressive balance of the zany Allen antics the character is known for with the crushing inevitability of the plot.
8779,0,"When The Flash isn’t consumed by lengthy aerial battles and whirling roundabouts of effects, tossing out names and faces of nearly everyone who has worn a hero cape, the movie’s hero embarks on a real journey, falling short in the final steps."
8780,1,"While everything swells to the expected hyper-cartoonish climax, director Andy Muschietti and writer Christina Hodson impressively keep the story centred on the people, leaving the apocalyptic elements as merely plot points, as they should be."
8781,1,"Its action, while ugly, is appropriately kinetic and fabulously inventive."
8782,0,"... An avalanche of wax figures that captures the worst of cameo culture, digital necrophilia and nostalgia manipulation. [Full review in Spanish]"
8783,1,"At its best it speeds along with its own style and a strong ensemble. Most importantly, it's genuinely fun."
8784,1,"Director Andy Muschietti and Hodson and lead actor Miller all do well with what’s most important, which is character."
8785,1,It all moves along rather zippily until director Andy Muschietti tries to restage the 2013 film's CGI-heavy finale.
8786,1,A humorous and heartfelt examination of loss and acceptance with strong lead performances and fun action — a celebration of DC’s cinematic history.
8787,1,"The Flash is really well constructed, including giving viewers the character’s origin without being an origin story. It's more of a lighthearted, comedy-heavy movie that still makes the emotional moments land."
8788,1,"The Flash is certainly fun, packed with some great action and surprising emotion, it's just erratic in its consistency…and those visuals…damn."
8789,0,"It's not a total mess, but this mashup of ideas lacks tight and quality execution, resulting in a few highlights and a lot of missed opportunities that might have made this a story worth telling."
8790,1,It's freaking bananas that we get to see Michael Keaton as Batman again.
8791,0,"This is the worst film I have seen in 2023. I genuinely despise it. Don’t waste your time or your money. If you’d like to see Keaton and Calle’s good work amidst the dreck, wait until it comes to the library."
8792,0,"When it works, the film moves like a bullet. When it stumbles? Like the greatest characters in comics, and like life, the one enemy The Flash can’t outrun is itself."
8793,1,"I appreciated its self-referential style, the well-timed laughs, the good pacing, the open-armed embrace of nostalgia, and the way it left a big smile on my face."
8794,0,"Call me old-fashioned but I liked the steroidal-ly jacked, testosterone-fueled, early comic book superheros the way I like a '69 Camaro with a powerfully configured V-8 engine. So I'm not a fan of the new, skinny Spider-Men, nor of this new skinny Flash."
8795,0,"There are authentic, interesting, and original comic book movies that deserve respect -- 'The Flash' just isn't one of them."
8796,0,"Most disappointingly, Keaton's Batman hasn’t been written as the kinky weirdo from the Burton movies. He’s just another retro nostalgia prop in a film overwhelmed by references and inside jokes."
8797,1,"It’s efficient, pacy and largely enjoyable stuff."
8798,1,"'The Flash' is bright and fleet-footed, continuing DC's welcome departure from the leaden, sluggish, grayness of the early entries."
8799,1,Director and co-writer Kurtis David Harder (“Summerland”) creates a lush and gorgeous film that will make his audience want to jump into the screen and join the characters regardless of the looming danger.
8800,1,A captivating central performance does its best to elevate this otherwise serviceable social media horror.
8801,1,"A smart, savvy thriller anchored by star Cassandra Naud's magnetic performance. The way the film uses her natural birthmark is particularly innovative, as are the multiple shifts in perspective that help to keep the story fresh."
8802,1,"There’s a lot to love about Influencer, however that just makes its flaws all the more frustrating."
8803,1,A horrific reality check for those lost in the monetised sauce of the internet’s digital fakery.
8804,0,"Where’s she from? What’s that giant chip on her shoulder? Harder and Tesh Guttikonda’s script can’t be bothered—beyond giving her a large facial birthmark that presumably “explains” why she hates all these globetrotting, selfie-taking pretty people."
8805,1,It zigged everytime I thought it would zag.
8806,1,"Influencer is a meticulously crafted, gripping mystery sure to keep audiences guessing."
8807,1,"Influencer is a nice mix of psychological thrillers like Single White Female and Hand That Rocks the Cradle, with a modern social media spin. Cassandra Naud delivers a compelling performance, despite wanting a little more from the character."
8808,1,"[It's] a tense, fun little thriller that takes some unexpected turns."
8809,1,"More than anything, Influencer is just fun, primarily for the strong performances but also for the beautiful locations and general disdain for influencers of all kinds. They may not deserve to die, but they still suck."
8810,1,"Just when you think you know where Influencer is going, it pulls a switcheroo, playing into tropes (yes, there is a ""no cell service"" moment) while also setting you on edge..."
8811,1,What awaits you is a mystery in a beautiful landscape sprinkled with some intense kills and anxiety-inducing scenarios.
8812,1,"Influencer isn’t likely to make anyone want to become a vlogger or go on an exotic vacation, but it holds our attention and keeps us guessing throughout."
8813,1,"Influencer has very good acting in each of the roles, even if most of the characters lack a certain depth that would make the story and conflicts that much better."
8814,1,Influencer is a compelling drama with real-world horror that keeps you hooked.
8815,1,"Thriller flirts with boredom before ramping up for a taught, and shocking finale."
8816,0,"Predictability is most unfortunate about Influencer, as the film attempts to live up to its thriller status but ends up spoon-feeding the audience and telegraphing every “twist.”"
8817,1,"Set around social media, Influencer serves as a fun thriller. While it has little new to say about its core subject, it expertly homages iconic works."
8818,0,"A strong, noteworthy turn by Cassandra Naud is not enough to distract from what feels more like a rug-pulling exercise than a real tale of suspense or commentary on isolation or the central occupation of the title."
8819,1,"From here Influencer delivers a rock solid Hitchcockian thriller against the picturesque backdrop of Thailand that toys with expectations up until its final moments. Like Psycho, it’s hard to know what’s coming after the film’s opening credits."
8820,1,"If you want to see a really tightly constructed thriller with some really cool curveballs in it, this is excellent stuff."
8821,1,"With sharp dialogue, skillful plotting and simmering dread, Influencer is plenty worthy of that “Like” button."
8822,1,Full-blooded when it needs to be... but its focus is on mutable storytelling and its atmosphere of nebulous menace
8823,1,"Eerie and disturbing, this cautionary tale of self awareness has some solid thrills."
8824,1,"Influencer perfectly captures a moment in time. Ten years from this date, we’ll be vastly unsettled by something else; Kurtis David Harder’s film captures terrors which are only possible, like this, right now."
8825,1,"[Influencer] is smartly crafted, well-written, and strongly performed."
8826,1,"On a surface level, this is an alluring film, all about what happens when people bring their carefully constructed online personas into the messier, bloodier real world."
8827,1,"If you can just go with the flow, “Influencer” may not convince you that’s an occupation with a future, but it will still have you on the edge of your seat to the very end."
8828,1,"Though it doesn't fully stick the landing, losing sight of its most compelling character along the way, its authentically creepy contortions makes it entertaining as hell to see it fly."
8829,1,"The result is a well-executed thriller wherein we’re allowed to check our compassion at the door. There's no one to therefore root for, so we bask in the potential carnage to see who (if anyone) escapes alive."
8830,1,"Director and co-writer Kurtis David Harder relies on that influence to toy with the audience, too, in a thrilling and clever way that makes Influencer fascinating to watch."
8831,1,"Beyond the plotting and scheming, Harder also plays a neat game with sympathy in this story."
8832,1,"Influencer's messages land with a softer impact, but that doesn’t prevent its twisty predatory narrative from snagging our attention like a buzzworthy viral sensation."
8833,1,[Influencer] constantly subverts expectations with a plot that darts in unforeseen directions.
8834,1,"Harder has made good and entertaining use of a premise that could have become a simple gimmick, and Naud and Saper prove strong leads as their characters try to read each other between the likes."
8835,1,[A] smartly arranged thriller...
8836,1,Influencer confounded me countless times and it sticks landing oh so well. It also has something potent to say about social media.
8837,1,"Offers a chilling look at our natural insecurities, arrogance, and conceit when it comes to our online presence, but it also is a really fun horror-thriller that’s exceptionally satisfying."
8838,1,"""Influencer"" is a tight, tense, contemporary thriller that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but still delivers a solid entry into the genre."
8839,1,"A suspenseful, and absolutely stellar dark thriller..."
8840,1,"Naud does a fantastic job with the material she is provided and is the best part of Influencer. From her sinister stares to her subtly manipulative manner, she controls the scene every time she is on screen."
8841,1,"It slightly wobbles in the second act and some of the characters feel a tad shallow, but the finale is more than satisfying."
8842,1,Probes the disparity between online facades and authentic living while masterfully unravelling exciting twists through brilliant performances that enrich the narrative.
8843,1,"Influencer is able to cut through competition by delivering compelling visuals, tantalising arcs and villainous commentary. A thrilling ride in what makes us human, perfect and unhinged."
8844,1,This is a brutal and incisive look at social media addiction but the scariest thing about Influencer might just be how it reflects our own online obsession back at us.
8845,0,Influencer feels like there was a good idea somewhere that got rushed along the way. I don’t know what the original idea was but this movie is as shallow as it paints its characters to be.
8846,1,"Cassandra Naud gives a hypnotic performance and, combined with the rest of the cast and unexpected turns, makes Influencer an entertaining cautionary tale."
8847,1,"A zippy sun-soaked thriller that rewards the viewer with its spellbinding blend of glitz, glamour, and mystery."
8848,1,Influencer becomes this canny and morally slippery exploration of what objectification means and how it functions in our culture.
8849,1,"Kurtis David Harder’s taut Thailand-set thriller follows the anxiety, emptiness and increasing isolation of online celebrity"
8850,1,"A suspenseful, and absolutely stellar dark thriller..."
8851,1,"Naud does a fantastic job with the material she is provided and is the best part of Influencer. From her sinister stares to her subtly manipulative manner, she controls the scene every time she is on screen."

8860,1,"Kurtis David Harder’s taut Thailand-set thriller follows the anxiety, emptiness and increasing isolation of online celebrity"
8861,1,"A suspenseful, and absolutely stellar dark thriller..."
8862,1,"Naud does a fantastic job with the material she is provided and is the best part of Influencer. From her sinister stares to her subtly manipulative manner, she controls the scene every time she is on screen."
8863,1,"It slightly wobbles in the second act and some of the characters feel a tad shallow, but the finale is more than satisfying."
8864,1,Probes the disparity between online facades and authentic living while masterfully unravelling exciting twists through brilliant performances that enrich the narrative.
8865,1,"Influencer is able to cut through competition by delivering compelling visuals, tantalising arcs and villainous commentary. A thrilling ride in what makes us human, perfect and unhinged."
8866,1,This is a brutal and incisive look at social media addiction but the scariest thing about Influencer might just be how it reflects our own online obsession back at us.
8867,0,Influencer feels like there was a good idea somewhere that got rushed along the way. I don’t know what the original idea was but this movie is as shallow as it paints its characters to be.
8868,1,"Cassandra Naud gives a hypnotic performance and, combined with the rest of the cast and unexpected turns, makes Influencer an entertaining cautionary tale."
8869,1,"A zippy sun-soaked thriller that rewards the viewer with its spellbinding blend of glitz, glamour, and mystery."

8872,0,"Adults and all but the most polite kids will be squirming in their seats, wishing some cute dogs could rescue them from boredom."
8873,0,"Like it's predecessor, this is a great big commercial disguised as a  not very good animated feature."
8874,1,"It may not have much soul, but it combines the usual Paw Patrol sentiments with flashy, well-staged action scenes."
8875,0,"Parents should approach with caution, or at the very least, with extremely strong coffee."
8876,1,"Kids will be there on the double to lap it up, and adults will find it tolerable, which is about as much as you can hope for."
8877,0,"[A] derivative sub-Marvel tedium about super-fast, super-strong and super-annoying canines who never feel remotely A-list. They’re not, alas, ready for their close-ups."
8878,1,"PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie is top-notch in cuteness, fun, animation, and production."
8879,0,A snore.
8880,1,Provides entertainment to the audience for which it was intended.
8881,1,"The themes here are easy to follow and surprisingly sweet, even from an oversimplified property like Paw Patrol ... The Mighty Movie will have everyone rooting for the underdog."
8882,1,"Did I have a good time with this film as much as I did with the first? Honestly, no. But this is not a movie that’s created for people like me in mind...So, the real question is, will THEY [the children] enjoy this movie? In that regard, I think yes."
8883,0,"“PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie” is not a good movie, but it should appeal to its intended audience."
8884,1,'Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie' is a real treat.
8885,0,"Rehashed plot and all, Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie gives young children a fair indication of what to expect once they’re ready for modern superhero movies aimed at an older crowd."
8886,1,For a kids film there is still a genuine charm and comedy that will make the film enjoyable for both kids and adults.
8887,1,"Skye's subplot will particularly resonate with young audiences, since she initially feels like her small size makes her the team's weakest link."
8888,1,"The movie is relentlessly adorable, with big surges in sappy emotion as well as a few intense action beats. Fortunately, nothing lasts too long, as the filmmakers play to short attention spans."
8889,1,"The new film from Paramount and Nickelodeon will appeal to both children and adults, thanks to its humor, action sequences, and a touching origin story. [Full review in Spanish]"
8890,1,"The film offers some cute character interactions, a funny villain & a story that is enough to have you rooting for the heroes, and Skye in particular."
8891,1,"While “PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie” will still play well with kids on the small screen, there’s enough big-screen action and loads of heart to help kids engage with their favorite pups on a whole new level."
8892,1,"Don't babies deserve superhero movies, too?"
8893,1,"PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie is blatant commercialism. If you're going to sell toys, this movie at least puts some work into making it fun."
8894,0,"Nothing about the sequel is anywhere near as compelling, surprising, or even as mildly interesting as the pups’ first movie, which, let’s be honest, already wasn’t Citizen Kane."
8895,0,"This is still a time-waster designed to momentarily distract the smallest children in exchange for pitching them a new line of PAW Patrol action figures. Little kids will like it, but they can still do better."
8896,1,"Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie is a cute, surprisingly satisfying animated feature. As an entertaining family film, it accomplishes its goal, and it provides a strong message around a story that kids should enjoy."
8897,1,"Not torture for adults. PAW patrollers receive superpowers, of course."
8898,1,"Is it a worthwhile transition object to get children used to the thrill of seeing stories they love on a giant screen in a dark room? Of course, it is."
8899,1,"As with the first feature, The Mighty Movie is not an experience to seek out if you don't have a five-year-old who requires it, but it's not disagreeable to sit through if you do get stuck at it."
8900,1,Skye’s story is sweet enough to make it worth recommending especially for families of small children.
8901,0,"The Paw Patrol gives youngsters a super-hero movie much less mighty than the subtitle suggests...the super-hero business gets tiresome, especially in the multiple crises of the last act."
8902,1,One of the few jokes for grown-ups in the movie reveals the self-aware spirit of the movie: A news reporter announces that the super dogs are not millionaire Hollywood actors pretending to have special powers. [Full review in Spanish]
8903,1,"PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie has enjoyable moments children and adults will enjoy, but also poses big questions and complicated ideas about personal growth and achievement."
8904,1,The animation design is attractive and clearly superior to the cable series. [Full review in Spanish]
8905,1,"PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie maintains what made the TV show so appealing for kids, but also has enough gags aimed at parents to round out the experience for the whole family."
8906,1,"If you can imagine your kiddo enjoying an animated car-chase scene featuring puppies and kittens, set to Icona Pop’s “I Love It,” they’ll probably be thrilled with “The Mighty Movie.”"
8907,1,Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie is nicely animated and reminds kids to celebrate their qualities and power from within. It won’t win awards but it is certain to delight its target audience.
8908,0,"Unfortunately, much of the film’s running time is taken up [with]... the sort of typically mind-numbing action sequences stuffing adult live-action superhero franchises."
8909,1,"In a world overloaded with superhero films, PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie is an adequate option for anyone who will watch entertainment geared to kids under the age of 10. Like many sequels, it tries to do more than the original, but it's not cluttered."
8910,1,"A slightly more explosive take on family entertainment, with action sequences once again capturing attention while the script for this follow-up is a little less thrilling."
8911,1,"Although Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie does not bring anything new to theaters and presents a fairly hackneyed plot, it gives us a very beautiful story with quite emotional overtones... [Full review in Spanish]"
8912,0,"It is worth appreciating that PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie has an emotional core, but with a few obvious tweaks here and there, the story could have actually taught children an important, useful lesson"
8913,1,"It's noisy, colourful, chirpy, good-natured and the good guys will always win in the end. The storytelling is efficient, if a bit lazy - and the voices behind the animation... are reliably hyperbolic."
8914,1,"A triumph! An exhilarating, captivating and inspirational adventure for the whole family with just the right balance of action, comedy and heart."
8915,1,"Thankfully, the adult-oriented jokes sprinkled throughout – chiefly about movie merchandise and overpaid Hollywood actors – help brighten an enjoyable, fast-moving adventure full of colourful action and big dollops of unavoidable wide-eyed cuteness."
8916,1,"While not as subversive as its predecessor, it delivers on the promise of a smart and salient sequel with bolder action, bigger stakes, and deeper resonance for all ages."
8917,1,"Absolutely adorable & something young fans will flip over. While all the pups make an appearance, this is Skye’s story, and what an emotional one it is."

8929,1,"Absolutely adorable & something young fans will flip over. While all the pups make an appearance, this is Skye’s story, and what an emotional one it is."
8930,1,The Grinch will always be a great holiday classic. This rendition is perfect for today’s political climate and is very much a product of 2018.
8931,1,"Its a fun, harmless venture back to Whoville and serves as a solid seasonal bridge for those already ready to deck the halls."
8932,0,Its lack of new ideas or interesting executions of old ones turn it into a remarkably generic experience.
8933,0,"When you are working with source material as tight as How the Grinch Stole Christmas! - a lean, mean 26 minutes, after all - anything added is pure fat."
8934,0,"It's moderately amusing, but it has a difficult time justifying its own existence."
8935,1,Quite rad.
8936,1,A feast of festive fun will appeal to both kids and adults alike. Lots of Christmas joy with a reminder that love and kindness is not just for Christmas.
8937,0,"[W]hile this take on the story isn't particularly cynical or crass as one may expect, it's also pointless at its core when placed into any other context."
8938,1,The purpose of the 2018 iteration of The Grinch is to bring the story to children who haven't gotten a chance to see the original. There's enough charm and freshness to keep it's spirit alive.
8939,1,"The 3D animation is a pleasure to behold, while Pharrell's rhyming narration gives a hint of the old"
8940,1,"It's not a work of genius, but it is one of the best things Illumination has been a part of in its filmmaking history. Let's face it, it's tough to mess up a classic."
8941,1,A festive treat that is a sort-of delight.
8942,0,"The Grinch is a good Christmas movie, I guess. It covers all the bases and has a good message but it fails to be as good as other versions because it chooses to do too much."
8943,1,This adaptation...finds a way to tell the story anew and seeks to provide more depth to the titular Grinch while also expanding Cindy Lou Who's role in the story.
8944,1,"As this is the season for family moviegoing, The Grinch throws its hat in the ring as a solid offering to spend one's hard earned money on."
8945,1,A full-hearted assault on cynicism - this is a wonderful Christmas film with personality and charm enough to light up the hearts of a thousand Grinches.
8946,1,"A fun family film that is beautifully animated. While not as enjoyable as the tighter-paced classic, the updated graphics can be appreciated."
8947,0,"The Grinch takes a classic short story, adds some pointless plot digressions and then seems to completely miss the point by the end."
8948,1,"A fun new take on a classic tale, The Grinch exceeded expectations. It isn't perfect, but it is a fun holiday movie for the whole family to enjoy."
8949,1,"The Grinch will leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling that you just can't shake."
8950,1,We expand more on the Grinch's backstory...Cumberbatch with an American accent is a completely transformative performance.
8951,1,...the Grinch still starts out with a heart two sizes too small and is transformed by the healing presence of a child. That's a message we can all get behind.
8952,1,A paradox that only ends up filling with charisma an ideal Christmas adventure to start the holidays. [Full Review in Spanish]
8953,1,"Despite its familiarity, the new version is effective and heartwarming, particularly as it emphasizes the concept of empathy."
8954,0,"The Grinch is bright and colorful, but the narrative feels a bit off from the anti-consumerist message that Dr. Seuss may have originally intended."
8955,1,I mean who doesn't love a grouch getting a lesson in kindness and forgiveness from the adorably scrumptious Cindy Lou Who? This incarnation of The Grinch is straight up dedicated to kindness and love...the things we need most.
8956,0,"The film's positive messages about inclusivity and diversity are welcomed, but the film is lacking."
8957,1,"Fortunately for Cheney and Mosier, the film is charming enough that young kids will eat it up."
8958,1,Ramps up the slapstick while adding a needless backstory that threatens to undercut the text's message
8959,0,"It's cute and fluffy, but it's not remarkable in its telling of the classic Seuss story, no matter how many variations it throws in."
8960,1,"A fresh update from the 1966 cartoon film; its bright, colorful set designs, dry humor, and messages of love and kindness are perfect for the holidays."
8961,1,[It's] a story aimed at the very young ... but The Grinch is still a nicely wrought movie that should be a nap-free experience for accompanying parents.
8962,0,"He's not a mean one, this Mr. Grinch. And that's largely what cripples the latest and lamest adaptation of Dr. Seuss' classic children's book."
8963,1,This new version of The Grinch meets to entertain and enlighten new generations of viewers about the history of that character and promote their message of union and solidarity. [Full Review in Spanish]
8964,1,The Grinch should help get kids in the Christmas spirit (not that some of them need it) in the lead up to the big day.
8965,1,... odds are you've already read the book or watched the original. And knowing that The Grinch doesn't ruin Christmas won't stop anyone from enjoying this delightful film.
8966,0,"The result is a meandering, low-stakes affair, punctuated by fine but forgettable visual jokes."
8967,0,[It] feels about 75 minutes too long.
8968,0,"The whole deal with the Grinch is he is supposed to be, if you'll forgive me, a seemingly irredeemable bastard. He literally lacks the capacity for any kind of love. If he's just kind of a crabby neighbor everything is less impressive in juxtaposition."
8969,1,"(Nowhere) near perfect, but ... an undeniably fun film to take the family to as Christmas approaches and to remind all that love and kindness can change things for the better."
8970,0,"Colourful and amusing enough, and yet, like so many Christmas movies, it's all a bit forgettable - and iffy...Bah, humbug."
8971,1,"The Grinch isn't a bad movie, but neither is it a necessary one. And that's OK - he might not be the Grinch we deserve, but he's the one we need right now."
8972,0,"The colors hypnotize and the textures surprise, but something seems to have been lost in the translation. Something about the character and touch Seuss. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8973,0,"Whilst The Grinch may not entirely capture the festive feels, the kids should certainly get a pre-Christmas kick out of it."
8974,1,"This serving from Illumination (the Despicable Me people) is a handsome, by-the-numbers kids film."
8975,1,The animation is top-notch and unlikely to cause half as many nightmares as Carrey and company's grotesque prosthetics.
8976,1,"For viewers of a reduced age, The Grinch will soon be all the rage. For those known to be somewhat older, the reception will be slightly colder."
8977,1,There are occurrences that the little ones will enjoy more than the pre-adolescents or the occasional adult companions. [Full review in Spanish]
8978,0,"The Grinch took out too much, without adding much of anything. It wasn't Seussian enough and didn't add enough of an original plot to hold adult interest. Its humor also fell flat."
8979,1,"The Grinch installs himself with an immense palette of vivacious colors, ingenuity and a bet on visual comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
8980,1,"[The Grinch] is excessively well-meaning and very tame. No doubt it will please those who will always love the story, no matter what shape it takes, but you have to be a fan."
8981,0,This newest Grinch lacks plenty of magic between some lazy animation and not taking any risks. [Full review in Spanish]
8982,1,"It's the same. The Grinch, other than the expanded story and the upgraded effects, is exactly the same and leaves you with the same warm feelings for the holidays."
8983,1,Cumberbatch... does not let us down.
8984,1,Humor and physical comedy present mask the frivolous and even triteness of the central objective of the Grinch. [Full Review in Spanish]
8985,0,"No, really, that's [it] now: 'What if instead of an absurdly short-tempered psychotic hermit who snaps, the Grinch is a mildly depressed neurotic who doesn't manage seasonal affective disorder very well and eventually escalates for no good reason?'"
8986,1,"Little ones will love it, but kids over eight and accompanying adults may be less forgiving of a short story stretched to snapping point for the big screen."
8987,1,"The pacing could have been tighter, but overall, it is a fun family film."
8988,0,"It's a beautiful-looking movie. Young kids will like it, but I was kind of bored with it."
8989,0,"If you've seen the original, don't bother with this remake."
8990,0,"It's best for kids and adults who just can't handle the angry, diabolical monster of films past."
8991,0,"The one thing a Seuss film should - must! - do is to provide a memorably weird world, and this simply doesn't do that."
8992,1,"The latest animated iteration of Christmas' most famous nemesis might not be strictly necessary, but it's still pretty fun - and revamped just enough to feel fresh."
8993,1,http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=26227&s=Reviews
8994,0,The concoction of overpaid simpletons who have opted for a more literal subtext and undermined the very spirit of the source in the process.
8995,1,"This Grinch's brevity and bright, bold colors may be just the kind of thing to relax and get lost in this holiday season."
8996,1,"For all that makes The Grinch redundant, there's enough that still warms the heart."
8997,1,Was The Grinch necessary? Absolutely not. But Illumination executed it better than I thought.
8998,1,"The smoothly animated result isn't as dreadful as the Jim Carrey live-action version, but it's almost as wrong-headed."
8999,1,"The film feels very much aimed at a very young audience and it will delight that demographic, but older viewers may be less solidly drawn in."
9000,1,"Older viewers may not appreciate the film as much as younger viewers, but The Grinch is not too cutesy and it has just the right amount of Christmas charm to go along with and enjoy its festive fun."
9001,1,"It works, as a digital pop-up book that asks us to examine the Grinches inside us all, and find the willingness to let some light in."
9002,1,"The Grinch is just a sweet, well-intentioned update of the classic tale, blunting some of the original's harsh edges and replacing its pointed criticisms for a story of positivity and generosity."
9003,0,This animated big-screen version is three times too long and 10 times as unnecessary.
9004,1,"There's no great originality or charm in the movie as a whole, but that comedy - coupled with general perkiness - is enough to make it an adequate show"
9005,0,"This is a film that stubbornly refuses to come to real life, with Cindy Lou rounding up her gang in a way that never really grips or entertains and smacks a little too much of Charlie Brown."
9006,1,Illumination's strong suit is creating sincerely adorable characters.
9007,0,"Underwhelming, unimaginative and uninspired, this cold and careless adaptation is severely lacking in the zingers department."
9008,1,A giddy sugar-rush that slows to reveal its big charms.
9009,1,"Fitfully amusing, harmless, and negligible. It neither detracts from Dr. Seuss' legacy nor enhances it."
9010,0,Nothing about it feels organic and fruitful; The Grinch feels like it is reaching an end-year quota.
9011,0,Just another remix of Dr. Seuss' book that attempts to modernize the narrative with zero intention toward creativity or an engaging experience.
9012,1,It's a modernized version of the classic that gives a little more depth to its cranky titular subject.
9013,1,"It's the softness that's most interesting, and what makes the movie enjoyable to watch."
9014,1,The latest adaptation of 'The Grinch' delivers a satisfying and enjoyable product that pushes Illumination Animation on the artistic front.
9015,1,"Sounds like pure sugar, but really it's just sweet."
9016,1,"The Grinch is a remake that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does make enough changes from the original material to stand on its own."
9017,0,"There is nothing Grinch-like to this incarnation. This isn't ""The Grinch"", this is Grinchᴸᴵᵀᴱ."
9018,0,"The bauble is shiny, but hollow inside."
9019,1,"Of course, there are holiday tunes galore -- a few new ones and many old -- with all gloriously capped off by ""The Christmas Song"" from the still one-of-a-kind Nat King Cole. And, just who can possibly get grinchy hearing that?"
9020,0,"Missing the sort of magic a film of this ilk should have in abundance, and oddly feels flat from the get-go through the end credits. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
9021,1,"If you want to give kids an updated version of this story, this works. It's fine, one of those movies that I understood why they made it, but nothing groundbreaking."
9022,0,"I'm glad that they tried to make this feel like a true Seuss story, rather than something to irreverent...I just feel like it didn't have to be this soft. It could've been a bit edgier."
9023,0,It is as uninspired as it is undemanding.
9024,1,I think we're back on the Good Grinch train. It did what I wanted it to do...
9025,1,"This movie's heart, and its story, is definitely in the right place."
9026,0,It just feels like more cute but disposable holiday junk to clutter this increasingly overstuffed season.
9027,1,"""The Grinch"" is a respectable, if safe, retelling of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic."
9028,0,"You're a Mediocre One, Mr. Grinch. Those expecting Cumberbatch to add a little Dr. Strange to his take on Dr. Seuss will be sorely disappointed as this animated take on the Grinch buries its kid audience under a blanket of bland.."
9029,0,"From time to time you'll laugh and maybe shed a tear, but this isn't the kind of Grinch you'll want to see each year."
9030,1,Director Denis Villeneuve never misses and succeeds again in this adaptation with incredible performances especially from Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson.
9031,1,The end result is a movie worthy of the source material.
9032,1,"an incredibly well-crafted adaptation that's faithful to the source material while also breathing new life into it, and an immersive, epic cinematic journey that will absolutely leave you aching for more."
9033,1,"Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One is a worthy addition to the collection, besting the Lynch film in certain ways but still flummoxed and frustrated by the source material’s conversation-heavy downside."
9034,1,"Dune is a masterful sci-fi blockbuster that is going to please the majority of its audience. The visuals are crying out to be seen on the biggest screen possible, easily becoming the movies standout."
9035,1,A true cinematic treasure that will be cherished for decades to come & gave me the same feeling that I got watching A New Hope for the first time. This is Epic to the highest of standards & I need more right now.
9036,0,"The talented cast is in service of spectacle, doing little more than providing the expositional sutures that connect one elaborate set piece to the next."
9037,1,"Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story surrounded by an absolutely massive scale. Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography."
9038,0,Dune is so engaged in getting the plot right and building an appropriate world that it doesn’t have time to let its characters bond or develop a real connection.
9039,0,"Villeneuve can build spectacle and innovative tales because we have seen him do it before, but his rendition of Dune isn’t one of them."
9040,1,"Laced with complex politics, interesting themes on religion, gender, imperialism, and environmentalism; this has just about everything a fantasy/sci-fi fan could want."
9041,1,"Denis Villeneuve’s Dune is simply epic in every sense of the word, from the acting and action sequences, to the score from Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer. The grandeur of the film is accentuated by captivating shots and landscapes"
9042,1,"Trust me, on the big screen, the blue is blue enough to bring the intensity when needed..."
9043,1,"Dune is a true masterpiece. I can’t wait to see how this duology ends, and if Denis Villeneuve sticks the landing, this may be the best science fiction movie of all time."
9044,0,"Five years later, the most cogent thought I emerged from Dune with was, ""Hans Zimmer must be stopped."""
9045,1,"A film is, at its core, a piece of entertainment. While cinema is also a fascinating and diverse macrocosm of art, films like Dune make the case that intermingling approaches to the medium aren’t always possible."
9046,1,"So people of the world, spice up your life and see Dune. So Villeneuve can conduct the final part of this truly epic space opera."
9047,1,"A sophisticated sci-fi blockbuster, Villeneuve’s Dune has an epic scope, jaw-dropping action sequences, and stunning visuals."
9048,1,"Visually epic, but also part of his [Villeneuve's] approach to the screenplay's slow deliberate pace to pull out the novel's more important scenes and storylines."
9049,1,"From its opening shot to the final fade, I found myself enraptured and transported."
9050,1,"The world building and story telling in this film was completely brilliant! Everything had a purpose, and everything was well planned out meticulously. Besides the beautiful cinematography, Hans Zimmer's score shined throughout!"
9051,1,"There was a lot of things to like about this film but when it ended I couldn't help but say to myself ""Damn that's it?"" - Kennith B. Inge"
9052,1,"Villeneuve adds his usual brains and soul to yet another epic blockbuster property and, once again, he’s secured victory. But it is us, the audience, who gets to reap the rewards of his hard work."
9053,1,"What gleams brightest in this take on the tale is its breathtaking visuals, meticulous plotting, a pace that gives the narrative space to breathe and an alluring sense of mystery, as well as the ability to prove simultaneously vast and intimate."
9054,1,"[Villeneuve] delivered superbly produced entertainment cinema, of visual fortitude, aggrandized form, and banal contemplation. [Full review in Spanish]"
9055,1,Generational spectacle.
9056,0,No emotion... just a remarkable tedium. [Full review in Spanish]
9057,1,"While clearly just the first half of a longer narrative, what a thrilling first half this is."
9058,1,"While Dune 2021 is a very well presented and styled gourmet sci-fi dish, for a platter stuffed with ""spice"", it unfortunately lacks a ton of Dune flavor."
9059,0,"Feels more like an obscure, scattered conversation overheard on a long train ride, peaking early with Rampling’s natural mystique, and then hitting a downward spiral – all dense plot and mild tedium, a bounty of sensual imagery wasted on zero substance."
9060,1,Paul's family is evidently descended from a long line of matadors.
9061,1,"The paramount attractions, the visuals, connect immediately. The landscapes, costuming, sets, makeup, creatures and wild special effects are stunning."
9062,1,"Duna works sometimes like a strange abstract opera in which we perceive more the intensities than the representation of the events, and sometimes not only do we not know what part of the story we are in, but what is concretely happening."
9063,0,"To promise a whole series of films might be dressed up as a gift for fans, but theres a lingering cynicism about this project  a feeling that its essentially a way of maximising returns at the box office."
9064,0,"This Dune toys with the idea of genocide, but it’s mostly a movie for people who like to memorize things. All these stupid names, one after another."
9065,1,"Dune might not be for everyone; but if you strap in, immerse yourself in the world and go along for the ride, Denis Villenueve delivers a blockbuster sci-fi epic that's regularly jaw-dropping."
9066,0,A dishwater war narrative masquerading as sci-fi. Pshaw.
9067,1,A blockbuster celebrating the awe-inspiring power of the big screen that everyone can get behind.
9068,1,"If nothing else, Dune wins its place as a masterpiece of adaptation, truncating roughly half the novel into its runtime to expand the books monomaniacal focus on Paul into a more ensemble narrative."
9069,1,"Mature yet juvenile, otherworldly yet pleasingly familiar, “Dune” demands to be experienced on the biggest screen you can find (sandworms!)."
9070,1,"Dune: Part One will leave fans not only wanting, but hoping for more. The spice, in other words, must flow."
9071,1,Dune is another triumph for Villeneuve and I can’t wait to see him finish his epic.
9072,1,Denis Villeneuve’s windswept epic is engrossing enough to maintain an audience with an intermission and a running time twice its length.
9073,1,From the costumes to the enormous machinery and craft of mining spice the film presents a beautifully realised and consistent universe.
9074,1,Dune falls under a high-brow take on science fiction. It is an entertaining cinematic feat to say the least. The franchise has a bright future.
9075,1,"""Perhaps the best, or at least the most revealing, thing that can be said about Denis Villeneuves grandly mounted adaptation of Frank Herberts 'Dune' is that he makes it look easy."""
9076,1,"Many people will encourage you to see new releases on as big a screen as possible. With a masterful spectacle like Dune, its practically a commandment."
9077,1,Its stateliness is both an asset and a detriment.
9078,1,"Every few years, a film arrives that changes the landscape of cinema."
9079,1,"Dune is an exceptional, big-budget sci-fi spectacle, with amazing production values, high-level acting performances, and grand visuals by director Denis Villeneuve."
9080,1,"I recognize this film's individual excellence, but its lasting effect may depend on what follows."
9081,1,"Sure it is long and dense, but the drama of Dune is engaging and it does make the audience care about its characters and stories."
9082,1,Dune is an experience. Let it wash over you.
9083,1,Denis Villeneuves adaptation of Dune is a wonder to behold.
9084,1,"Villeneuve takes a more is more approach here, and that means the scale of this thing is truly epic in the classical sense of the word. But it also means the pacing can feel a bit chaotic."
9085,1,"With the best Hans Zimmer score of the past decade and endless crisp tableaus of jaw-dropping cinematography, Denis Villeneuve has delivered and then some of his mission to give Frank Herberts pioneering novel due diligence on the big screen."
9086,1,"Mesmerizing for much of its 3-hour length - especially during its first half, when it prioritizes statecraft and intrigue and augurs and artful arrangements of strangely costumed individuals and strikingly designed alien vessels over fights and chases."
9087,1,A first chapter to a different kind of space epic that has a maturity to its character that doesn't sacrifice from the spectacle of its action-adventure elements.
9088,1,"More than any movie this year, Dune gave me hope that big screen, big movies, with big ideas, have a future."
9089,1,... incredible -- not just Arrakis but the entire production design... its always a little sad when modern audiences can't be trusted with in-story reasons why characters engage in action sequences.
9090,1,"Though attempts have been made to adapt this work, none seem to have done so faithfully until Denis Villeneuve (Arrival; Blade Runner 2049) with his 2021 release, Dune: Part One, coming available on home video."
9091,1,"Villeneuve's Dune isn't perfect, but it is impressive."
9092,1,Villeneuve's proficiency with both intimate human drama and large-scale spectacle makes him an ideal candidate to tackle Herbert's epic
9093,1,"Dune gives us a reason to celebrate the art of the Hollywood blockbuster for once, instead of condemning it."
9094,1,"Dune's narrative may be a lot less interesting than everything else around it, but there's little arguing with the mastery of the filmmaking on offer."
9095,1,"Denis Villeneuve's DUNE is the type of epic filmmaking that many reach for and can't grasp. Full of emotional resonance and with the philosophical core of the book coursing through the film's veins like lifeblood, it puts other franchises to shame."
9096,1,"Grandiose and enthralling. Dune is a cinematic spectacle powered by an impressive cast, arresting visuals and profound themes. [Full Review in Spanish]"
9097,1,These are complex dynamics. It's a reason why Dune has been so tough to crack in this medium. I think Villeneuve has done it.
9098,1,"If they can maintain this level of quality for the sequel, then there's potentially a new powerhouse sci-fi franchise in town."
9099,1,"When the anticipation is feverish, it sets up movies to disappoint and fail. This long-awaited movie smashes those expectations."
9100,1,"In Dune, Villeneuve dreams big and boldly."
9101,0,...a distressing misfire that seems to confirm that Frank Herbert's 1965 novel is just not suitable for big-screen treatment...
9102,1,"Villeneuve's control of this world, and the sharp precision is wholly compelling enough so that the sheer scope and power of the spectacle feels enough to be thrilling even without answers."
9103,1,"What it has in spades is an unshakable belief in its own world-building, from a drop of sweat trickling down the ear of a desert rodent to the massive shimmering tsunamis of sand."
9104,0,"A slow-moving sci-fi epic that's dry, dusty and lacking in spice."
9105,1,I have a well-documented weakness for sci-fi and expected Dune to feed my soul. I didn't expect it to entirely blow my mind.
9106,1,"Sense of scale is an interesting thing in science fiction, and it's far better communicated visually than in prose."
9107,0,"Dune is a triumph of mediocrity. What it does, it does well enough, but was it worth doing? It's a cookie-cutter movie, a restatement of every trope that now impoverishes cinema."
9108,1,"Villenueve has mistaken humourlessness for seriousness before now, but with a dream cast and a streamlined script, this Dune flies."
9109,1,"The way Villeneuve repeats ceremonial motifs throughout the film is itself ceremonious. ... Instead of explaining its feudal, courtly world, it immerses the viewer in that world's formalist visual language."
9110,1,Killer looks only take the show so far in director Denis Villeneuve's high-flown trip into not-so-deep space.
9111,1,"This is an epic in every sense of the term, and if it's occasionally a little one-note in the thudding portentousness of it all, that's a price Villeneuve is clearly willing to pay."
9112,1,"The showy effects are also offset by an attention to less expected, human-sized details..."
9113,1,It's extremely gratifying to see this kind of massive entertainment being made with such inventiveness and intelligence.
9114,1,Dune feels so tactile and alive.
9115,1,"For all its futuristic technology and sandworms, Dune is deeply humanistic, which does not mean it necessarily celebrates humanity, but rather in the sense that Greek tragedies of hubris and self-annihilation are humanistic."
9116,1,"It's a larger than life film, and though it easily could have rested on spectacle, it manages to have substance in its detailing of tyranny, rebellion, and respecting one's culture."
9117,1,"If David Lean could make a space picture, Dune would be it."
9118,1,"Dune is as much an experience as it is a movie - an orgy of immersive visuals, music and sound that pull you into its enthralling world."
9119,1,Come to theater and you'll live quite deliciously throughout the two and a half hour runtime.
9120,1,Villeneuve's Dune is a triumphantly cohesive assembly of a very difficult to adapt novel by Frank Herbert.
9121,1,Dune is easily one of the best visually & audibly crafted films of 2021. Hans Zimmer's score is perfection. Narratively? hmmm not so much.
9122,1,"Dune: Part One is a stunning piece of work in that context, one that could well be for the ages."
9123,0,"Nowhere near as enjoyable as Villeneuve's inspired Blade Runner 2049, Dune is an achievement for sure, but watching it is rather like having huge marble monoliths dropped on you for two and a half hours."
9124,1,"Perhaps it will ultimately work better when seen in it's full context once Part II is released, but Dune as it stands is a curiously weightless affair, all sturm and no drang, a vaguely intriguing setup that is shockingly unsatisfying."
9125,1,[Dune delivers] visually... and less well in terms of sound. [Full review in Spanish]
9126,1,"A film that is sweeping in scope, rich with the kind of computer-graphics that we've come to expect and characters that -- for the most part -- feel fully fleshed out."
9127,1,Constantly captivating and everything from its big moments to its small details feels unique.
9128,0,An ambitiously stunning piece but for all that comes in between leaves the taste of a bland wet fish.
9129,1,"This is a sumptuous experience, larger than life yet intimate."
9130,0,"This really is a dumpster fire of a movie, so please save your money for something more worthwhile."
9131,0,After is also one of those teen dramas where every emotion has to be underscored by a pop-song and a hair is never out of place.
9132,1,"Adapted from young adult fan fiction, not much happens in this adolescent love story, yet it becomes weirdly interesting."
9133,0,Of such deficient quality that it's unfathomable people will actually pay for a ticket to see this.
9134,0,"The music is fun and the scenery is beautifully cinematic, in a way, but the story itself is neither."
9135,0,"Jenny Gage's sudsy After offers run-of-the-mill college romance targeted to the PG-13 demographic. The result, a far cry from the lustier stories upon which it is based, misses the mark despite an appealing performance from Josephine Langford."
9136,1,"The leads give it all they've got, and Australian actress Josephine Langford is impressive given the limited range of her role. The film looks pretty and director Jenny Gage, to her credit, knows the rhythms of teen melodrama well."
9137,1,It's a movie well made for its target audience.
9138,0,After makes 50 Shades Of Grey look like Anna Karenina.
9139,0,The film's illogical choices and standard teen romance mentality mean nothing that transpires on screen feels remotely fresh.
9140,0,"The first movie adaptation, and it looks fairly safe to say there won't be any more Afters after this After."
9141,0,"The key to the book's success lies in its artful amateurism. It replicates the tone of one teen confiding in another and in this anodyne screen translation, its intimacy is lost."
9142,0,"Where are the real teen romances? This gives us a hint, but the script is so flawed that it's hard to buy anything the characters do."
9143,0,...an often aggressively generic scenario...
9144,0,A lost opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]
9145,0,"Full of light, pastel colors, enormous curtains, [a] bubble bath, and loud breathing while Taylor Swift plays. [Full review in Spanish]"
9146,0,"The performances are spotty and half-hearted, even the most serious of lines are laughable."
9147,1,"Anna Todd's novel adaptation is this generation's Cruel Intentions. The PG-13 rating holds back the story some, but stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin have impeccable chemistry."
9148,0,"As assumed, After is remarkably horny and corny to the point of embarrassment."
9149,0,I endured [the film until the end only because of professional duty. [Full review in Spanish]
9150,0,"Locked In is exactly what you think it's going to be. The plot is contrived. Predictably, the dialogue is eye-rolling, and the character behaviors are over-the-top. This erotic thriller could ruin your Netflix and chill."
9151,0,"Locked In is heavy on plot and light on character, the kind of movie designed to shuttle you from beginning to end before you notice how bored you are."
9152,1,"There are elements of gothic fairytale, psychological horror, and illicit revenge thriller, but Locked In ultimately feels like it could have had its tone a little better locked down."
9153,0,"The climax is so anti-climactic that twists or no twists, it just leaves the viewer frustrated that we didn’t get a tale of rising suspense, rising stakes and increasing peril instead of the movie they chose to muddle out of this promising premise."
9154,1,Locked In is the type of made-for-TV thriller you’d expect to catch on Lifetime on a Friday night. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.
9155,0,"Aping the format and tease of a novel that you just can’t bear to put down, Locked In is instead a film you wish you would have stopped far earlier."
9156,0,Locked In is yet another bland-as-hell Netflix thriller.

9184,0,Locked In is yet another bland-as-hell Netflix thriller.
9185,0,"Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried lurch from car chases to shoot-outs, to a bloodless romantic interlude, while the script runs out of ideas around them, and eventually settles for a lazy Bonnie and Clyde-inspired final act."
9186,1,"There is Hollywood-style action, entertainment, the beauty of Amanda Seyfried as the rebellious daughter of the millionaire villain... and the charisma of Justin Timberlake. Beyond that, not much more. [Full review in Spanish]"
9187,1,"The high concept science-fiction played out in ""In Time"" is as uniquely original, stylish, challenging, and enthralling as it is preposterous."
9188,0,"After the novelty of the premise wears off, Niccol leaves his audience with a familiar scenario fueled by narrative clichés and pun-saturated dialogue."
9189,1,"The acting is solid, if not spectacular... with a little more care and attention, In Time could have been one for the ages."
9190,0,"To quote Cameron Crowe's depiction of Lester Bangs, In Time is a ""think piece"". It's just any thought process will be interrupted by some shoddy dialogue, appalling acting and muddling of tone."
9191,0,The suspenseful adventure that the film prioritizes offers solid entertainment and heightened immediacy.
9192,0,"There's nothing more precious than time. For that reason alone, I'll encourage you not to waste yours this weekend and avoid In Time."
9193,1,Overall this film isn't heavy sci fi but it is a pretty fun ride and good sci fi film with some good use of themes and concepts that are resonating with current goings on in the world.
9194,0,"All in all, In Time lacked time to get the key ingredients - as well as practically everything else that could have made it great."
9195,0,The film's central metaphor is so sublimely obvious it feels like it's been stolen from a forgotten Star Trek script.
9196,1,"In Time is worth seeing and it is clearly made with passion, but it doesn't have the underlying vitality that makes the best science fiction immortal."
9197,1,"In Time is stylistically entertaining, but the story could have been a lot more developed."
9198,1,"Slipping on an expensive suit, Timberlake's likeable lead fits in nicely. He has good chemistry with Seyfried's wide-eyed sidekick... The action is solid too, thanks to those constant deadlines."
9199,0,"It's original, it's compelling, and it's completely mediocre."
9200,1,"Overall, [its] a solid, well-acted, well-conceived and well-staged science fiction film of the classic, quietly cerebral Outer Limits/Twilight Zone variety."
9201,0,"If you're just after popcorn thrills, then In Time is not a complete waste of time, but future generations will not remember it."
9202,0,"Interesting as the film is as a science fiction concept and dull as it is as a political allegory, the Christian understands that there is a fundamental flaw in the story, namely that W.H. Auden was wrong."
9203,1,"I enjoyed the film thoroughly, and realized afterward how well Niccol had drawn me into his imagined world. The first postscreening sight of a digital clock gave me the autonomic ghastlies."
9204,0,The final act kind of just falls apart and the big reveal about the time keeper's backstory fell flat.
9205,1,"In Time, while highly entertaining, doesn't live up to its premise."
9206,1,Don't let the ads fool you: It has a lot on its mind.
9207,0,In Time is so crammed with provocative ideas it begins to feel over-crowded.
9208,0,"One long, extended chase sequence interspersed with awkward flirting."
9209,1,"Even with its thoughtful nods to ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Les Miserables,"" ""In time"" never delivers that transcendent ""Blade Runner"" moment, and never rises above cult classic to simple classic."
9210,0,"There's a lot to like about In Time, but it misses the mark for being an overly memorable experience and ends up being just an adequate sci-fi flick."
9211,0,"""In Time"" gets points for putting forth an interesting concept, but because of Niccol's inability to utilize that concept, we get a film that ends up going nowhere."
9212,0,"Worry, worry and watch the clock, for 'In Time' wastes what time you've got."
9213,0,"Andrew Niccol's dystopia never really feels like anything other than a depthless, stylish sleek surface."
9214,0,"Starts out great, almost like a pseudo sequel to Niccol's other sci-fi drama Gattaca, but slowly unravels into a mindless chase picture that never really captures any real depth or meaning."
9215,0,"Nothing remarkable about this futuristic adventure that reminds me a bit of ""Logan's Run."" Paul Chambers, CNN."
9216,1,Andrew Niccol continues to be the go-to guy for using smartly executed science-fiction/fantasy concepts in the service of expressing ideas rather than bang-up action.
9217,0,"The movie doesn't ask much of them, acting-wise, as it devolves into a chase film and doesn't spent any time examining all the thorny moral quandaries that it brings up."
9218,0,"The movie meanders in circles, frustratingly wasting its intriguing premise showcasing a story of Robin Hood meets Bonnie and Clyde-like heroic villains on the run that's as rudimentary as it is forgettable."
9219,0,"Prophetically arriving at about the same time as the Occupy Wall Street protests, the film couldn't be more relevant; unfortunately, it's also ham-handed."
9220,0,"h skhnothetikh akribeia kai oi sygkrathmenes aisthhtikes pinelies me tis opoies employtizei ayto poy exei apofasisei na kanei, de se afhnoyn na peis thn tainia toy Niccol xasimo xronoy akribws, alla oyte kai gia quality time mporeis na thn peraseis"
9221,0,Timberlake's charisma can't carry this but it's hard to think of anyone who could.
9222,0,"Like a 99 Percenter in the making, Will is stunned to hear from Henry that -- oh my god! -- the system of doling out time is rigged."
9223,0,Nobody should waste a minute of their life on this baloney.
9224,0,Niccol's metaphor gets silly fast.
9225,0,This Bonnie and Clyde couldn't have less on screen chemistry if Clyde was the orangutan from Every Which Way but Loose.
9226,0,"This alternate world's hollowness drains the movie, blanching the noir. Cheesy, corny moments pop up throughout. Grinds its potential down into a clockwork chase movie."
9227,0,...the movie's failure [is] especially disappointing given the enduring success of 1997's Gattaca.
9228,1,Clever and unsettling.
9229,0,In Time is the sort of middling sci-fi movie that you might come across a few months from now while looking for something to stream from the Internet.
9230,0,"The plot is too loose and the action too slack to keep the audience fully gripped. Timberlake and Seyfried are supposed to be the ones looking fretfully at their wrists to see how much time they have to go, not the viewer."
9231,1,"When time really is money, it's hard not to keep looking at your watch. Fortunately, viewing this film won't have you looking at yours."
9232,1,... it works pretty well if you don't look too closely ...
9233,1,"An interesting, literal 'living on borrowed time' premise doesn't quite live up to its ambition but cool film work and Justin Timberlake keep things interesting."
9234,0,"In Time fills its dynamic, sprawling universe with about as much character and drama as a half-hour game of Sim City."
9235,0,"It's a relatively simple but ingenious concept. Niccol, however, seems unable to get the story going without letting the film trip over itself."
9236,0,The endless chases on foot and by car are unsuccessful attempts to prevent the audience thinking about the plot.
9237,1,"The movie may not probe as deeply into its subject as desired, but it's nevertheless an enjoyable watch, full of propulsive action and intriguing scenarios."
9238,1,"Timberlake is fine but not as good as he was in The Social Network because he doesn't get the chances. It's a pity, but this sort of thing needs a brighter director."
9239,1,A playful caper that ticks along on the strength of its cast.
9240,0,It's all just big-budget dress-up in a futurescape that reeks of phoniness.
9241,1,"One of the film's stronger threads poses a key question: even if you could extend your life by decades, would you really want to?"
9242,1,Stylish and original but its confusing middle and overbearing moral message will have you looking at the time.
9243,1,"It's a plot with intriguing issues touched upon, including mortality, the class system and that knowing how much time we have left to live can affect our judgments."
9244,0,In Time is The Adjustment Bureau without the charm and sexual chemistry.
9245,0,"Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried play for time in a monotonous, one-note thriller"
9246,0,A waste of time.
9247,1,"If time really were currency, I'm not sure I'd use up 109 precious minutes on this - and yet, it's just watchable enough to not be a complete waste of time."
9248,0,It's not a total waste of your time. But boy will you wish Niccol had spent more of his on it.
9249,0,"Despite strong performances from a likeable cast, this squanders its potentially interesting premise and is ultimately something of a disappointment thanks to a dumbed-down script, a lack of imagination and a tendency towards heavy-handed symbolism."
9250,1,Is it possible to give a film four stars for its premise and two stars for its execution?
9251,0,Attempts to be both thriller and political allegory but ultimately falls someway short of being either.
9252,0,"If time's so valuable, why does Seyfried run everywhere in six-inch heels?"
9253,1,Good concept and an entertaining cast make this one better than it should be.
9254,0,Such an original sci-fi concept that has a potent economic allegory that rouses interest in the first part then fizzles away as the action and serviceable acting dominates ...
9255,0,"Niccol's major problem is timing: action sequences and dialogue scenes lie flat on the screen, while his tendency to play around with pacing means that any tension quickly dissipates. Life's too short."
9256,1,"Interesting ideas and howling anger at the 1 percent drive the first half, but the Bonnie and Clyde stylings of the second feel a little rushed and strangely out of sync."
9257,0,"A grown-up sci-fi idea suffering from a severe case of arrested (script) development, In Time plays like Equilibrium without the fights, or Total Recall without the fun."
9258,1,"There are some nice ideas thrown around, and the film works as an analogy (albeit it a heavy-handed one) for modern society's staggeringly unjust division of wealth, but it aims to please the broadest audience possible and suffers for it."
9259,1,"Messy and half-formed, but a pleasing throwback to an era in which ideas powered movies more than special effects, In Time provides a steady flow of lively entertainment due to its brain-tickling central conceit."
9260,0,In Time needs a few more rewrites before it can knock on the door of great sci-fi films like 'Blade Runner.'
9261,0,"In Time is half a good film - thoughtful, well-shot, and smart in places - and half a clunky, derivative, and at its worst, laughable one."
9262,0,"The film is beautifully shot in chilly blues and grays by cinematographer Roger Deakins, and Los Angeles locales are well chosen for futuristic effect. Most of the time, however, I found myself glancing at the clock on my own wrist."
9263,1,"For all its flaws, this remains worth some of your hard-earned time."
9264,0,Not one for the ages.
9265,0,"Gattaca and The Truman Show... have trained me to think of a new film from Andrew Niccol... as something of an Event... [B]ut now that In Time disappoints, too, I'm starting to worry that Niccol has said all he has to say."
9266,1,"Niccol's zippy direction, joined to a sleek, rich production design, keeps the movie spinning like a shiny toy."
9267,0,High concept meets lightweight substance in writer/director Andrew Niccol's clinical cartoon rendition of a not-too-distant-future dystopia.
9268,1,...an ingenious and thought-provoking sci-fi chase film.
9269,0,"It's all way too cut-and-dry, an enterprise in which a pedestrian plot and a straightforward aesthetic have been applied to a grand idea."
9270,0,more irritating for what it should have been than satisfying for what it is
9271,0,"A slickly stylized premise, adroitly rigging the economic currency, but the essential chemistry is lacking."
9272,1,"Although the film lacks momentum, the premise and Timberlake's appeal makes it a more thsn decent watch."
9273,0,"The Kiwi filmmaker has done great work before, and no doubt will again, but In Time is a graceless, heavy-handed bore."
9274,0,It falls in the realm of mediocre sci-fi movies that you might watch on cable late in the evening.
9275,0,"In Time starts out with one of the best sci-fi premises in recent memory, and then does nothing with it."
9276,1,"It's the metaphor of time for money that matters, as it plays out in a battle between the haves and have nots - or, if you'd like, the 1% vs. the 99%."
9277,0,"The depth of the world Niccol has created is insufficient, while the metaphors he's employing are far more on the nose than they need to be."
9278,0,"A movie so consistently flat-footed, with pauses between lines of dialogue so vast, that you begin to wonder if the whole thing might be a psychological experiment of some kind."
9279,1,It holds too many strong notions executed too well to let its shortcomings derail it.
9280,0,Nothing more than a clumsily executed preach-a-thon.
9281,1,"Happily, there are some laughs en route. More happily yet, a few of them are even intentional."
9282,0,"Time really is money, people. Invest neither here."
9283,1,"In Time is filled with sly references and obvious puns, as well as sometimes heavy-handed parallels to class warfare."
9284,0,It's a little like Michael Bay's The Island in the way the narrative fails to live up to the promise of its back story.
9285,0,More heartbreaking than funny...
9286,1,"It’s fun, vulgar and represents one of those films meant to be enjoyed on multiple occasions late at night with beers and friends. There exist other things in life that are worse for you."
9287,0,"While Strays is categorized as a comedy, writer Dan Perrault (American Vandal) relies primarily on sex and toilet humor to bring on the laughs."
9288,0,"Visually, director Josh Greenbaun doesn't offer anything surprising.  [Full review in Spanish]"
9289,1,The idea behind the movie is as stimulating as it is absurd. [Full review in Spanish]
9290,0,"If you like dog-poop gags, you are in for a treat. ... If dog poop makes you gag, you might want to pass on this one."
9291,0,"I might have liked it more if I saw it when I was thirteen - although many of the movies I saw back then STILL make me laugh - but today, I can't fully recommend it. It's different, yes, but unfortunately, it disappointed me. Full review in Spanish."
9292,0,"The weird thing about “Strays” is that the few really good jokes aren’t reliant on poop or penises or profanity, but good solid dog humor. … Those jokes are themselves strays, lost and in need of a good home."
9293,1,"Sometimes you get blindsided by a slab of puerile, asinine comedy and you have no choice but to submit to it as your better judgment and notions of good taste expeditiously swirl straight down the crapper."
9294,0,It less resembles a comedy movie than one 12-year-old blurting out “penis!” and 15 other kids giggling.
9295,0,"Strays tries too hard to be edgy without nailing enough actual jokes…Josh Greenbaum’s film aims at something scattershot and scatological, but ends up feeling like something of a dog’s dinner..."
9296,1,"It's uneven and should be sharper than it is, but is the dog movie equivalent of Bad Santa. Very scatological and obscene, but very funny."
9297,0,"For audiences who want to just guffaw over bawdy humour coming out of the mouths of cute pups, Strays will be a winner and will probably have them howling. For anyone who wants a scintilla of humour that isn’t juvenile, they’d best move on."
9298,1,"While cinematic canines have wagged across the silver screen since Rin Tin Tin’s heyday, Strays stands out by recognizing that any “man’s best friend” sentiment does neither side any favors."
9299,0,"An average, predictable script is rescued from being truly irredeemable by an excellent cast of voice actors and a few bright jokes."
9300,0,"Greenbaum and Perrault work the R-rated premise to the breaking point and more often than not, beyond, delivering a steady diet of anatomical and excremental humour with almost admirable regularity."
9301,1,"Greenbaum delivers a tape with abundant doses of incorrectness, but correct in formal terms. [Full review in Spanish]"
9302,0,Takes a promising idea for an adult-centered comedy and blows it by shooting for the lowest bar possible.
9303,0,"Testing the limits of canine cuteness, this raunchy revenge comedy might deserve credit for audacity, but even the least discerning moviegoers will realize quickly it’s more bark than bite."
9304,1,"But that may be exactly why Strays is so funny: It converts the kid-friendly genre of dog movies into raunch, which shocks viewers into laughing -- kind of like South Park and Sausage Party did."
9305,1,"There isn't much more to the proceedings than pooches behaving poorly. Whether or not that's enough depends on your tolerance for crude entendres, doggy-style."
9306,0,"The novelty of hearing a dog say the f-word for the umpteenth time by the twenty-minute mark wears off quickly. That climax is cathartic enough to warrant a rental, however."
9307,0,"Once all those dog jokes are exhausted, it falls back on the characters slinging as much profanity as possible as a substitute for a compelling story."
9308,1,"It is goofy, silly, and filthy."
9309,0,"While the cast are clearly having fun (Forte makes for a hideous nemesis), the central joke -- cute doggies cursing -- quickly wears thin."
9310,1,There is funny stuff in the movie.. just didn't think it was funny enough.
9311,1,Strays is refreshing in how it hits the high notes of sentimentality while also... [speaking] to a greater truth about the animal as something more than merely just an object of affection or as a compliment to human life.
9312,0,"Granted, everyone reads comedy differently, but I just couldn’t muster up many chuckles for a film I could have seen myself enjoying more if it was handled better."
9313,1,"With a stellar cast of comedic talent and plot twists few will see coming, this film is a real mutts-see for lovers of rude comedy."
9314,1,"The film may target the juvenile funny bone of dog lovers, but it works in spades on that level without ever neutering its own profane sense of humor. Never say that critics can't enjoy a film paved with poop, pee and humping."
9315,1,"Strays pawed its way into my heart, and I’m not even that much of a dog lover."
9316,1,"At a certain point I realised it was funny, and rather touching, and that I was having fun. In other words, I was pleasantly surprised. Or, given its frequent scatological content, pleasantly surprised, unpleasantly."
9317,0,Josh Greenbaum’s film is as bouncy and eager to please as a dog playing fetch. But only a few of the jokes it lays before us are properly funny.
9318,1,"An at times heartfelt and enjoyably observed story that may hold interest with more patient viewers but, due to some episodic scene work and slack pacing, leave others restless."
9319,0,Some clever ways exist in how Strays mocks other dog films like Marley & Me and animal-adjacent rom-coms – even as it veers into the predictability it’s critiquing in its own manner.
9320,1,Strays is a quiet summer hit — just leave the kids at home for this one.
9321,1,"Strays is an entertaining romp that may not have much more to offer than its elicit premise, but makes the most of its starry cast."
9322,0,...a rather misbegotten endeavor that could only have worked as a five minute SNL sketch.
9323,0,"Strays is a one-note gimmick than gets stretched to 90 minutes. These are ""jokes"" that would be a side chuckle in any other movie, but they're the main star here."
9324,1,"Yes, STRAYS is laugh-out-loud funny, but it is also laced with a good amount of pathos. In the end, it’s a buddy movie starring dogs --- and it’s much better than expected."
9325,1,STRAYS lives up to its rating and is reasonably absorbing because we quickly come to care about these animals.
9326,1,"While the jokes occasionally miss the mark, Strays commits to its schtick and brings together an excellent comedic cast. The ridiculousness doesn’t always overcome the predictable story, but certain gags are creative."
9327,1,While Strays may not be a film for everyone if you love stoner humour and being made laugh at things you shouldn’t then it is certainly worth a look. Strays will surprise you with some of the important messages it portrays to its audience.
9328,0,"Everything that dogs do -- and doo-doo -- earns plenty of screen time, too, before a crescendo sequence, accompanied by Miley Cyrus' ""Wrecking Ball,"" seriously hits the fan."
9329,0,"To sum up a review with a “dog’s dinner” line would be unconscionably lazy in normal circumstances, but since these pups routinely snack on vomit and faeces, it seems rather apt in this case."
9330,1,“Strays” is wildly inappropriate. It’s also wildly funny.
9331,1,"Strays is as raunchy as Ted or anything Seth Rogen ever thought of, but fortunately it also has a huge heart, and in the end that is why it works as well as it does."
9332,1,"Halfway through my screening, I glanced at my notes and realized that I’d drawn a series of smiley faces."
9333,0,"With a boring script, slightly entertaining performances and not enough storytelling to carry its short runtime, Strays fails to entertain with the story of a dog voiced by Will Ferrell looking for revenge."
9334,1,"The appeal lies largely in the recognition that comes from seeing, unfettered by clean-up concerns, what disgusting thing it’s going to unearth next."
9335,0,"While it is very funny in places, animal lovers may be uncomfortable with the amount of abuse that the dogs go through at the hands of the humans [Will Forte] -  and it may also be too raunchy for some, but smooshing your snout in it is kind of the point."
9336,1,"Strays might be best enjoyed as a surface-level romp that lets these genuinely sweet dogs run wild, but falters when you try and take seriously its adult intentions."
9337,0,"If watching talking canines constantly committing gnomosexual acts with inanimate yard statuary floats your boat, this might be your dream cruise. Otherwise, it could just give you a sinking sensation."
9338,0,"Director Josh Greenbaum and writer Dan Perrault team up for neither of their best work with Strays, a lackluster crude dog comedy whose blessedly short run time is its most redeeming feature."
9339,0,"If the film itself were a dog, it would be a homeless mutt, a dirty, smelly, unlovable street urchin ... it's simply a tedious, ruff watch."
9340,0,It stalls when the humor stops and the violence starts.
9341,1,"In terms of technical wizardry and patience, Strays took a clearly insane amount of work to make its woof-as-you-like comedy a big-screen reality."
9342,1,"Strays is not amazing. But that’s not to say it won’t find its audience.... Because isn't there, somewhere out there, a cabal of big-hearted teenage dudes just waiting to give this disgustingly loveable/loveably disgusting comedy a forever-home?"
9343,0,Past films like Dumb and Dumber showed that stupid comedy can be very entertaining. It just needs to be presented with at least a semblance of effort by the writer to show some respect for the audience.
9344,1,"[Strays] understands the truth, which is: dogs, they're just better than humans."
9345,1,"An aggressively raunchy, gleefully gross and only occasionally truly funny comedy."
9346,1,"Funny at times, and the four-legged actors are adorable, but it suffers from jokes that could have been at least a little higher up the evolutionary ladder."
9347,1,"Much of the comedy is crass yet hilarious, even though they repeatedly resort to toilet humour – literally using urine and feces as a punchline without it always being abhorrent."
9348,0,"Strays was disappointing and predictable and could have easily been fixed if they moved on from overplayed jokes into something more meaningful. The film is meant to be crude, but that shouldn’t overpower the story."
9349,1,It’s little more than an excuse to have dogs spew profanity and engage in raunchy hijinks. I didn’t remotely care because I was too busy laughing.
9350,0,"Though it makes some attempts at finding genuine heart (and does at times succeed), Strays' contrasting tones makes for an awkward watch."
9351,0,"Getting a Homeward Bound for adults wasn’t on my list of things I ever wanted, and while it’s fun at times, overall, it was ok. It’s probably really good to watch at home."
9352,1,"In a cinematic world where the funniest comedies of the year are all rated R (No Hard Feelings, Joy Ride and, of course, 80 For Brady), feel free to add Strays to that prestigious list."
9353,0,It’s oddly difficult to critique Strays because it’s not poorly made and it involves a lot of funny people. But it’s also not good.
9354,1,"... a profane, sporadically funny perversion of homespun family adventures like Disney’s 1963 film “The Incredible Journey.”"
9355,1,"That ""R"" rating means nothing is off-limits and – Foxx especially – can really take the leash off with the improvisations and delivery."
9356,0,"As the script resorts to increasingly laboured gags about humping and poo, you suspect Strays may have worked better as a sketch."
9357,0,"""What if dogs cursed a lot?"" is a funny idea, to be sure, but after seeing ""Strays,"" I'm not sure it was a good enough idea to merit an entire film."
9358,1,"Josh Greenbaum’s comedy is built around a simple premise, which is that watching animals act and speak in profane ways is inherently hilarious. That premise is solid."
9359,1,"Strays is Lady and the Tramp, except the tramp is a perverted little bulldog."
9360,0,"When you have actors like Jamie Foxx and Will Ferrell in the same movie you would expect it to be a laugh riot, but sadly this one is not. I'm still amazed that you can bring these titans of comedy together and really get no significant laughs."
9361,1,"This is not the best in show when it comes to dog movies, but it may be the most raucous. If you command your inhibitions to sit and stay, you're sure to get a treat."
9362,0,"Dogs deserve a better movie than this lowbrow, unfunny adult comedy."
9363,1,"Strays is a loquacious Homeward Bound, and the super sweet yet seriously sour antics of these pooches are filled with filthy, gut-busting, leg-humping hilarity."
9364,0,"Any comedy about dogs has a high standard to meet, in that it ought to be at least as funny as your actual dog just sitting there doing dog things."
9365,0,It’s probably not a good sign to walk out of a raunchy comedy like Strays and being more struck by the level of craft that went into making it than the resonance of any of the jokes.
9366,1,"“Strays” is pretty much a one-joke movie, one last romp at the end of summer. But it finds enough ways into that joke within its perfectly pithy running time to remain zippy and enjoyable."
9367,0,"Strays is a gross-out canine comedy that fails to produce any laughs, leaving it fit only for the doghouse."
9368,1,"We laughed just enough throughout Strays to give it a tepid recommendation, even if a lot of our chuckling made us feel pretty childish."
9369,0,"Strays is a throwback in all the worst ways: An entire film founded on gags rampant in the mid-2000s, fixated on how funny it is that dogs hump and pee on things."
9370,1,"Perhaps it cannot sustain a feature-length film, but if you’re also the sort of person who realizes you’re not above puerile humor – and to be clear, none of us are – then it might be enough."
9371,1,"Strays is a raunchy, R-rated blast"
9372,1,"Profane, outrageous, slapstick and funny in that distinctly stoner-friendly way, Strays also conveys a powerful message about the importance of companion animal care. Nicely done."
9373,1,"Strays is silly and simple, but no less successful because of the silliness or the simplicity."
9374,0,"As a movie, it is not a good boy; it is a bad dog. But if I were currently 12, I might have reacted in a more positive way."
9375,1,"The obscenity is over-egged, especially the dialogue, but Strays comes together with sight gags, heart and a seamless blend of canines and computer imagery."
9376,0,The film’s greatest offense is its lack of humor.
9377,0,[It's] a movie that quickly bleeds its one gag dry.
9378,0,"None of it is particularly novel, and there are better antecedents to revisit rather than watching this. Time to call the SPCA."
9379,0,"he course, foul-mouthed R-rated comedy Strays” is the evil twin of “The Incredible Journey.”"
9380,0,"Strays plays like a movie thought up in a stoner’s house, watching Pixar movies and telling his buddies, “You know what would be funny? If the dog from Up said F*** a lot.”"
9381,0,"Moments of inspired digressions and non-sequiturs are so sporadic they almost feel as if they’ve been airdropped in from a better, weirder film... [and] the screenplay is a pie made up entirely of low-hanging fruit."
9382,1,"When it comes to movies about talking animals, I’m not in the target audience. With only a few exceptions, I hate them. This one, however, is made for someone like me in mind."
9383,1,"“Strays” balances human expectations and lost-in-translation animal experiences for a smart, suitably raunchy adventure that should resonate even if you don’t have a furry friend waiting at home for you afterward."
9384,1,"The purpose of Strays is to disrupt the image that people have of movies where cute animals talk. It's the Jackass of talking animal movies: crude, comedic camaraderie. If you can't tolerate a lot of jokes about bodily functions, then avoid this film."
9385,1,"Seems like a miracle that something like this could be pulled off, fully amplifying and improving upon everything each solo MCU movie accomplished before it, while also standing on its own with the team dynamics."
9386,1,"You wouldn’t accuse 'The Avengers' of being good drama, but the sprawling, splashy spectacle and its much-much-much-larger-than-life heroes makes for a genuine comic book epic for the big screen."
9387,1,"After four years’ worth of building piece by piece against mounting expectations, Marvel and Whedon have managed to satisfy the majority of fan expectations, and in some ways, even exceeded them."
9388,1,Everyone is invested in their character and not one single performer phones it in.
9389,1,"Go back a rewrite the definitions for ""unprecedented,"" ""groundbreaking,"" and those other buzz words."
9390,1,"The Avengers, as a movie, can be best described as one of the most prominent examples of a crowd pleaser."
9391,1,"The story works, the acting is superb, the humor is on key and the action sequences are breathtaking."
9392,1,The 2010s will undeniably go down as the decade of superheroes...
9393,1,"It is the textbook example of a comic book movie, the gold standard to strive for, and a validation of comic book storytelling as an art form."
9394,1,"A mega-budget action extravaganza that succeeds on just about every level, and it's one you should certainly go and see as soon as possible."
9395,1,A perfect example of an ensemble cast and great example of well shot spectacle that also manages to actually develop a lot of the titular heroes as well. Great stuff.
9396,0,"The posing, evil grimacing to denote villainy, and arsenal of one-liners are at an all-time high."
9397,1,The Avengers will undoubtedly please nearly all fanboys and most other moviegoers hoping for the quintessential popcorn flick experience.
9398,1,"'The Avengers' is an amazing madness that guarantees entertainment, fun and awe with the most fantastic gathering of heroes that cinema has ever seen. [Full review in Spanish]"
9399,1,'The Avengers' May Be the Best Comic Book Film Ever Made
9400,1,"Clever, funny, emotional, and downright amazing; The Avengers is a spectacle which demands repeat viewings. Joss Whedon has delivered what is quite simply an epic comic book movie masterpiece."
9401,1,"...not without its flaws, but Joss Whedon has put together an immensely enjoyable film, the best Marvel-based one to date, and one that is not in the least bit ashamed of its comic book roots."
9402,1,"This star-studded, action packed film lives up to all the hype."
9403,1,The Avengers is as close as you can get to a quintessential blockbuster experience. One of the rare MCU films where the action beats feel entirely like extensions of story and character.
9404,1,"Overall, Marvel's Avengers Assemble is fun, funny and downright entertaining. Joss Whedon did good."
9405,0,I think the problem is inherent in the format.
9406,0,"It is no longer enough for one superhero to fight a single villain while dealing with his own personal problems, apocalypse must now enter into it."
9407,0,The movie is not utterly worthless in every way. I'll grant that. But does that mean it's good? Or even adequate? No.
9408,1,Tightly scripted and filled with enough moments of levity to balance the extended and spectacular battle sequences.
9409,1,Gets everything right. So entertaining when our characters gather to fight Loki who is the best.
9410,1,Marvel's The Avengers is the team-up movie that we've been waiting for and it's absolutely everything we wanted it to be.
9411,1,"The film begins with a bang and builds from there, a thrill ride peppered with Whedon's trademark self-aware humor. It's fun to watch all these egos clash, especially Downey, who just owns the Tony Stark role."
9412,1,"The Avengers will appeal to fans of comic books, fans of action and fans of characterization and dialogue. It's a pretty awesome assembly."
9413,1,This all-star superhero extravaganza is fun entertainment at a grand scale.
9414,1,"If you're in the market for one of the most wondrous and entertaining cinematic experience you could ever hope to have, book your tickets, buy your popcorn and prepare to be amazed."
9415,1,"The Avengers is an engaging-enough film. But with that kind of treasure, talent and time, you'd expect more -- a lot more than this completely conventional action flick delivers."
9416,1,It will forever stand as Exhibit A in the case for why the Marvel Cinematic Universe exists and why it continues to thrive.
9417,1,"This is an incredible action movie. From special effects to fights to explosions, it hits every marker. But the movie is so much more. It's hysterically funny, charming and smart."
9418,1,Avengers Assemble does exactly what it says on the tin: the Avengers assemble and proceed to smash things up...a lot!
9419,1,"The Avengers shatters the last barrier separating the printed page and the celluloid image, fully wresting the superhero genre away from the medium that birthed it."
9420,0,"Sounds kind of corny, you say? Oh, that's nothing. Massive corn-shucking in this film, corn piled everywhere, cornpone, corn fritters, corn syrup, corn as high as an elephant's eye, the Feast of Our Great God Corn!"
9421,1,"This is what a comic book movie should be: thrilling, exciting and surprisingly, almost shockingly, human."
9422,1,Achieves something more than just a competent wrangling of diverse comic book stories: it manages to keep Hollywood egos in check
9423,1,Black Widow has so much potential! We hope they seize on it within the next 6 years! *a tumbleweed blows by*
9424,1,"The final action scene, which runs for over half-an-hour, is awe-inspiring."
9425,1,For an action movie there are a lot of genuinely funny lines. There were parts of this movie that had my laughing out loud.
9426,1,Probably the best superhero/comics movie of all time. [Full review in Spanish]
9427,1,It works on nearly every level and is a testament to a great director working with a great group of actors and a studio that knew when to get out of the way and let the creatives be creative.
9428,1,"[The Avengers] is fast-paced, funny, thrilling and well-crafted."
9429,1,"The comedic timing, coupled with his ability to maintain the authenticity of the characters, is worthy of praise. The Avengers delivers a popcorn feast that's the perfect summer kickoff."
9430,1,Just the right combination of affection and silliness.
9431,1,"By crafting a winning combination of wonderful characters, brilliant comedy, and spectacular set pieces, Whedon hasn't simply created the biggest superhero movie; he's created one of the best."
9432,1,"What Whedon and Marvel have created here is not just extraordinary, but one of the most entertaining and satisfying comic book movies yet."
9433,1,"Robert Downey Jr's billionaire playboy inventor Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, gets the film's self-aware, tongue-in-cheek tone spot on, delivering Whedon's wisecracks with sardonic charm."
9434,1,[Marvel's The Avengers] is such a pure and unadulterated comic-book movie that it will bring you to tears.
9435,1,A lot of fun.
9436,1,"Downey's Stark/Iron Man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty, but the CGI effects are amazing and, despite its length, the film is very enjoyable."
9437,1,"Infusing plenty of laconic wit into his role, Robert Downey Jr is impressive as ever."
9438,1,"As Tony Stark, RDJ infuses that much needed spark and life into the movie with his superb one-liners."
9439,1,"To get an idea of the overall mood, you have to imagine something starring Buster Keaton, Spencer Tracy, Sylvester Stallone and Marlon Brando, and directed by Michael Bay and Sidney Lumet on a bank of giant green screens."
9440,1,The relentless action mixed with some potent 3D makes for some jaw dropping viewing.
9441,1,"A big, splashy movie in which stuff blows up a lot, yet you go home talking about the actors."
9442,1,Shrug however you might at a story that has to pack so many characters and tangents into 140 minutes; it will still be difficult for me to see beyond the joyous awesomeness.
9443,1,It's little surprise this is largely a terrifically enjoyable experience -- one that'll please both fanboys and the public at large.
9444,0,"This will be loved by genre fans, when all is said and done/ But at two hours forty, you may find it numbs your bum/ Seriously, more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun/ And now I have said all that, I believe my poem is done."
9445,1,"Is Avengers Assemble the best comic book film ever? That's a tough call but it's certainly the most exciting, and a true epic moment in cinematic history."
9446,1,"Joss Whedon knows exactly what comic-book geeks want to see. That's why ""Marvel's The Avengers"" is so immensely satisfying."
9447,1,"If we must have these box-office behemoths, then at least the writer-director, Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, is a lively controlling influence."
9448,1,"Of course it's about one hundred times brighter than Transformers and Michael Bay's imbecilic spinoffs, and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip. But I didn't love it."
9449,0,"The special effects are impressive but not especially imaginative, and the film is unduly protracted."
9450,1,"For all who have hotly fan-ticipated this all-star collection of Marvel's superheroes, you have reason to be excited. You can officially geek out now."
9451,1,The Avengers does have is a solid gold structure that doesn't buckle under the weight of its gargantuan expectations and overflowing cast.
9452,1,"Smart, witty, funny, action-packed and surprisingly cathartic."
9453,1,"The bigger and goofier it gets, the more fun it becomes."
9454,1,A fun light-hearted summer blockbuster that is weighed down by a forgettable villain.
9455,1,"If you're not already a fanboy, it'll turn you into one. It is honestly the most fun I have had at the movies in a long, long time."
9456,0,"After two-and-a-half hours of world-threatening chaos and world-saving derring-do, you leave the theater satisfied, but without so much as a single memorable image (or idea) lingering in your mind."
9457,0,"Joss Whedon empties everything at his reported $225 million disposal to assault the eyes, ears and intelligence with one of the stupidest comic book tales ever put to film."
9458,1,"Whedon must balance the competing storylines and screen time of the actors. He does it nicely, injecting humour and a touch of drama into the action -- and all without so much as a Tesseract to his name. Some assembly required, and delivered."
9459,1,One of the ten best films of 2012.
9460,1,"But one of the most fascinating moments in the picture occurs when Captain America, referring to Thor, notes: ""There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that."" Ah, monotheism versus paganism. Can they exist side by side?"
9461,1,"Whedon has delivered that rare action-packed, special-effects spectacle that is relentless in its eagerness to please and successful beyond its goal."
9462,1,It's Summer's Mightiest Movie. Nuff said.
9463,1,"When all is said and done, Avengers is all sound and Nick Fury, signifying nothing."
9464,1,Was Marvel's ambitious dream for a shared cinematic universe truly worth it? In my opinion: Most definitely.
9465,1,The Avengers is one of the best superheroes movies in a long time and is likely to become a classic of the genre. You would need to really hate comic book movies not to get a kick out of this.
9466,1,The Star Wars of a new generation.
9467,1,"""Marvel's The Avengers"" is a visual comic book and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than that. As a film version it succeeds-one is tempted to say-MIGHTILY."
9468,1,It really is quite something that [Whedon] was able to take so many characters and put them into a movie where nobody gets left behind.
9469,1,"It really is an astounding achievement - a film that juggles an unenviable number of elements; combining what we've seen before, slotting them together and then adding enough depth, action and humour to make this a remarkable standalone film."
9470,1,"Marvel's ""The Avengers"" is the super-hero movie to end all super-hero movies. Why? Joss Whedon."
9471,1,"Without Robert Downey Jr. delivering his witty quips in patented rat-a-tat-tat fashion, The Avengers would largely be a soulless shell of a movie that could be mistaken for a Michael Bay production."
9472,0,"After years of buildup and prequels, ""The Avengers"" is merely average."
9473,1,"The first great superhero team movie, and a film that captures the essence of what makes the Marvel Universe great."
9474,0,"The filmmakers play a conservative game, not setting out to make a great movie but simply making sure not to screw it up an entire franchise."
9475,1,Feels like actual Marvel Comics are being injected directly into your bloodstream. It's simply jaw-dropping.
9476,1,"While it reflects a movie culture that has traded originality for scale - one wonders if there's a shred of originality anywhere in the film - The Avengers is grand, throwaway fun."
9477,1,"It's as big, funny, shiny, explosive, expert, rip-roaringly entertaining an action movie as we've seen in a long time."
9478,1,"Yeah, it's all that. A tent-pole cash cow for the studio, a dream come true for fans, and treat for action aficionados, 'The Avengers' comes at you as the first true ""summer movie spectacular"" of the 2012 season."
9479,1,Wonderful blink and you'll miss them comic beats in the middle of the finale's mayhem. And what glorious mayhem!
9480,1,... The movie isn't so much a work of storytelling as it is a marathon of wish-fulfillment moments for comic book enthusiasts -- punches peppered with punchlines.
9481,1,The culmination of four distinct franchises is an exciting and entertaining product.
9482,1,It's the humor that's The Avengers' strength.
9483,0,"One hundred and forty-three minutes of head-pounding bombast, The Avengers is an exhausting experience."
9484,1,"Whedon's clear fanboy glee is irresistibly contagious to the audience, whether the heroes and villains go at it with fisticuffs or sharp, witty dialogue."
9485,1,"Infinity Pool is intense, nightmarish, overwhelming and, most troubling of all, pretty sexy."
9486,1,"The film isn't bad by any stretch...[but] its attempts to force a semi-obscure parable...brand Infinity Pool with a uniquely Canadian desperation for implied depth through head-scratching complexity that, at times, can feel more film school than Hollywood"
9487,1,"Cronenberg is now going all-in for the cinema of nightmares, with a film that gets under the skin and itches, invades the brain and plays havoc with the synapses."
9488,1,Cronenberg’s universe exaggerates reality to critique postmodern colonialism and cultural appropriation.
9489,0,Spins the head but ultimately doesn't stimulate it.
9490,1,"Don't be fooled by the slick cinematic treatment, Cronenberg's here to push you to think about how you justify your choices. Infinity Pool's a vulgar, darkly humorous, incisive commentary on privilege, debauchery, enticement, and the destruction of soul."
9491,1,"A madhouse of depraved body horror delights that takedown the privileged class in a satirical (and often campy) elaborate panoply of sadism, fixation, dominance, sex, and carnage."
9492,0,"The set up, characters, and ideas are all there—Infinity Pool just could not find a way to blend them all together."
9493,1,The first half of Infinity Pool captivated me as it introduces its interesting concept  & Disturbing psychedelic imagery slowly unravels onto the view of how the rich & powerful are in control of systems. Goth & Skarsgard are STUNNING.
9494,1,"Brandon Cronenberg offers a playground for the privilege with an all-inclusive nightmare vacation full of leashes, bodily fluids, and rubber that satirizes colonial tourism and power dynamics."
9495,1,"If Goth couldn't flip from enticing to merciless so suddenly and seamlessly, Infinity Pool wouldn't be the entrancing nightmare about soulless sound, fury, sex, bodies, life and death signifying nothing that it so deeply and intoxicatingly is."
9496,1,Mia Goth shines in an unhinged exploration of hedonism and the many horrors that come with a consequence-free world
9497,1,"It’s most definitely not for those of weak constitutions -- or faint hearts -- but it’s also not a movie, once seen, you can easily forget."
9498,1,"More than an exercise in calling out greed and perversion, the filmmaker uses his art to give it shape. He approaches the subject with a similar apathy as his characters—presenting a cesspool of drugs, sex, and violence from a position of complacency."
9499,1,"Through a surreal and violent narrative, the film raises questions that delve into the essence of morality and human nature. [Full review in Spanish]"
9500,1,"The film has many narrative and visual layers, so many whims and tangents, that the story becomes a bit anarchic and chaotic, but even with its excesses and delusions, Infinity Pool is fascinating and seductive. [Full review in Spanish]"
9501,1,Take a dip.
9502,1,The set-up is not plausible.
9503,1,"This transition is brilliantly and superbly directed by Cronenberg, who fully understands and utilizes the aesthetic and formal tools at his hands..."
9504,0,It seems a shame that the film’s promising first half is swamped by its second half with its hallucinogenic descent into sex and violence...
9505,1,"... You cannot turn away, regardless of how intense the performances are, how luridly psychedelic is the lighting, how much of an acid trip is the editing, how mordant is cinematographer Karim Hussain's eye for the macabre and banal."
9506,1,"It is a provocative, chilling exploration of moral descent and dehumanization. It brilliantly blends dystopia and hedonism, creating an unsettling atmosphere that leaves a lasting impact."
9507,1,"Infinity Pool dives into the depraved unchecked privilege of wealth and power. Aesthetically - primal, sensual and evocative."
9508,1,"Super entertaining and deliciously gory, with another stellar Mia Goth turn. But this modern riff on Westworld isn't as novel or transgressive as you'd hope. Infinity Pool is extreme but not subversive."
9509,1,"It’s a wacky but quite original premise, and Cronenberg has found some interesting actors to bring it to life, especially Mia Goth, showing that her recent turn as a bloodthirsty starlet in Ti West’s Pearl by no means exhausted her bag of tricks."
9510,1,"Deploying the type of grisly, ultra-realistic effects he used to great effect in 2020’s Possessor, Cronenberg conjures a marvellously nightmarish scenario of bent sci-fi concepts and psychological derangement."
9511,1,Leave it to a Cronenberg to turn a deluxe resort into a death-dealing cloner playground.
9512,0,"A disappointing late January release that will likely come and go, and here’s hoping next time Brandon Cronenberg will use his talent for dazzling visual storytelling for something more involving on a narrative level."
9513,1,Skarsgård is fantastic ... and Goth is even better.
9514,0,"Brandon Cronenberg continues to function as a Mini-Me to his famous dad David, regurgitating Pop’s favorite themes without really carving out his own niche."
9515,0,Plays like a Great Value version of a David Cronenberg picture.
9516,1,"... A psychological thriller-horror that shapes up to be very good indeed, only to become regrettably overwrought in the final third."
9517,1,"It is as engrossing as it is grotesque. Whether you find the film repulsive or sensual, or maybe both, Infinity Pool is certainly worth experiencing."
9518,0,"Somehow, while it offers several disturbing moments, the film doesn't dive deep and remains on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
9519,1,"Infinite death should be seen for its thematic richness and the outstanding authorial signature of Brandon Cronenberg, in whose powerful images lies the germ of interesting debates and suffocating nightmares. [Full review in Spanish]"
9520,1,"While it’s too extreme for blockbuster audiences, Infinity Pool will satisfy those with a taste for the unusual. It also shows Cronenberg is more than a clone of his father."
9521,1,"Brandon Cronenberg is more focussed on visually arresting imagery than mining the material for something unnervingly resonant. That said, there's a terrific sense of menace."
9522,1,"Things all get a bit Clockwork Orange, with the drugged-up gang putting on terrifying masks and breaking into a house to cause horror and pain... Sadly, the movie loses direction, making it more gory than story."
9523,1,"With its ominous soundtrack and atmosphere of escalating dread, the movie unfolds with the uncanniness of a dream, but something is missing at its core: Cronenberg’s gaze has the glassy imperturbability of his father, David, tricked out..."
9524,0,"Brandon Cronenberg, son of David, continues to rehash his father’s themes and preoccupations with this wearisome grand guignol body horror about the primal power of, yep, sex, death and reproduction."
9525,1,"It may not be for everyone, but I dived deep into Infinity Pool – twice – and enjoyed the hell out of the experience."
9526,1,There is excitement and energy that the first half the film that the second part of the film cannot keep up with.
9527,1,"It’s a powerful theme, occasionally leavened by flashes of satirical black humour, and Skarsgård skilfully portrays a man watching in disgust as his soul is sucked out of him, but the film feels stretched at two hours."
9528,1,... The holiday-from-hell theme quickly switches into a sci-fi satire about the immorality of the one per cent.
9529,1,"Brandon Cronenberg definitely has a way with words, but he’s even more of a craftsman when it comes to visuals, especially trippy, CGI-laced montages."
9530,1,"Cronenberg incisively critiques global inequalities in a world where being rich can not only buy you anything, it can allow you to get away with murder over and over again."
9531,1,"It’s a movie straining for more than it’s achieving, moment by moment, but Goth’s toxic energy always holds the attention."
9532,1,"'Infinity Pool' has all of the wit and viciousness of a JG Ballard or William S. Burroughs story, all of it slinky social satire and savagery at every turn."
9533,1,"It’s hard to fault the magnetic craft of this exquisitely unpleasant picture, like a broiling jacuzzi of hallucinatory sex and violence that you might briefly dip a toe into, if you dare."
9534,1,Cronenberg has found a provocative way to explore the sometimes barbarous nature of this easy-to-hate social class.
9535,1,"At times this film is hard to follow and—clocking in at nearly two hours—would have benefited from a judicious edit, but the uneven pacing isn’t enough to spoil such a grotesque send-up of a hedonistic holiday where the rules don’t apply."
9536,1,Brandon Cronenberg’s resort-set third feature dives deep into a blocked writer’s fantasies and fears.
9537,1,"A slick, satirical, insane thrill-ride."
9538,1,"Infinity Pool delights in finding fresh ways to disturb and nauseate the audience. You do start to wonder, though, if there’s anything more to it."
9539,1,"Sensorially stirring, the film succeeds mostly in the visual department by combining saturated colors, image overlapping and alluring tonalities to depict inexplicable oddities, both physical and mental."
9540,1,"Infinity Pool is maximalist in every sense of the word. It’s good to see what Cronenberg is capable of, with big stars and a bigger budget."
9541,1,A solid film with some standout moments and I enjoyed it more thoroughly than Possessor.
9542,1,"It descends into a miasmic whirlpool of sex, violence, and depravity, but it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that Infinity Pool hasn’t really got much to say beyond the fact that people do some fucked-up things sometimes. Who knew?"
9543,1,"Blood-churning moments are combined with a depth of characterisation you don’t always get in more conventional horror fare. In its morbid and provocative way, the film is often funny but it’s thought-provoking and very creepy too."
9544,1,"While it's hard not to wish that the film ultimately had more to say with such an incisive thematic palate at hand, Infinity Pool is nonetheless hard to shake."
9545,1,Cronenberg's eat-the-rich fantasy is equal parts hilarious and upsetting.
9546,1,"Infinity Pool certainly mounts its statement on soul death, but there’s a certain bleached misery to it that keeps the brakes on."
9547,1,"Infinity Pool is a masterful piece of satirical terror with startling neo-psychedelia sequences you won’t forget. It suggests that Cronenberg is not his father’s filmmaking clone, even if he enjoys plunging himself into the same grotesque waters."
9548,1,"A fever dream packed with sex, orgies, dark humour, urine, and violence - it’s a lot. Infinity Pool comes out of the gate fast with a strong first half before settling into a satisfyingly solid second half, providing Cronenberg's best work yet."
9549,1,"It is socially, sexually and economically unsettling, it is deeply funny, and it honestly does a much more interesting job engaging with class gluttony and humanity’s more base tendencies than Triangle of Sadness did."
9550,1,"I still don’t think Brandon Cronenberg has an interesting sense of style, but Infinity Pool injects adequate amounts of weird energy as a substitute through Mia Goth’s effervescent performance."
9551,1,"More accessible than Possessor (and a great deal more sexy), this social satire/class critique features another barn burner of a star performance by Mia Goth"
9552,0,"It wants to say something about society. It's trying, but it doesn't get there."
9553,1,"Regardless of how you feel about the movie, nothing feels quite like Brandon Cronenberg."
9554,1,Dip into 'Infinity Pool' for mind-bending horror.
9555,1,"[Cronenberg's] boundary-pushing aesthetic is weaponized brilliantly in Infinity Pool, an extreme examination of the lawlessness of the affluent."
9556,1,"Verging on camp in a way that recalls Harmony Korine’s own satire of entitlement Spring Breakers, her [Goth's] commitment both transcends and accentuates the film’s fine rote style, making it just barely worth the time."
9557,1,"Brandon Cronenberg delivers The White Lotus dialed up to eleven on the violence scale. A kaleidoscopic, suspenseful, and sick satire that blends the thriller, horror, and sci-fi genres to its will to craft a story fueled by the wealthy’s hedonism."
9558,1,Brandon Cronenberg is one of the most creative and twisted minds in Hollywood. He follows up his 2020 film Possessor with another wild ride in Infinity Pool.
9559,1,"Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsgard deliver some raw and intimate performances that can make you wince, smirk, squirm, and stare slack-jawed at the screen."
9560,1,"[The literal infinity pool] is an apt metaphor for [the film]: a visually & technically impressive effort, requiring care & precision to pull off, but in service of sticking well within the confines of its carefully hidden but clearly present boundaries."
9561,1,"Gloriously unhinged, Infinity Pool is a visceral and chaotic dive into depravity cementing Mia Goth as our newest horror queen."
9562,1,"Infinity Pool will make you squirm, but without the release of a climactic punchline. Instead, this satire of wealth and privilege will leave you stranded in its putrid muck, but perhaps smiling at the sheer gall of its horror."
9563,1,"""Infinity Pool"" offers a prime example of an actor who, upon first appearing on screen, changes the room temperature considerably, recharges the narrative, and practically takes over the movie. Mia Goth makes an unabashed star turn."
9564,0,"That's a fetching premise, but as science-fiction, Infinity Pool feels pretty scrawny..."
9565,1,It's worth overlooking any shortcomings to enjoy the visual treat that is Infinity Pool.
9566,0,"A psychological madness grips James. He starts appreciating the other strange goings-on. The cloning is only the tip of the iceberg and a fascinating part of the film, but unfortunately, it’s where writer-director Cronenberg stops being innovative."
9567,1,"Although some of its themes are not fully explored, it's an original and provoking voyage worth taking. [Full Review in Spanish]"
9568,1,"A pretty chilling and clearcut condemnation of not just the super-rich, but also the human condition at large."
9569,0,...a mostly worthless (and unreasonably heavy-handed) satire...
9570,0,"Ultimately, Brandon Cronenberg’s new movie may not be very good. But at least he’s failing on his own terms."
9571,1,Cronenberg’s envisioning of this world is as fantastical as you might imagine and as bleakly rendered as you expect from the director’s last name.
9572,1,"Infinity Pool is many things -- it’s sci-fi, horror, thriller, skewer the rich satire, and disturbing psychological study. But most of all it’s audacious, exhilarating filmmaking from a unique cinematic voice."
9573,1,"Skarsgård excels at playing men in such profound denial that they barely know themselves and their own desires, desperately clinging to prefabricated models of masculinity instead (see The Northman), and this might be his best performance to date."
9574,1,"Brandon Cronenberg’s latest Infinity Pool, his third feature film after Antiviral and Possessor, brings us a disturbing, yet beautifully grotesque psychological/body-horror/sci-fi mash-up."
9575,1,"The first half seems to hit all of what’s needed, while the second half becomes more excessive. But the performances are undeniable, given the commitment involved. This particularly goes for an unhinged Goth."
9576,0,Infinity Pool’s fantastic first third gives way to a meandering film that gestures towards several interesting ideas but fails to come together.
9577,1,"an ingeniously satiric narrative creation that comments on entitlement, hedonism, and horrific third-world country laws. Infinity Pool is a nasty dark comedy that provokes, but also entertains and attempts to enlighten. It also basks in its own depravity."
9578,1,"Ambiguously haunting with bloodcurdling sensuality, Infinity Pool is not for the squeamish and yet such an impressive and bourgeois bloodbath for those who admire unusually unsettling cinema."
9579,1,"Infinity Pool may not blow minds, but it reliably explodes heads."
9580,1,"With main characters no more likable than those of the Hostel series, Infinity Pool might be easy to dismiss if it weren't such a stunning fever dream of a movie."
9581,1,"The film doesn't play by any rules itself, and, thanks to extraordinary performances from Skarsgard and Goth, it's likely to attract young adults."
9582,1,"Brandon Cronenberg's slick, strenuously naughty Infinity Pool, letting the characters descend into a moral freefall without any real downside gets tiresome fast."
9583,1,"The unsettling nature of the performances, the score, and the visuals combine to create a unique atmosphere of dread."
9584,1,"Maybe I’m overthinking Infinity Pool, which strikes a posture of intelligence but is really best enjoyed as an arted-up lurid thriller with quite a lot of naked people in it..."
9585,1,"The lightweight story was more comedy than slasher, which is good thing if you value laughs more than gore."
9586,1,A fun time-travel/serial killer comedy.
9587,1,"One of the best films of the year, and the most meta the horror genre has seen since Scream, Totally Killer is the horror comedy you have totally been waiting for."
9588,0,"Totally Killer isn’t as great as the sum of its parts, but its playful sincerity and creative chase sequences make it an easy, enjoyable Halloween watch."
9589,1,It's very funny and the suspense works.
9590,1,"The 80s retro sci-fi horror story is what I’d lovingly refer to as a slumber party movie: it’s breezy, playful, and thoroughly enjoyable."
9591,1,Bests the recent lame “Scream” efforts while keeping you on your toes enough and laughing here and there.
9592,1,"Color me surprised because despite a terrible trailer, this Kiernan Shipka vehicle totally delivers. The comedy totally works, the kills are totally good, and the 80s nostalgia totally isn't overdone!"
9593,1,A fun little slasher film with a twist -- a mash-up of two genres that manages to draw inspiration from previous films while creating its own unique presence.
9594,1,"It’s a mix of masked murderers and social satire, as Jamie has to navigate the “problematic” new world she finds herself in. Nahnatchka Khan’s movie is slight but enjoyable, and Mad Men star Shipka is a deft horror heroine."
9595,1,"Fundamentally like Everything Everywhere All at Once but with a TV sitcom aesthetic, the new Amazon Prime Video movie Totally Killer is another mother-daughter story wrapped in genre film packaging."
9596,1,"Make no mistake, the filmmakers know how silly their movie is. They embrace it which is why the film works as well as it does (when it works)."
9597,1,"Shipka’s deadpan, nonchalant manner creates its own comedy as she perceives each situation and reacts accordingly, adding to this already smart script."
9598,1,"Is delightfully in tune with the tropes of the slasher genre, as well as those of 1980s movies"
9599,1,"Totally Killer doesn't attempt to reinvent the wheel. Instead, it gleefully plays with well-worn genre tropes and subverts expectations along the way."
9600,1,"Not as unique or irreverent as Happy Death Day or Freaky, this still provides a nice, modern spin on the 80s slasher."
9601,1,"Totally Killer is akin to a guilty pleasure; while it may easily be classified as a B-grade slasher film on paper, once you see the final product on the screen, you somehow find yourself enjoying it."
9602,1,"For the horror curious, it's a nice way to dabble in the tradition of spooky season without giving anyone nightmares."
9603,1,"A time-travel slasher is far from a new idea. However, director Nahnatchka Khan brings enough heart to the story to keep it engaging for a Friday night. Kiernan Shipka once again embraces her horror side and succeeds in a more straightforward slasher."
9604,1,"In trying to break the tension with humor, too many horror movies undercut their emotional stakes by instead being glib, a pitfall “Totally Killer” mostly manages to avoid."
9605,1,"While Totally Killer knows the themes it’s drawing upon (and doesn’t forget to tell you about it), the story's twists and devotion in fleshing its extensive character base out sets it apart from being not another teen parody."
9606,0,"There are plenty of clever ideas afoot in this hybrid of Back to the Future and Scream with Kiernan Shipka in an appealing, funny performance but it just can't maintain all of them by the climax making this a bit of a near-miss."
9607,1,"Helmed by Nahnatchka Khan and starring Kiernan Shipka, the film is a fun palette cleanser for those dipping their toes into slasher films this season!"
9608,1,"Totally Killer, while not as gory or raunchy as many of the ‘80s teen horror movies it draws upon for inspiration, nonetheless evokes a 1980s teen world of bullying, binge drinking, pot brownies, and oral sex."
9609,1,This time traveling slasher picture is full of heart.
9610,0,It's True Crime Podcast meets Back to the Future dialed down to dumb.
9611,1,"Totally Killer doesn't reinvent the slasher comedy genre, but it's still pretty clever and funny, and deals with time travel in a way that makes sense."
9612,1,"Totally Killer is a horror movie, its decision to veer toward a more comical approach allows it to perfectly mix the two genres together."
9613,1,"We've seen it a thousand times before but that does not mean we will stop enjoying it a thousand times more... Totally Killer is everything you expect from it when you press play, and that's fine. [Full review in Spanish]"
9614,1,"Kiernan Shipka brings her A game as usual. There are a lot of rising young stars in the film, I just wish they got more time to explore their characters, which felt a bit two dimensional. While this wasn’t a perfect slasher movie, it was a lot of fun."
9615,1,"It’s not necessarily a new slasher classic, but it is the kind of film horror devotees can happily kick back and enjoy on a cozy Friday night in October, and that’s a particular achievement all its own."
9616,1,Totally Killer really understands the space it’s working in and has a lot of fun twisting — and slashing — that framework to its own devious ends.
9617,1,"It’s not a classic, but this colourful combination of Halloween and Back To The Future is undeniably a scream."
9618,1,A fun slasher horror that mixes thrills and time travel with tons of Back to the Future references.
9619,1,"A fun, engaging, and heartfelt horror comedy that also doubles as an interesting whodunit..."
9620,1,A slasher genre mashup that leans into the hilarity of it all while maintaining an intriguing mystery.
9621,1,One time period complaint? The soundtrack could have used 10-12 more iconic 80s songs throughout. I’d be down for a sequel to Totally Killer. Maybe that follow-up could explore the 90s next?
9622,1,"The best film that Blumhouse and Amazon have delivered since joining forces... In a genre increasingly inclined toward the leaden, having some legitimate, lightweight fun with one of these ventures is no thing to turn your nose up at."
9623,1,"This is a romp that is fully aware of the absurdity existing in it. It celebrates the good, the bad, and the goofy with equal consideration."
9624,1,"Grading on a pass/fail system, Totally Killer more than earns a passing grade. It's also a perfect way for slasher fans to get themselves into the right frame of mind for a month-long celebration of Halloween."
9625,1,"Sometimes you’re looking for a movie to put on the background while you carve a pumpkin. You’re looking for DCOM vibes. Consider this the Mike’s Hard Lemonade version. It’s not the good stuff, but it’ll deliver the sweetness and the buzz you’re after."
9626,1,"The fact that Khan eventually makes all this work is quite the feat. Whether it’s totally killer is debatable, but mostly killer? For sure."
9627,1,"As far as lighthearted, sci-fi shenanigan B-movie horror goes, you could certainly do worse than the delightful 80s ridiculousness that is Totally Killer."
9628,1,"The intelligent comedy and snarky retorts work, the violence is brutal and gory, and the mystery is convoluted enough to keep it intriguing and not too obvious."
9629,1,There are lots of big laughs here as the story spoofs both the 1980s and the conventions of its genre inspirations.
9630,1,A thoroughly enjoyable Back to the Future x Scream mashup that deserves your attention.
9631,1,An enjoyably self-aware time travel slasher film.
9632,1,"Fun, scary and unsurprisingly a little bit silly, Totally Killer hits all the right notes in all the right places for horror fans who just want to have fun."
9633,1,"Enthusiasm and good intention win the day, but just barely, making Totally Killer something of a muffled scream in the horror-comedy realm."
9634,1,"Offsetting some of the terrible remakes, sequels, and book adaptations littering theaters, Totally Killer should give everyone hope that the comedy/horror genre is alive and well."
9635,1,"When Totally Killer leans into shamelessness, it becomes a piece of frivolous genre fluff amusing enough to justify its own existence."
9636,1,"The cast is great, dialogue snappy and sometimes the story even makes sense."
9637,1,"Totally Killer wants to play by its own rules of inspiration, tell you about it in advance and then yell “high five!” when it all works out."
9638,0,Here comes yet another dose of 1980s nostalgia and some frighteningly lousy editing.
9639,1,"By the time it gets to the third act, it’s much more emotional and dramatic than one would expect, and way more surprising than you’d imagine."
9640,1,"If a low-stakes, loving homage to ’80s slashers and science fiction sounds like a good time, Totally Killer is totally fun."
9641,1,Does this movie slay? Not quite. Is it a fun way to kill some time? Totally! [Full Review in Spanish]
9642,1,"The horror-comedy formula is diluted and less effective more than some might like, however, Totally Killer is on a mission to satisfy. And that’s something it does well with both energy and style."
9643,1,Everyone’s having a lot of fun in Totally Killer; this cast is more than enough to keep the film from sagging beneath the weight of its many in-jokes.
9644,1,It’s the perfect slasher film mixed with science fiction. Totally Killer delivers a Totally cool time.
9645,1,"While it’s trying to do too much in terms of its plot, the film has a great cast & enough heartfelt moments and intrigue to keep the momentum going."
9646,1,… a wacky good time.
9647,1,A fish-out-of-water comedy filled with amusing one-liners combined with time-travel sci-fi that actually kinda makes sense.
9648,1,It manages to be both a scary serial-killer-on-the-loose movie and a high school comedy. It’s a difficult balancing act that they pull off with seeming ease.
9649,1,Totally Killer may not be destined to become a classic in its own right. But the Amazon release is fun enough for a spooky season night in.
9650,1,"Khan doesn’t care to show the most horrifying and slashy moments, and that’s totally fine! It’s a fun slasher movie with campy characters and an incredible cameo performance by Bowen to deliver her ‘Scream Queen’ moment."
9651,0,"[D]espite the entertaining self-aware comedy and a game cast, Totally Killer feels oddly restrained when comes to fulfilling the 1980s slasher genre."
9652,0,There's such a clever conceit to Totally Killer ... that it's just a shame the movie doesn't live up to its own potential.
9653,1,And though the movie has its share of problems—including the usual ones that plague time-travel stories—it still manages to prove entertaining for most of its runtime.
9654,1,"Totally Killer spends too much time worrying about sci-fi mechanics and era-specific inappropriateness to feel like a well-rounded slasher. But it boasts a likable cast and generally entertains, making it an easy recommendation."
9655,1,"While I might have appreciated more sincerity from this (a benchmark of most ‘80s films), what it does with the concept evokes other modern slashers like Freaky or Happy Death Day, a sure sign that the subgenre isn’t quite dead yet."
9656,0,It’s an uneasy blend of genres that isn’t nearly funny or clever enough to overcome its jarring shifts of tone. “Totally Killer” is totally avoidable.
9657,1,It's all held together nicely by a spirited lead performance from Chilling Adventures of Sabrina star Shipka.
9658,1,Totally Killer does a great job at delivering the Back to the Future slasher mashup. The writing is sharp and the commentary on the modern outlook of 80's culture refreshingly pokes fun at both sides. The eventual killer reveal is the only weakness.
9659,1,"Consider it a small achievement. Totally Killer, a movie that channels Back to the Future and a variety of Scream movies, proves watchable and moderately entertaining."
9660,1,"It's colorful and upbeat, with an appealing lead performance from Chilling Adventures of Sabrina's Kiernan Shipka and an amusing high-concept story that's just fast-paced enough to keep from falling apart."
9661,1,"Director Nahnatchka Khan is entering new with this film, but the effort is there, and fun is totally had."
9662,1,"It might not be quite as incisive a piece of genre dismemberment as Wes Craven’s Scream or Drew Goddard’s Cabin in the Woods, but it has a lot of fun poking at the tricks and tropes of slasher movies all the same."
9663,0,"The somewhat gimmicky genre combination may have had the potential to be a winning combo, but “Totally Killer,” directed by Nahnatchka Khan, struggles to muster up enough charisma to stick the landing."
9664,0,"It’s totally frustrating, pulling off its sci-fi/horror mashup with little imagination, no consistently clear tone, and comedy that wears out its welcome before being stabbed 16 times"
9665,1,"Totally Killer put the biggest smile on my face, gave me some genuine laughs, but also delivered on the premise of ‘Back to the Future meets Happy Death Day’!   If you like either of those you’ll dig the charm of this film!"
9666,0,"Slasher activity is mostly uneventful, bringing severity to an endeavor that’s not sharp enough to be a triumphant black comedy, ending up a mediocre chiller instead."
9667,1,"Part Back to the Future, part Scream, Totally Killer blends horror and sci-fi in a fun, fast-paced package that, while not destined to become a classic like the movies that inspire it, is nonetheless an entertaining hour and forty-five minutes."
9668,1,"While I would hope teens and Kiernan Shipka fan base would enjoy this movie, it’s probably made more for the 80s and 90s generation who will think back fondly of that era and appreciate the references, banger soundtrack and questionable fashion."
9669,0,Totally Killer just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense -- and major revelations fall flat because of it.
9670,1,Manages to manoeuvre any familiarity or missed genre opportunities with its committed performances and a surprising sweetness
9671,1,"The ambition often outweighs the execution, but 'Totally Killer' is still a fun and bloody riff on several different genres at once."
9672,1,Totally Killer is a lot of fun and a winning performance by Kiernan Shipka keeps the shenanigans afloat
9673,1,"Behind the grue and the gags, this faux ’80s slasher is surprisingly knowing and intelligent in its characterisation. When was the last time you heard Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees talk about the space-time continuum and the Mandela Effect?"
9674,1,"Despite some gruesome brutality, “Totally Killer” has a very light-on-its-feet quality. But as artificial entertainment goes, this one’s put together with ruthless care."
9675,1,"At times, you can feel the material screaming to be a killer TV series instead, but it's an overall enjoyable slasher with a lot of charm."
9676,1,"[T]hanks to the committed performances from its cast and some genuinely funny moments, this is an enjoyable horror romp that’s worth seeking out."
9677,1,"Totally Killer is the anti-nostalgia 80's slasher film we've been waiting for, filled with laughs, murder, and time-traveling hijinks."
9678,1,"Unique and ambitious, this film is unapologetically silly and all the more fun for exactly that reason."
9679,0,“Totally Killer” is a slasher with little pulse or memorable execution.
9680,1,"Totally Killer is a delightful concoction of horror, comedy, and 80s nostalgia. It's a whodunnit slasher that offers suspense and laughs in equal measure, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre."
9681,1,"Totally Killer may not go down as an instant classic, but it’s still a very funny and totally charming time, thanks to Khan’s direction and a game cast."
9682,0,"There’s some goofy fun to be had here, it’s just a shame there’s not more of it."
9683,1,"Totally Killer may not reinvent the wheel, but its blend of Scream meets Disney Channel Original movie gets the job done quite admirably."
9684,1,"Even though Totally Killer takes inspiration from classic slashers, its combination of high school comedy and zany time travel makes it feel somewhat like what would happen if we got... an R-rated Disney Channel Original Movie."
9685,0,"Its undeniable dramatic, narrative, and audiovisual shortcomings undermine any attempt to, at the very least, entertain with its repertoire of setpieces for viewers over 18."
9686,0,"If they're going to make Statham's Lee Christmas the star, time to latch onto the latest action trend. Set it during Christmas, give it a Christmas pun for a title, wrap some tinsel around a knife, and 5LAY RIDE is a sure-fire hit."
9687,0,A glorified made for TV movie that beyond all odds made it to the cinemas - EXPEND4BLES is a callback to the direct to video sequels that exceeded their limit.
9688,1,"Though the stunts are good, sometimes the backdrops are questionable."
9689,1,"While there is arguably only one extended sequence that truly pays its way, there is consistent value to be drawn from Statham’s work here. Not only as a leading man, but also a lightning rod to spark his co-stars into action when needed."
9690,0,Same old same old.
9691,0,"Though running at around 100 minutes, Expend4bles’s plot is paper thin and brimming with stilted conversation."
9692,0,"While the first three films in the series showed grit and charm as they brought together old and new action stars for B-movie mayhem, Expend4ables is an embarrassing comedown."
9693,0,"Never has a title been more apt, whatever nails weren’t secured in the coffin of this series following the misguided part 3 are more than bashed to obliteration here."
9694,0,"At this point, you know what you're getting into: this is either your thing or it's not. It's not for critics, overly sensitive people, or those looking for a cinematic masterpiece.  It's for those that want to relive those silly '80s action matinees."
9695,1,"It's the third best out of the four, but better than [The Expendables 3] -- and still very entertaining."
9696,0,"What should've been a fun, silly action movie (like its predecessors, and especially the second one), ended up becoming a frustrating experience, with poor visual effects, dumb dialogue (and weak one-liners), and very poor action. Full review in Spanish."
9697,1,"If Expend4bles turns out to be a swan song, it’s a fitting one, since it so neatly encapsulates the series’ formula."
9698,0,"Besides the cacophonous dialogue and spasmodic storytelling on the part of the director, the actors simply don’t appear to have much invested in their roles any more"
9699,0,An embarrassing excuse of an action film
9700,0,The fourth installment of the Expendables franchise narrows its scope with middling results.
9701,0,"This isn't just a bad movie, it is a boring one -- not exactly what you would want in a film that relies on non-stop action."
9702,0,"The series, mercifully, has some potential, but it’s hard to see any of it in this risible, frequently exasperating, piece of sadism."
9703,0,... Lament4bly predict4ble stuff.
9704,0,"Expend4bles betrays so much of the series’ comforts and pleasures, and the roster of action heavyweights (and their characters) that delivered them, that it was really a project not worth doing in the end."
9705,0,The shocking twist during the first act is quickly wasted away when generic Action tropes takes center stage in the most tiresome sequel of the franchise so far.
9706,0,It's just a huge waste of people with incredible talent.
9707,0,"For a franchise that has never really lived up to its potential, it’s kind of amazing to see it find new lows."
9708,0,"The punches were pulled, the writing was bad, and the action was forgettable. 99.9% of this was genuinely bad, despite it leaning into its own ridiculousness. In terms of your watch list, the movie lives up to its title."
9709,0,The worst farewell possible. [Full review in Spanish]
9710,0,"Almost a decade after part 3, old and new faces gather for another slice of pointless action. The script is flimsier than ever, never bothering to create characters while only barely connecting random fight and stunt sequences."
9711,0,Some of the most appallingly cheap-looking digital effects this side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
9712,0,Dull and tasteless. The insertion of “4” [in the title] is unfortunately just about the most clever thing the fourth installment of this action series has to offer.
9713,0,"Expend4bles fails to live up to the gusto and fun of the first three films, despite star Jason Statham doing everything he can to elevate it."
9714,0,"Expend4bles features a storyline that would make an elementary schooler chortle at its lack of originality. This isn’t second-rate 007, it’s third-rate Fast and Furious."
9715,0,"Audiences can expect 90-ish minutes of ho-hum action bolstered by CGI gunfire, blood and backgrounds, very little of which would be convincing enough for a mid-range PlayStation title, let alone a “blockbuster” with a reported budget of $100 million."
9716,0,"It must also be said that most of the jokes aren't good, even if they are in excess in the banter (thinking that more is better does not help in this case). [Full review in Spanish]"
9717,0,"This is a dumb-as-rocks exercise in violence and stupidity, which represents a low for a franchise that was already scraping the bottom of the barrel, and it's on the very short list of candidates for the year's worst movie."
9718,0,"Dull, predictable and completely lacking any good one-liners or likeable characters, the only thing you’re rooting for is the end."
9719,0,The knuckle-headed appeal of this dopey action franchise has finally evaporated with its latest instalment aka Expend-Four-Bles!
9720,0,"Once you’ve resorted to casting Megan Fox as a credible action star, it’s time to wrap it up and call it a franchise."
9721,0,"It is resolutely terrible, far beyond any sort of guilty pleasure viewing. There is no pleasure to be found in this fourth film, only guilt."
9722,0,"I think it’s time to let this franchise die. With a humorless script, an uninspired plot, and the most predictable twist of all time, this film limps along, as tired and creaky as the senior citizens in its cast."
9723,0,"“Expend4dbles” wants to be the kind of movie that’s best seen on cable with commercial breaks or on a beat-up VHS tape, but there are far more entertaining classics that can get the job done. There’s no need to enlist this tired team."
9724,0,Nothing here makes sense.
9725,0,"The action is not engaging, the gaps in logic are overlaid with the loud music, the stunts are silly, and the one-liners fall flat with a soft, apologetic squelch"
9726,0,It mostly left me feeling expendable.
9727,0,Watching the cast of Expend4bles... sweating and straining their way through the “casual banter” section of the screenplay is like watching contestants on The World’s Strongest Man attempting to climb a ladder while carrying a tractor tyre.
9728,0,Might be the new definition of drivel.
9729,0,"This one isn't the worst entry in the series, but it's not very good, either; it has a few amusing character moments and some decent fights, but most of it is draggy and repetitive."
9730,0,"Expendables 4 might easily be mistaken for a straight-to-DVD release that relies more on explosions and R-rated deaths than genuine, pulse-pounding action."
9731,0,"It’s the fourth movie, and the franchise is still trying to decide existential questions like is this about old-school action stars or new wannabes, as well as whether to shoot it for a PG-13 or an R rating."
9732,0,"Expend4bles is rife with clichés, and it is evident that the cast and crew did not believe in reinventing the wheel."
9733,0,"I had a feeling this was going to be bad, but “Expend4bles” still found a way to exceed my wildest expectations."
9734,0,"Expend4bles is a serious contender for the year’s stupidest movie, and that’s not just for the awkwardly stylized title."
9735,1,What we end up with is a hefty serving of unabashed fan food. It’s a movie meal custom-cooked for fans and it should satisfy the appetites of those hungry for more goofy banter and gleefully violent action.
9736,0,“The Disposables” would describe it better.
9737,0,"A cheap and cheerless sequel, Expend4bles gets old real fast."
9738,0,"The characterisations here are functional at best, and attempts at humorous banter between Statham and Stallone feel limp and forced. Still, the action sequences are slick and speedy."
9739,0,"Plot, you say? What plot? In a word: negligible."
9740,1,"Come for the blood, gore and one-liners -- stay for a fun and touching plot twist at the end that I, for one, didn’t see coming."
9741,0,Dumb.
9742,0,"In an action film landscape that has recently delivered great films like “John Wick: Chapter 4” and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” this year alone, maybe it’s time that “The Expendables” retire for good."
9743,0,"If all you want is a body count, then the annoyingly named Expend4bles will satisfy that bloodlust. Just know the same experience can be had at home with a good first-person shooter video game."
9744,0,"Of the Expendables crew, Jason Statham's the one that exhibits any sort of screen presence or charisma. The rest of the crew eels like they're here out of some sort of contractual obligation."
9745,1,"As a super-violent action film comedy, ""Expend4bles has its merits, Stallone being one, even though he is absent for much of the  time."
9746,0,"Expend4bles resembles a rundown car running on fumes and sputtering out its last gasps as it slows to a crawl and a sad stop. The sequel isn’t even an entertaining car crash. It’s just a poorly made, incoherent piece of cinematic junk."
9747,1,...a top-notch entry within a fairly consistent action-movie series...
9748,0,"At the end of the day, Expend4bles is nothing more than one of your standard-issue Statham actioners that proved moderately popular for a decade beginning around 2005."
9749,0,[A] laughably lazy exercise in utility-grade meat-and-potatoes filmmaking.
9750,0,"There are certainly shorter erectile dysfunction advertisements and with more believable settings and backdrops. Forget worrying about an erection that lasts four hours. ""Expend4bles"" can't even maintain excitement for four minutes."
9751,1,"Very little of it makes sense, and slapdash visual effects show in some scenes. On the other hand, Jason Statham ... calls a bad guy a sneaky little sausage. So it's fine."
9752,0,"With the series running on fumes at this point, it’s time to blow it up."
9753,0,"Nobody appears to be having any fun in Expend4bles, so at least we can empathize with the actors."
9754,0,"The novelty of assembling the greatest action stars in history has more than worn off, especially considering most have abandoned the series altogether. If they don’t care for it, why should anyone else?"
9755,0,"Statham fighting skills can't carry this mess of a movie. There's plenty of wasted talent, a weak script, and Megan Fox is horribly miscast."
9756,0,"Whilst its predecessors varied in quality, its fourth outing is comfortably the worst. This franchise is past its prime—time to put it out of its misery and send it to the retirement home."
9757,1,a serviceable action film that will likely satisfy those in search of violence and explosions.
9758,0,"The bar was already so low, and yet this film manages to sneak under it."
9759,0,"Expend4bles delivers quips and kills galore, but to paraphrase Tony Jaa’s character Decha, “The more people you kill, the less joy you have.”"
9760,0,"The clip is out of ammo on this franchise that has NEVER lived up to its potential, and this is the worst of them all."
9761,0,"The fun final act is absolutely not enough to save a movie that is two-thirds boring, but it does at least elevate Expend4bles above the irredeemable third movie."
9762,0,"With such a dismal fourth instalment, it may be time to put the Expendables on ice."
9763,1,"…passable, forgettable action cinema for hardened veterans with an emphasis on nostalgic indulgence…"
9764,0,"To paraphrase the poetic lyricist 50 Cent, I don’t know what you have heard about Expend4bles, but it is mother****** C-R-A-P"
9765,0,"'EXPEND4BLES' is comfortably the weakest entry in the franchise so far, making it look as if the decision to dust off the property following a near decade-long absence was the wrong call."
9766,0,Many involved stopped trying on the first take or third rewrite. It’s just gassed.
9767,0,"An inane, tedious and exhausting action thriller that's heavy on action, but light on the suspense and palpable thrills. It's essentially a long, dull video game."
9768,0,"Expendables 4 is mind-numbing, an awful entry into the series that stood no chance of being one of the better installments in a franchise that — much like its heroes — is long past its prime."
9769,0,The film’s last reel is so awful — so sneeringly contemptuous of our good-faith efforts to play along with these shenanigans — that we leave the theater still thinking of that shot of a corpse's middle finger. It sure seemed pointed at us.
9770,0,Expend4bles feels like a bargain-brand imitation of the series it’s part of — a regression in quality that’s achingly visible on screen between billowing fireballs and splattered noggins.
9771,1,The most bombastic action movie of the year
9772,0,"Expend4bles is a bloated, festering corpse with a gaping head wound floating face down in the river at the bottom of the hill that the buzzards don’t even want any part of."
9773,0,Expend4bles: wh4t a lo4d of cr4p.
9774,0,Expendabes 4 is ambushed by its own utter lack of new ideas or better ways to use the talents of the many charismatic actors who did turn up to work for various lengths of time.
9775,0,"Weirdly flat, unable to cook up exciting sequences for the crew as they slowly assemble to take on a generic enemy in a sequel that’s nowhere near as entertaining as previous adventures."
9776,0,The best that can be said about The Expend4ble s is that it at least it acknowledges Statham is the star.
9777,0,"Passable for fans of the franchise, but by far the worst entry in the franchise. The VFX are quite frankly embarrassing. But Statham is good and teams up well with a very funny Tony Jaa. Far from theater worthy though."
9778,0,It all gets very tiresome. It doesn’t help that the special effects sometimes seem thrown together with about as much care as the script
9779,0,"For all its efforts at wit, Expend4bles offers exactly two kinds of laughs: unintentional (seriously, the explosion effects and green-screen moments are hilarious) and unearned (the joke that lands best is a direct quote from another movie)."
9780,0,"To the extent that The Expendables 4 succeeds, and by most reasonable terms it does not, it’s predicated on pairing ol’ Stath with various other stars to trade testy barbs, affectionate barbs or meaningful glances."
9781,0,"Old-school rough-and-readiness is kind of the point of the Expendables brand and the films have never been masterworks, but now the hokum has gone from well worn to worn out."
9782,0,"It makes for the worst Expendables yet. The occasional moment of machine gun motorcycle jousting aside, it is a largely dull and dreary experience that never feels like it is ever anything more than a hollow mimicry of far better action works of the past."
9783,0,Expend4bles feels less like the next installment in a beloved franchise and more like the aborted pilot for a straight-to-streaming spinoff shoved into theaters at the last minute.
9784,0,"""Expend4bles"" may be the best of the series. This is not a compliment to Waugh's film, but a mere note on how badly this series of films has fared over the last 13 years."
9785,0,"The Nun II might be a slight step up from the slog that was The Nun, but that’s a low bar to creep up from."
9786,1,"Does not claim that its storytelling integrity is more important to it than providing a nice, rickety old thrill ride of bumps and shocks."
9787,0,"It settles for a half-baked story and the same old never-ending series of cheap, lazy, and ineffective jump scares, ultimately making this sequel an even more forgettable horror outing than the original."
9788,1,Director Michael Chaves (The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do it) starts the film with plenty of energy and continues the pacing throughout the duration of the movie.
9789,1,"The Nun 2 isn't as compelling as the first installment, and feels a bit scattered, but it serves as a worthy sequel that expands on the demonic lore, adding in some new jump scares."
9790,0,You’ll lose your faith in this movie before you’re even halfway through it.
9791,1,"From the first scene to the last, this director proves to have the skills for a better screenplay. [Full review in Spanish]"
9792,0,"Despite some effective scares, The Nun 2 offers stereotypical scares and a story that lacks any real urgency and is bogged down in over explanation."
9793,1,"Despite the scares being a tad repetitive, they are made and photographed well, meanwhile, the special effects are first-rate.  [Full review in Spanish]"
9794,0,"...the movie segues into a seriously (and typically) stagnant midsection almost entirely devoid of attention-grabbing, compelling attributes..."
9795,0,There are certain moments from the original The Conjuring that have stuck with me for a decade and counting. I’d be surprised if I remember anything from The Nun II within the next couple of weeks.
9796,1,"Leveraging girl’s school games, gothic locations, and a few decently disturbing moments, Michael Chaves finally delivers the goods missing in his previous Conjuring Universe efforts… even enough to forgive another in a long line of misdirection McGuffins."
9797,1,"While the story is lackluster and poorly told, the film delivers the jump scares and creepy imagery that fans of this franchise have come to expect. The Nun II is an effective thrill-ride and little else."
9798,1,The Nun II is one is one of my genuine surprises of 2023. It is a film that is not only going to be embraced by fans of The Conjuring universe but is going to be universally loved by horror fans as a whole.
9799,1,"The Catholic horror wheel isn’t reinvented, but the jump scares are so nonstop and occasionally clever that I was left wondering: is this the most fun I’ve had at the movies all summer?"
9800,1,Taissa Farmiga returns as Sister Irene for cloistered encounters of the second kind. Darker and more frightening than its predecessor. The gothic atmosphere and shadowy glimpses of the terrifying nun make for the perfect horror atmosphere.
9801,0,"Well made, entertaining, scary Nun of the above."
9802,1,"…The Nun films seem to be successful even as the over-arching Conjuring narrative sputters, largely because they deliver such visually imaginative shocks, even if the connective tissue between the visuals turns out to be rather unimportant…"
9803,1,"A step up (however slight) from the first film, The Nun II is still a mess, but it's an entertaining mess."
9804,1,"The Nun 2 is exactly what I wanted the first film to be - creative jump scares, evenly paced without being weighed down by exposition, and quite entertaining."
9805,0,"The movie then becomes almost a comical race against the clock, “Da Vinci Code”-style, as Irene and Debra travel through various cities until they discover a Vatican archive where they are informed of the existence of the fourth century St. Lucy."
9806,0,"This horror sequel certainly looks good, but rather than spending time on atmosphere or character, it concentrates on powering through its silly story and generating typical jump scares."
9807,1,"Screenwriters Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and especially Akela Cooper, who explore Wan's material with simplicity and cunning, renew the franchise and steer the movie into an almost existential terror. [Full review in Spanish]"
9808,1,"I actually like this better than the first Nun, in terms of its atmosphere, in terms of its mood; and then eventually 4:59 there is some emotional groundedness that the first one lacks."
9809,1,"The Nun II doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it rolls well, and much better than The Nun did. While it might not be the most terrifying or unexpected of the Conjuring movies, Chaves delivers a solid entry in the franchise."
9810,1,A solid horror thriller with some great mystery and some surefire scary images...
9811,1,"It features all the visuals one would expect from a film like this —floating people, characters with demonic voices and red eyes, sudden and disturbing appearances of the titular Nun. It's predictable, but overall, quite well done. Full review in Spanish."
9812,1,"Your mileage may vary on a mid-credits tease that further hints at future directions the franchise will take, yet there's no denying the grip that these movies — like Valak itself — continue to have on us."
9813,1,"I was never bored by this sequel, and even if I always knew how things were going to work themselves out, my eyes nonetheless remained glued to the screen."
9814,0,Send it to hell.
9815,0,"Although this one is an improvement from the first film, it's still not that strong of an entry in the universe. The atmosphere is great and the jump scares are solid, but there are way too few scares and very little of the title character herself."
9816,1,The Michael Chaves-directed sequel is a messy but entertaining one that finally seems to justify this sub-franchise’s existence.
9817,1,"Michael Chaves' direction is as effective as it is lazy when shooting the same idea over and over again, revitalizing us only with a successful plot excuse to link this story within the great Warren saga... [Full review in Spanish]"
9818,1,"If you were disappointed by the 2018 The Nun, this movie is sure to lift your spirits with its scarier, more unpredictable moments and imagery surrounding the antagonist — brought to life by Bonnie Aarons."
9819,1,"This entry absolves the spin-offs' worst sins; it's sometimes sillier than it is scary, but it's never as boring as either its direct predecessor or Chaves's The Curse of La Llorona."
9820,1,"The Nun II certainly has a few cinematic sins to confess, but its creative scares and engaging story make it a fun and frightening blockbuster horror."
9821,1,"I appreciate the artistry of the film and some of the performances, but the story was lacking and they traded it off for cheap scares."
9822,0,"There’s one visually inventive set-piece, but mostly the action is dark, dingy and fatally short of scares."
9823,1,"The Nun 2 isn’t groundbreaking for the horror genre, but with an engaging cast and creepy setup after creepy setup, it’s a solid film in The Conjuring franchise with some harrowing moments."
9824,1,I found the story and creatives decisions made in this sequel to be significantly better than its predecessors. Really solid performances across the board but the story suffers from too many underwhelming subplots that don't add much to the main plot.
9825,0,"A narratively bland sequel that grants star Taissa Farmiga a bit more agency (while wasting Storm Reid), The Nun II proves that while there's plenty of box office in The Conjuring Universe, the storytelling techniques are phoning it in."
9826,1,"The Nun II improves certain aspects of Coryn Hardy's offering, giving the two main characters personality and soul... [Full review in Spanish]"
9827,0,"As a movie, it adds nothing to the Conjuring franchise or to its premise."
9828,0,"Although its visual proposal is interesting, The Nun 2 drowns in its mythology and ends up becoming one of the worst installments in its universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
9829,0,"Poses elements of interest, but this entertainment is covered in disappointment. [Full review in Spanish]"
9830,0,"It isn’t as messy as the first, and the third act delivers the right amount of over-the-top scares, but the story is an absolute dud through two acts. The pacing drags, and almost every jump scare is too obvious to be effective or even remotely scary."
9831,1,"The Nun herself might be no more frightening than a malnourished panda, but around her, the sets, costuming and art direction are often superb."
9832,0,"Although the movie maintains the pace, builds tension and gets to land a few scares, the spin-offs are still way behind the main films in The Conjuring franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
9833,0,A sequel to a spin-off of a sequel with no reason to exist except the most baldly commercial: the Conjuring Universe is the highest grossing horror franchise of all time and 2018’s The Nun is its most lucrative film yet.
9834,1,"The cast, often more talented and skilled than the screenplay demands, delivers uniformly strong, committed performances. Cheaves and his collaborators fill the periodic set pieces with all-enveloping, neo-Gothic darkness."
9835,1,"t is unexpected to like The Nun II so much, but in its over-the-top horror and action filled finale there is the sense of a filmmaker looking to shock and surprise, but to do so playfully."
9836,1,"The Nun II is a masterpiece in comparison to the first film. It may not be anywhere near getting a spot on a list of best horror films, but when it works, it really works."
9837,0,"Not a complete waste of time, though, decidedly underwhelming despite the ickiness. Superbly shot and directed with an understated flair by Michael Chaves, who, along with Taissa Farmiga, gets about as much as can be extracted from an anemic script."
9838,1,"It feels more like a drama than a horror movie when Valak is not present, and while imperfect, it's a fun, scary group watch. Fans of The Conjuring universe should add it to their collection."
9839,0,"The Nun II is an example of nice, safe, major studio horror. By that, I mean it delivers very familiar elements in a pre-programmed way, with no genuine surprises."
9840,1,"A pretty standard religious horror film which lacks the originality & heart of the main Conjuring films.  Still it has solid performances, great locations and some good visuals. Mostly for hardcore horror fans as there's few new elements here."
9841,1,"A slick if familiar addition to the very fertile “Conjuring” universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit."
9842,0,"This has some decent elements, but it gets a bit too convoluted and goes way too big to retain the necessary “it could happen” element of a possession film."
9843,0,This entry into The Conjuring Universe isn’t even bad enough to be amusing and deserves to be thrown on a funeral pyre for its sins.
9844,0,"For the first half of this movie, I was bored out of my skull... but I gotta say, the second half of this movie far better than the first."
9845,0,"The movie has nothing to say, adds no new layers of intrigue to the overall series, and repeats the same tricks ad nauseam; it exists only to perpetuate a franchise."
9846,0,"It's hard to explain how The Nun II even justifies its own existence. Shoehorning a middle chapter serves nothing, and no one, other than to push The Conjuring Universe to nine films,"
9847,0,"The screenplay it's predictable, though it's difficult to find originality in such a regurgitated and tiresome genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
9848,0,Putting The Nun II in IMAX is like serving human excrement on a gold-plated platter. “What if this sucked bigger?” is a bold theatrical gambit and a frequently used political strategy these days.
9849,0,"If you came to see more of The Nun, you do get it - mainly in the form of subliminal imagery."
9850,0,"This happens. Then, that happens. Do they even know their demon nun resembles Alice Cooper?"
9851,0,"If you’re looking for nothing more and nothing less than a film where a barbaric nun slaughters everyone in its sight, well, look no further. Everyone else will be nun too pleased."
9852,0,an utter snooze.
9853,1,It takes everything that worked about The Nun and elevates it while correcting the sins of the past and ramping up tension and scares. A smart script and great performances deliver the emotional depth that helped make The Conjuring films so successful.
9854,0,"The Nun 2 rises slightly from its slumber towards the end, by which time I was hoping for the bowels of hell to open up beneath the cinema."
9855,0,"Amazing to consider how it's actually been a decade since James Wan's The Conjuring released in 2013, and quite less so amazing to see the McDonalds-ification of this horror property at full strength as it stands in The Nun II."
9856,0,"... a technically proficient yet otherwise uninspired follow-up without meaningful twists to drive the suspense, so the plot spins its wheels well before the inevitable climactic showdown between good and evil."
9857,1,"...a sequel that is a nice step up from its predecessor, yet one that still hasn’t fully realized its terrifying potential."
9858,1,"“The Nun II” is a serviceable “Conjuring” entry that expands the mythology while continuing to build the power of its charismatic hero, Sister Irene."
9859,0,"[T]he repetitious setup-and-scare approach ... is much more satisfying than the loud, generic bombast that follows."
9860,0,"There's an overall lack of thoughtfulness in “The Nun II” regarding scares, and Chaves is vehemently loyal to oversaturated tropes."
9861,0,'The Nun II' suffers by taking itself far too seriously.
9862,0,"They’re just trying to get from one jump scare to another, after all. Let’s not pretend they’re thinking about this story."
9863,1,An effectively spooky gothic horror that features several well-structured sequences that will frighten movie fans this Halloween season.
9864,1,"Michael Chaves is growing as a director, and this might be a situation of 2 worlds colliding at the perfect time. Here we actually have compelling characters, some gorgeous set pieces/locations, as well as genuine and creative scares that work."
9865,0,The loud and unnecessary creep chords and jump scares overwhelm the excellent visuals while doing nothing for the weak and insubstantial plot
9866,1,"One could argue that there’s way too much screaming going on — I mean, after you’ve seen the demon four or five times, is it really that shocking? — but that’s a minor complaint."
9867,0,It's the second Warner Bros. horror sequel in as many months (after MEG 2: THE TRENCH) to give short shrift to its titular creature.
9868,0,"The Nun 2 is about on par with the original. Not sure where I fall on this one as the set pieces are great, the production design is eerie, & the genre blend of a murder mystery is intriguing but everything just feels middle of the road… mixed bag"
9869,1,"Visually stylish and atmospheric with some palpable scares, but it's also overlong, unsurprising and unimaginative."
9870,0,"Mostly a lifeless endeavor, laboring to restart the engine of a one-note idea, getting as far as the heavy recycling of scares before the whole thing limps to a dull conclusion."
9871,0,"A random, almost plotless debacle... I was only bored for maybe 100 of the 108 or so minutes of this mess. There’s only so much admiring the production design will do for you."
9872,1,"There are a few good jump scares and the demon in full nun regalia is still an unsettling sight, but the movie is just a little too similar to The Nun—it’s another story about Irene and an ancient demon destroying relic—to feel anything but familiar."
9873,0,"While a stronger film than its predecessor, it still suffers from the same things that plagued that one."
9874,1,Here’s another helping of lavish pseudo-religious hokum...
9875,1,"The Nun II redeems its less-than-divine predecessor, and is packed with plenty of solidly spooky, memorable moments."
9876,0,"Choosing what feels lazier is tough: its relentless, telegraphed jumpscare approach to horror or the empty screenwriting that comes without any real purpose, whether as a standalone story or tied to Conjuring lore"
9877,1,"It’s fine. It’s rated R, so that’s a start, although I’m not certain how it was deemed so problematic as to deserve the “keep the kids away” rating. There are a few creative deaths, almost elegantly macabre."
9878,0,"The Nun II puts a lot of effort into setting up dark and foreboding scenes, but it's all style over substance. This lazy sequel just churns out weak jump scares and tiresome horror clichés about demons and Catholicism. The story has very little suspense."
9879,0,"A convoluted, lacklustre retread of The Nun, only with even more ludicrous plotting and severely diminished scare returns."
9880,1,"The Nun 2 starts as a tepid follow-up but deviates into a rollicking monster mash as the pace escalates, events intensify, and the story buds into supernatural bedlam..."
9881,0,"Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then … not much else, in most cases."
9882,1,"The Nun 2 does a freakily effective job of making a little go a long way, building a moody, broody atmosphere of blasphemous menace within a French girls’ boarding school before getting to the Irene-Valak rematch we’ve all been waiting for."
9883,0,Nun the wiser. This sequel needs its bad habits exorcised.
9884,0,A movie that seems destined to pound a nail into this franchise’s undead coffin.
9885,1,"The movie is terrible and pitiable. Klimov manages, as I say, to convey the authentic relentlessness of nightmare."
9886,1,"Come and See is as harrowing and horrifying a war film as I've ever seen. It may well be a masterpiece, in fact."
9887,1,"Rare is the film that successfully blends intoxicating visual images with unrelentingly grim material, but Russian director Elem Klimov's phenomenal Come and See is such a movie."
9888,0,"The movie is a succession of brutally sincere ""art"" assaults, jammed together like the poorly articulated cars of an old freight train."
9889,1,This is filmmaking of enormous power and feeling even if the film's length mitigates against it.
9890,1,"The power of Come and See principally derives from the inspired performance by Kravchenko as Florya, in what must be the ultimate loss-of-innocence role."
9891,1,"A compelling, harrowing, absurdly beautiful account of the little known holocaust in Byelorussia."
9892,1,Very few war movies from any country -- including our own -- pummel our insides like Come and See.
9893,1,"Director Elem Klimov keeps the human drama of the ordeal in sharp, clear focus at all times, while still giving the story the sweep of an epic unfolding -- an impressive balancing act."
9894,1,"It's apocalypse caught in the act, a spellbinding, dangerous ""excursion into hell."""
9895,0,"There's passion and exuberance in Klimov's work, but the essential crudity of his sensibility undermines it. At times, especially when the camera angles veer into grotesquerie, it suggests a Soviet Ken Russell movie."
9896,1,"An overwhelming statement on the horrors of war, Come and See takes an unusual tack in relating a story of World War II. This is a psychological drama -- a harrowing, grueling journey into a young boy's mind as he tries to survive a very real nightmare."
9897,1,"It has a raw, primitive force that makes you realize how much of our own horror of the last war has been diminished by Hollywood heroics or simply box-office co-existence with the enemy."
9898,0,"These hysterical histrionics would put me off in any circumstances, but especially when emphasizing horror that speaks for itself."
9899,1,"The film is a sustained act of looking, with a minimum of dramatic or character development, and these are sights that leave an indelible impression as strong or stronger than any antiwar film in memory."
9900,1,"Come and See is a stirring, unremittingly powerful war drama that has the rare double virtue of constantly engaging both the eye and the emotions."
9901,0,"142 minutes of lushly photographed Nazi obscenities. While the movie is technically excellent, and the director's point is well made, Come and See takes way too long a look."
9902,1,"By telling the story from a child’s perspective, Klimov gives the horrors of war a new kind of immediacy. Not one born from stern men turned tragically hollow, but from a pure spirit prematurely drained of their innocence."
9903,1,"Klimov’s dramatic vitality, his control of shifting tones, and his mastery of surprise are what galvanize Come and See. Terrifying as this movie is, we always want to know what happens next."
9904,1,"A product of the glasnost era, Come And See is far from a patriotic memorial of Russia's hard-won victory. Instead, it's a chilling reminder of that victory's terrible costs."
9905,1,"Klimov's film deserves to be ranked alongside pretty much any pillar of the genre you can think of, and arguably outclasses most of them."
9906,1,"I do not believe any human being can watch this alarming film and ever be the same. No words can prepare you for this experience. No matter what I write, the effect it will have on you remains the same; “Come and See” will shake you to the core."
9907,1,"Even the word ""masterpiece"" feels thin gruel, reductive -- the film goes beyond the idea of art and the ability to talk about art and it becomes an experience."
9908,1,"They say war is hell, but very few films make that saying true like Come and See."
9909,1,A documentary more perturbing than any horror film. [Full Review in Spanish]
9910,1,"An unrelenting experience, yet it's filled with a kind of grim, haunting beauty that's hard to shake, recalling Tarkovsky almost religious sense of weight in its remarkable evocation of horror and utter despair."
9911,1,One of the most devastating depictions of conflict ever placed on screen.
9912,0,"Come and See is grueling to watch. Klimov gets so involved in constructing a poetical/symbolic framework for Florya's suffering that the film strays into vague, plotless terrain where one dream looks like the next."
9913,1,"""...Come and See is a grueling masterwork..."""
9914,1,"""Come and See"" is a paradox: a visceral freefall into barbarism, but also a controlled, sometimes contemplative descent."
9915,1,...the strong notes of horror that are present in Come and See from the very beginning...advance to the front as absurdity mutates into nightmare.
9916,1,Most of the movie comes as close to what war must be like for the civilians caught in its midst as we would ever want to get.
9917,1,"This is a film that argues for and thoroughly understands the urgent, present-tense, shifting surreality of war. It is not merely a narrative reimagining of that experience."
9918,1,"Even if the acting and sound make it dated, they don't blunt the provocative anti-war message Klimov and his crew were getting across."
9919,1,It suggests that a war's horrors were the ultimate unassimilable experience of the shadowy depths of the human mind.
9920,1,"""A true classic of anti-war cinema""."
9921,1,I have rarely seen a film more ruthless in its depiction of human evil.
9922,1,"Perhaps the most terrifying, nightmarish film anyone has ever made about war."
9923,1,An unforgettable nightmarish vision of excessive violence and cruelty.
9924,1,"Every scene drives home its point, plainly, that man's inhumanity to man is incurable."
9925,1,"a helluva journey, told with with brutal bluntness and numbing, unflinching realism."
9926,1,Or: Ivan Got His Gun
9927,1,"One of the greatest films ever made, Elem Klimov's anti-war masterpiece is ironically named, as those with weak stomachs may want to steer clear."
9928,1,"Stalingrad-born Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is a undiluted expression of cinematic poetry in the service of an unspeakably turbulent anti-war narrative about the 628 Byelorussian Villages burnt to the ground along with their inhabitants by the Nazis duri"
9929,0,"I suppose that never forgetting has its place, but not when it insists on such narrowly righteous fantasies of revenge."
9930,1,"Come and See, the last and most notable film made by the former Soviet director Elem Klimov, is another fusion of popular and vanguard styles, albeit put to more civic-minded use."
9931,1,"In Klimov's unshakable vision, death is casual, safety is impossible and beauty is backwards: this is peerlessly gorgeous filmmaking about absolute ugliness."
9932,1,"Occupying territory somewhere between Ivan's Childhood and Fateless, Come And See is an intimate epic in which all the promise of adolescence is perverted by war."
9933,1,"A relentless masterpiece, and a brilliant study of the cause and effect nature of brutality."
9934,1,A disorienting and undifferentiated amalgam of almost lyrical poeticism and expressionist nightmare.
9935,1,This Soviet-era Russian film displays the horrors of World War II in a manner that makes The Deer Hunter look like The Green Berets.
9936,1,
9937,1,"Scene for scene, Mr. Klimov proves a master of a sort of unreal realism that seeks to get at events terrible beyond comprehension."
9938,1,This is a real horror film -- it's painful to watch and there's no escape through thinking it's only a movie -- and it's correspondingly impressive.
9939,1,Almost too chilling....it haunts beyond the point of entertainment.
9940,1,"Come and See succeeds through its use of nightmarish un-reality -- how we might see these events not through a documentary objectivity, but through an uncomprehending gaze of horror."
9941,1,Come and See sounds like an invitation to a child's game. Nothing could be further from the truth.
9942,1,"a helluva journey, told with with brutal bluntness and numbing, unflinching realism."

9976,1,B_ for the story and great art direction!
9977,1,"At a time when the public is tired of blockbusters repeating the same formula, Mutant Mayhem brings hope. [Full review in Spanish]"
9978,1,"A magnificent film in both form and substance that manages to appeal to both the TikTok generation and those older fans who, like myself, will always prefer a breath of fresh air to a plain and simple ""more of the same."""
9979,1,"If anything is clear in this version, it is that producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who also wrote the script, have genuine affection for all that is absurd about the central concept of the franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
9980,1,"After years of ho-hum installments, this long-running franchise has finally produced something truly original — though its bizarre, often nightmarish vision won’t be to all tastes."
9981,1,"For all the squiggles, it's quite a beautiful and joyous film, and it flows easily throughout its 99-minute running time. ... It's the first animated coming-of-age movie that feels authentic to its characters and very funny for adults too."
9982,1,There's no doubt that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is the best movie in the entire TMNT franchise--it doesn't hurt that it was made by fans FOR fans.
9983,0,"A coming-of-age film that enjoys stylized animation, but somehow on the surface becomes quite boring with its mutant turtles fighting prejudice and acceptance this time. [Full review in Spanish]"
9984,1,"Thanks to a mix of breathless action, brilliant banter and a variety of animation styles (including the occasional flash of live-action), the time with these turtles whizzes by."
9985,1,A spectacularly zany coming-of-age superhero outing.
9986,0,"I dig its bold look and wished some of that boldness was brought to the writer’s room. The film feels too polished, too calibrated, too arranged."
9987,1,Jeff Rowe has successfully managed to keep the essence of every character intact so that the comic book-style animation can take us on a nostalgic trip.
9988,0,"As a grown adult who went in stone-cold sober, I can’t say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem took me anywhere I hadn’t been before, though that doesn’t mean I was given nothing to think about."
9989,1,"As Hollywood continues to strip-mine 20th-century pop culture wherever it can, Mutant Mayhem is worth acknowledging as the rare reboot that harkens back to its franchise origins while presenting something new."
9990,1,The result is a cinematic pizza-with-the lot: a family platter with something for everyone.
9991,1,"A sprightly animated origin story that serves up a big juicy slice of fun for kids and parents, many of whom probably grew up watching the cartoon show back in the 1980s."
9992,1,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is essentially what the title implies. It’s also a quite sweet coming of age story for the heroes who learn that doing things to please people to be accepted isn’t the path to acceptance.
9993,1,"No one’s going to accuse TMNT: Mutant Mayhem of being overly profound or poignant... but its style, energy and imagination give it considerable appeal."
9994,1,"Though occasionally dark and honing a sense of humour that the older crowd will appreciate, Rogen and co. have still intelligently crafted an action film that speaks to a variety of ages, without sacrificing any of its integrity in the process."
9995,1,A fresh take on the turtle's origin story... but I can't help but wonder if we really needed another origin story. Great voice cast and stunning graffiti graphics make it something special though.
9996,1,This is a movie to say cowabunga for.
9997,1,"Gorgeous artwork, sensitively drawn characters and solid jokes have replaced the massive but generic action set pieces seen in previous films -- and not a moment too soon."
9998,1,"With only a slightly underwhelming plot among its infractions, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' flies high on some gorgeously evocative presentation and an untouchably charming take on the eponymous reptiles."
9999,1,"There is a blend of dry wit, infectious energy and genuine inspiration that marks out Mutant Mayhem as the best thing to ever carry the TMNT badge."
10000,1,"This is everything as a ""Turtles"" fan that I could want and to experience my son watching this with the same level of enthusiasm was beautiful. I hope they keep going in this direction."
10001,1,"The animation, voice acting, comedy and heart made this my favorite ""Turtles"" movie ever."
10002,1,It's unfair to compare it to others because it's exactly what it wants to be: it's own thing. [Full review in Spanish]
10003,1,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles may be almost 40 years-old, but they are more adolescent than ever. [Full review in Spanish]"
10004,1,It is filled with hits. (...) A script that channels the unrestrained energy of four teenagers (...) and that wants to speak nowadays youngsters' language. (...) An animation style that reminds of Nickelodeon's golden age. [Full review in Spanish]
10005,1,A great reinvention of the most famous comic-book turtles. [Full review in Spanish]
10006,1,"Mutant Mayhem’s endearing characters, beautifully crafted visuals, and banging score make it the best Ninja Turtles movie yet."
10007,1,"Admittedly, Mutant Mayhem is nowhere near as good as the Spider-Verse films...but it's a really, really good Ninja Turtles movie and further proof that those Spider-verse films were a much-needed shot in the arm for mainstream Hollywood animation."
10008,1,"Best of all, “Mutant Mayhem” preaches the gospel of acceptance. Yeah, they may be different from other teenagers, but the turtles have value, too, Their shell game works and, even if you haven’t seen it in a while, it’s impressive."
10009,1,"Between its cultural competency, the talent, the synergy between the turtles, and the New York City of it all – you’ll be hard pressed to find a more fun movie this year."
10010,1,Mutant Mayhem proves to be an actual movie about teenagers trying to fit in as they discover a whole new world rather than a formulaic heroes vs villains run of the mill PG Adventure. Something truly appreciated in spite of a heavy sugar coated third act.
10011,1,"…a kids/family film that’s smarter than most films for adults, and should cross-over to audiences of all ages; in the immortal words of Y Kid K, get ready to spin that wheel, because these turtles just got real…"
10012,1,A delightful update of the long running franchise.
10013,1,"Mutant Mayhem reminded me of the New York I imagined as a kid, a melting pot of colorful characters living in harmony – and the occasional sewer dwellers. It’s a warm, fuzzy, and enamoring blanket of nostalgia"
10014,1,"The dark, filthy, trashy, gritty, and exaggerated atmosphere juxtaposed with beauty, humor, and pop cultural references is enjoyable from beginning to end, and apt for a wide audience. [Full review in Spansish]"
10015,1,"And Seth Rogen, an adultescent who knows everything except embarrassment, achieves through this formula what is perhaps the best on-screen version of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. [Full review in Spanish]"
10016,1,"This irresistibly crowd-pleasing reboot is a fun, funny adventure with distinctive animation, enthusiastic voice acting, and a memorable soundtrack."
10017,1,"The animation is surprisingly original, attractive, and realistic. [Full review in Spanish]"
10018,1,A successful relaunch of the turtles for a new generation that stands out with its amazing animation & bumping soundtrack.
10019,1,The beautiful animation and narrative rhythm that Jeff Rowe and Kyler Spears impress upon the movie are superior to an effective script that doesn't go overboard with its imagination. [Full review in Spanish]
10020,1,"I'm not really a fan of this franchise, in that I haven't seen all the films, nor have I read any of the comic books, but dang, this film is a lot of fun, even for a non-fan like me."
10021,1,"The animation style is gorgeous, the pacey story packed full of jokes as well as heart about the important of acceptance, the characters are so immensely likeable and hilariously quotable dialogue – this is a total win for all the family."
10022,1,"The animation is endlessly inventive, while the makers also take a leaf out of Pixar's book by imbuing their protagonists with substantive emotional depth and keenly observed character traits."
10023,1,The new animated version of the now legendary Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem - is a triumph. A film that confirms that cinema based on comics only has a future in animation. [Full review in Spanish]
10024,1,It’s a film for all ages with a unique style and attitude that sets it apart from any previous “Ninja Turtles” film.
10025,1,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is full of character and heart, creating the perfect reboot for the modern age."
10026,1,I don't get too excited for these turtles who know martial arts movies but actually sort of enjoyed this one.
10027,1,A reboot of the half-shell heroes boasts kinetic animation and a lively cast while playing gross-out humor for laughs.
10028,1,Mutant Mayhem humorously captures the essence of teenage mutants with a snappy and mind-bending visual style. [Full review in Spanish]
10029,1,"Its ""being accepted"" theme shines through and surrounds it with action and fresh comedy."
10030,1,"The film's animation style evokes the rebellious free-form of a teen doodling in the margins of their school books, propelled by overactive imaginations and inclined as many high schoolers are toward the strange, grimy, and grotesque."
10031,1,A welcome party for one generation and the celebration of another's childhood memories
10032,1,"This time, the Turtles really come out of their shells."
10033,1,"I've seen all of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movies, and this is the best of them by lightyears... Anyone who likes these characters is going to have a ball with it."
10034,1,"Sophisticated enough to show both sides of the destroy all humans proposition (without endorsing human extinction), it's also goofy to good-naturedly play into its premise with oddball characters that somehow manage to have real emotional resonance"
10035,1,"TMNT: Mutant Mayhem is the best TMNT movie ever! A film full of youthful energy, great humor, inspired takes on these legendary characters and one that speaks proudly about the power of family (in all its forms) and the need for acceptance in this world."
10036,1,"There are no gross excesses here, but rather a mix of childish jokes and meta elements that will attract an older audience. [Full review in Spanish]"
10037,1,"It's neat to look at, and it zips by with kinetic energy that nothing else starring these characters ever has."
10038,1,"Echoing graffiti culture, the inventive imagery is rendered with eye-catching attention to detail and directed with boundless energy. And the humour and attitude continually catch the audience by surprise, drawing us in deeper."
10039,1,"The word I would use to sum up 'Mutant Mayhem' is joy – it’s fun to see these characters on screen again where it feels like the people making it are in on the happiness, too."
10040,1,"Honestly, I didn't think the movie was going to combine the truly adolescent characterisation of the turtles so well, with good action, a great visual style, and even fun pop culture references, but that's exactly what it did. Full review in Spanish."
10041,1,Cowabunga! The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are finally in a movie worth watching.
10042,1,"In this movie’s wise deconstruction of its characters, “Mutant Mayhem” does the seemingly impossible and makes the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cool again."
10043,1,TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM is (arguably) the only TURTLES film that's depicted the characters as actual teenagers.
10044,1,"An absolute joy from start to finish, thanks to breathtakingly beautiful, thrillingly original animation, a frequently funny script and a madcap sense of invention that means you never quite know what’s coming next."
10045,1,Mutant Mayhem is an incredibly polished piece of children’s entertainment that takes cues from the best of what’s come before and executes them well. The fresh artistic style provides a facelift to a deeply familiar story.
10046,1,The latest ‘TMNT’ movie reboot is the freshest the 40-year-old franchise has been in ages.
10047,1,"Rogen, Rowe, and team have successfully captured the teenage part of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in this reboot of the IP. Gritty animation, fun dialogue, and a few tweaks to some origin stories give us a fresh take on these heroes in the half-shell."
10048,1,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem has a lot of heart. It's one of the best movies of summer 2023.
10049,1,"The nostalgic 80s and 90s hip-hop soundtrack is sublime, and while the action sequences can be hard to follow, there’s no faulting the film’s fizzing energy."
10050,1,By far the best and funniest adaptation of these endearing characters. There are tons of references to other IPs and pop culture. It's s a good time at the movies for all age groups.
10051,1,"“Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem” is a heartfelt, fun, hilarious and great time. Without question, one of the best animated films of the year."
10052,1,"I watch every single Ninja Turtle show (yes including the next mutation), I’m down for another take of my beloved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
10053,1,"Heavily sprinkled with snappy pop culture references, this new chapter is told in a zippy yet gritty animated style and aims for multi-generational appeal."
10054,1,"Sometimes comes off as a little too slack, with its teen-dirtbag ’90s hip-hop vibe leaning toward oddly languid for a movie that’s for kids as much as it is about them (in turtle form). But it’s just so charming anyway."
10055,1,"The design is innovative, and the nostalgia factor is off the charts, but this still plays like a huge episode of the classic cartoon."
10056,1,"The heroes in a half-shell are back baaaabbyyyy! These turtles sound great, they look great and they still love great pizza. Well, maybe not, because it's always Pizza Hut but still, the movie is pure, uncut, turtle power!"
10057,1,"Mutant Mayhem gives the Ninja Turtles a fresh coat of paint as a welcoming revision with unique animation, compelling characters, and rap music that isn’t just Vanilla Ice."
10058,1,Mutant Mayhem is full of pure Turtle Power.
10059,1,"The animation style is unlike most mainstream pictures, adopting a comic sketch aesthetic that appears rougher and better matches the updated approach to the narrative."
10060,1,"Mutant Mayhem is a SHELL of a good time! The teen voice cast is perfect, authentically capturing their turtle bond and today’s young people. The animation is explosive and creative with relatable themes of acceptance and fatherhood."
10061,1,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem delivers an awesome new take to the cult-favorite franchise that both fan and newcomers can have a good time with.
10062,1,"As a life-long TMNT fan, Mutant Mayhem is the triumphant Turtles return I have been waiting to see for a long time. They got me all warm and fuzzy with nostalgia again."
10063,1,"If a group of animators who once doodled Cool S's with colored pencils, markers, and crayons as kids designed a movie, it would be this one, and it's fantastic."
10064,1,"While it delivers in terms of action and adventure, Mutant Mayhem ultimately works because Leo, Raph, Donnie and Mikey are a fun hang. These are likable and relatable teens even as they walk the earth as turtles carrying swords, staffs and the like."
10065,1,"A fast-paced, breezy and cool-looking animated reboot of the franchise that should appeal to kids from kindergarten through high school."
10066,1,"Lot of laughs, lot of heart to this movie. I really recommend it."
10067,1,"It’s an enjoyable trip to the theater, and the perfect bridge film to unite adults who grew up with the Turtles and kids who are ready for an introduction."
10068,1,"Made up of all kinds of tasteful finesse and topped off with a lively voice cast, 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem' is a delicious slice of chewy, gnarly animated action comedy."
10069,1,As delightful an entry in the long-running franchise as one could hope for — re-introducing the quartet of half-shelled heroes for a new generation of kids while keeping things recognizable for adults
10070,1,"If you've stayed away from TMNT over the years — whether because of ""Cowabunga!"" or ""Ninja Rap"" or Michael Bay or whatever — don't be afraid to break out your swords, shout something that sounds cool and leap back into the fray."
10071,1,"The animation in Mutant Mayhem has a sort of designed raggedness to it. ... It’s polished and crude at the same time, giving the screen an almost tactile sensibility."
10072,1,"I didn’t have much hope for this umpteenth take on the 1980s comic-book relic about rowdy teenage sewer rats, but Seth Rogen and his team of merry pranksters have turned this animated version into a giddy, goofball delight. Cowabunga, baby!"
10073,1,"Yes, the story is simple and the screenplay is thin, but goddamn does the film look and feel good. I’ve been waiting a long time for a fun Turtles flick, and Mutant Mayhem was an absolute blast."
10074,1,"Mutant Mayhem has plenty of butt-kicking, pizza-eating, cowabunga-screaming joy for a new era of TMNT fans"
10075,1,"For nostalgic fans and their young kids, this retread is as welcome as a fresh slice of pepperoni pizza."
10076,1,"It all adds up to a deeply disquieting, and personal, experience that comes from a real place. And you will never forget those icky snapping sounds."
10077,1,"An intense and necessary entry into the canon of pregnancy horror, and one that acknowledges that rewilding is something some women require to fully embrace themselves."
10078,1,"Mysterious and electrifying, Huesera: The Bone Woman is one of this year’s most challenging and best films."
10079,1,Huesera: The Bone Woman is a refreshing look at motherhood and losing the sense of self. Cervera doesn’t rely heavily on jumpscares to elevate the horror elements.
10080,1,"Huesera, a downright effort composed with trenchant expressions and a spellbinding atmosphere, prefers subtle suggestions to overt statements."
10081,1,"This is stunning, crawling body horror that understands that physical contortions and breaks in bones and faceless doubles in swift pursuit carry the meaningful, not to mention foreboding as a toothache, heft no belaboring dialogue can."
10082,1,"Huesera is The Lost Daughter’s spooky sister and Rosemary’s Baby’s modern daughter. Huesera is stifling, angry, and a plea for change on a large scale."
10083,0,"What could be a compelling story of motherhood, different life paths, sexuality, and postpartum depression ends up going nowhere. It doesn’t live up to it’s potential."
10084,1,"Garza's film is genuinely terrifying because it depicts violence in a natural way, an outward crudeness that, far from conditioning us to expect something terrible, drops onto the screen without warning, intensifying its impact. [Full review in Spanish]"
10085,0,"This body horror film is teeming with complex ideas about religion, motherhood, and autonomy, but there’s just not enough to carry it across the finish line."
10086,1,An exciting feature debut by Michelle Garza... [Full review in Spanish]
10087,1,While Huesera: The Bone Woman is absolutely a horror movie—the soundtrack and cinematography are dark and eerie as hell—it draws most poignantly on Valeria’s emotional fragmentation.
10088,1,Cervera uses the entire frame to box Valeria into her new life. Shots are held just long enough for dreadful anticipation to bloom and creep along the very edges of vision. I may not have known what was going on but I was emotionally invested in the ride.
10089,1,"...you’ll often not be sure whether something you see on screen is actually happening in the world of the characters, whether it’s a product of Valeria’s mind, or whether it’s a cinematic metaphor for what she’s feeling and experiencing."
10090,1,"Though murky and ambiguous, Cervera’s film affirms a woman’s right to choose."
10091,1,"A horror film that doubles as a parable of post-partum depression, something with the creeping anxiety of Polanski’s Repulsion or Rosemary’s Baby."
10092,1,"Redolent with the supernatural, the disturbing images of bent demonic bodies are matched by the cracking sound design of breaking bones. This visually enthralling film is centered on Natalia Solián’s striking first film performance."
10093,1,Huesera stages an existential battle between the weight of expectations that come along with heteronormativity versus the reality of queer people who are forced to conform to hetero norms and what happens when they break free of the spell later in life.
10094,1,"A debut feature director with a distinctive voice fluent in local lore, making a forthright statement on maternal ambivalence."
10095,1,Huesera: The Bone Woman delivers plenty of creepy images and convincing acting performances. Just don't expect a clear and complete explanation for all of the disturbing incidents in this effective horror movie.
10096,1,"By exposing the falsehood of one’s presumption of power, the Safdies awaken viewers to the inescapable consequences of their actions and weaknesses, along with the vulnerability of their own fate."
10097,1,"Good Time is a frantic ride, but at the core of the film is the brothers' relationship. Both are desperate to get out of New York and start a new life, even if they have to borrow and steal to achieve it."
10098,1,"Pattinson exudes pure energy, as though he's leaped into the role so completely that Connie has taken over."
10099,1,"Josh and Benny Safdie recapture the scuzzy immediacy they brought to their 2014 documentary-style junkie drama Heaven Knows What, but this time they inject the action with a thrilling nervous energy and drive."
10100,1,"""Good Time"" grabs the viewer by the back of the head like it has a fist full of hair and drags us along."
10101,1,"Anchored by a career-best performance by Pattinson, it's an unforgettable work that will rattle you in all the best ways."
10102,1,"A nerve-wracking crime adventure loaded with thrills, sleazy characters, and a distinctly New York flavour."
10103,1,"Like the revisionist westerns of the 1970s, it takes the conflicted heroes of gangster films and shows them in a different, less flattering light."
10104,0,podcast review
10105,1,"A fun, fiery, fatigue-defying ride."
10106,1,"Pattinson once again proves his abilities to disappear into a fully fleshed out characterization, here as a selfish yet sympathetic deadbeat."
10107,1,"For the most part, you'll either be rolling your eyes or laughing uproariously. Either way, the final scene, which continues as the credits roll, is so unexpectedly gracious and tender that don't be the least bit surprised if a couple of tears spill."
10108,1,The very definition of a bumpy ride. Good Time is a fictional yet powerful tale of the strange limits of forgiveness. Pattinson at its best. [Full review in Spanish].
10109,1,An impressively audacious piece of work...
10110,0,"""Good Time"" is a lost opportunity that misses a great interpretation of the increasingly interesting Pattinson. [Full Review in Spanish]"
10111,1,An essential piece to understand contemporary independent genre cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]
10112,1,The con man's lament
10113,1,What follows is one of those all-night-long odysseys that's taxing for the characters but weirdly fascinating for the viewer (think Martin Scorsese's After Hours or even Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle).
10114,1,"A near-perfect blend of colorful cinematography, frenetic editing, and pulsing score; creating a grungy, rave-like aesthetic that is like nothing else we've seen on screen this year."
10115,1,Reminded me of some of the '70s crime dramas like Dog Day Afternoon.
10116,1,"Safdie brothers have concocted a dive bar cocktail of a film: grotty, thrilling, mind-altering, always engrossing, and not something you'll forget any time soon."
10117,1,"This sleazy, bleak, and primal low budget crime thriller feels like a cinematic punch in the face."
10118,1,"But ultimately, love is what fuels this traumatic night - brotherly love, the love of the chase and the freedom that money provides. GOOD TIME traps its characters in a world lacking empathy, and as a result, there is nothing left to lose."
10119,1,"Good Time seems destined to be a cult classic. It's carried off with such a dazzling intent, and it's got real dramatic ingenuity to go with its more obvious focus on ambience"
10120,1,"Good Time represents a shift for [Pattinson], who turns in his best and most singular performance in this gritty underbelly thriller from the Safdie brothers."
10121,1,"Good Time has a neon color scheme that is hypnotic and intoxicating, a hallucinatory palate that can shift into a bad trip at a moment's notice."
10122,1,"I'm in awe of what the Safdies achieve here, which is neo-noir (neon-noir?) and social realism mulched into a decayed panic attack."
10123,1,An aesthetically nostalgic crime thriller with a career changing performance by Pattinson and an effective direction from the Safdie brothers.
10124,1,"It's a nonstop, adrenalin-fuelled night of bad decisions getting worse, its urgency nodding to Dog Day Afternoon or After Hours. But it's also implicit in incidental social and psychological comment."
10125,1,"Good Time isn't an exuberant or happy-go-lucky emotional ride, rather it's the cruel irony of white privileged in even the lowest rungs of class."
10126,1,"""Good Time"" really isn't a good time at the movies. But it's worth watching to see a cold-eyed, street-level deconstruction of a night - and life - of crime."
10127,1,Good Time certainly puts the audience through an anxious time as Connie goes on a desperate odyssey through the night streets trying to put things right.
10128,0,"By the end of ""Good Time,"" you might well find yourself begging for a less successfully realistic film, for it is so effectively rendered that you will experience a lifetime of hardships right along with Pattinson and his unfortunate cohorts."
10129,0,"It tries far too hard to be rough around the edges, but it's rather devoid of emotion. Pattinson is good, but his performance never elevates the film."
10130,1,The social commentary that runs throughout especially on people on the fringes of society and the harsher treatment people of colour suffer is well done with a lightness of touch that allows the viewer to reflect rather than feel manipulated...
10131,1,"Relentless and intoxicating, Good Time is a manic and devious exploration of greed. It skewers a particular grifter persona that thrives on uncertainty and sabotage, someone who looks in the mirror and mistakes guilt for good intentions."
10132,1,A violently hypnotic street-wise NYC crime thriller.
10133,1,"Josh and Benny Safdie have created a masterpiece in Good Time, a film of nerve, audacity, and ugliness that recaptures the cheap and broken energy of color 1970s New York crime movies."
10134,1,"Before you grind your teeth reliving the trauma that were the five Twlight movie [Robert Pattinson] previously starred in, he's actually great."
10135,1,"Pattinson's Connie is a classic anti-hero, repellent and attractive at the same time: You want him to keep finding an escape hatch, but you also want him to be caught in the end."
10136,1,A great job where form and background are taken almost to perfection. [Full Review in Spanish]
10137,1,"I wouldn't say I had a ""good time"" watching this film, but I definitely recommend it to those who want to see an stylised and hypnotising thriller. [Full review in Spanish]"
10138,1,Set up almost like a modern-day version of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men - if all the characters in the classic novel were tripping on acid.
10139,1,"Filled with striking images, excitingly disorienting action sequences and strong performances, Good Times ... is in many ways a marvel of ... low-budget filmmaking."
10140,1,This is a gorgeous movie about ugly people.
10141,1,"The Safdie brothers prefer to entertain and maintain an agile rhythm instead of delving into their characters or their ideas, something that the film would have appreciated very much. [Full review in Spanish]"
10142,1,The title might suggest fun - an idea reinforced by the use of an amusement park as a key location - but Good Time concerns a man's frantic and increasingly doomed dash through nocturnal New York to prevent a loved one doing a very different kind of time.
10143,1,"The movie is life a party, like a synthetic climax in perpetual boom. [Full Review in Spanish]"
10144,1,"Despite the recognizable elements, everything in Good Time is instinctive, unpredictable and disconcerting. [Full Review in Spanish]"
10145,1,... Connie is a fascinating anti-hero. [Full review in Spanish]
10146,1,"One of 2017's most beautiful movies, despite only ever training its gaze on ugly things."
10147,1,"The Safdie brothers, despite having a cast of popular actors... manage to retain their independent essence, never giving in to the usual vain whims of stars... [Full review in Spanish]"
10148,1,The third feature film by the Safdie brothers takes us through a narrative constellation that expands as we travel through New York. [Full review in Spanish]
10149,1,"What if Abel Ferrara made After Hours? The result would be the jittery, electro-infused New York nightmare Good Time. And that result is a pure cinematic thrill."
10150,1,"This crime drama of a bank robber trying to get his brother out of police custody features non-stop improvisation. This is a character worth following, and Robert Pattinson is an actor to watch. Benny Safdie is also a writer and director on the rise."
10151,1,"Even a deliberately flat ending escapes criticism, highlighting the brutal naturalism of the piece. The Safdies are following the old adage of always leave them wanting more, which is exactly what you want after a Good Time."
10152,1,"The ticking clock thriller gets an indie makeover and the result is a pulse-quickening ride that, in entertainment value, beats anything that mainstream cinema has made in a while."
10153,1,"It never feels terribly organic, but it is consistently entertaining, even as it gets increasingly violent. And the driving theme of brotherly love gives the film an unexpected emotional soul."
10154,1,"There is a jungle out there, and inside every house and every hospital room, that the Heaven Knows What directors know how to combine and conjugate in relation to the protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]"
10155,1,Powerful beyond the stereotypes. [Full Review in Spanish]
10156,1,"Directors Josh and Benny Safdie are again utilizing heavily synthesized music and electronic beats that propel momentum forward just as kinetically as each character's next, usually bad, choice"
10157,1,"Nick's character doesn't exactly develop, but we do see its innards teased gradually apart. Ben Safdie's touching performance bookends the film with enormous grace."
10158,1,"The film's assuredness of tone, pace and form illustrate clearly the deftness of the direction from Benny and Josh Safdie and mark them out as singular talents."
10159,1,Pattinson nails a back-breaking role and the Safdies direct with an unrelenting visceral edge.
10160,1,"The plot may be circular, but the rhythm of the film, edited down to a lean 101 minutes and driven by the surging synth riffs of Daniel Lopatin's score, is one of urgent forward momentum."
10161,1,"With a style harking back to early Scorsese, the film teases out a bloody terrific turn from Pattinson ..."
10162,1,"Pattinson is utterly convincing as the Manson-eyed Connie, a manipulative force of nature (alternately mesmerising, repugnant and pathetic) who leaves a trail of destruction in his wake."
10163,1,"This isn't a misleading title. With its adrenaline rush pacing, terrific performances and unpredictable script, this is a film that doesn't stop surprising or entertaining."
10164,1,"The masterstroke of the script is how it takes a situation that, in almost any other film of this type, would be played for pathos... and instead strip-mines it for every last iota of moral ambiguity."
10165,1,"While it can be argued that things become too far-fetched and skittish in places, the thrill here is that you really don't know what's going to happen next"
10166,1,"Good Time feels like a throwback to 1970s classics like Mean Streets or Dog Day Afternoon and has a nervous, edgy energy that keeps you on your toes."
10167,1,"The urgent docu-style filming is impressive, but it's Pattinson's fearless turn that lingers."
10168,1,"It's a sly and vivid dispatch from the struggling margins of Trump's America. And it's Robert Pattinson on peak form, giving a performance of desperate ferocity and trapped intensity."
10169,1,"The Safdies' raw documentary aesthetic transforms the film into a tense, uncomfortable exposé of desperate, damaged people unsuccessfully trying to bend the world to their own will."
10170,1,"The Safdie brothers' crime thriller Good Time is a chaotic, wildly inventive but increasingly self-indulgent affair."
10171,1,"Robert Pattinson finally drives a stake through his image as the moony hunk from Twilight with this convincing, career-shifting performance - his finest to date."
10172,1,"Few of the characters have the first idea what might be coming next - nor do we, strapped into this feral shaggy dog story the Safdies have set rolling, hurtling towards their brilliant future."
10173,1,"Pattinson plays a blinder in this gripping, gritty grindhouse-meets-arthouse heist movie."
10174,1,An intoxicating downer odyssey.
10175,1,"In watching Good Time, you forget that actor Robert Pattinson was ever involved with the Twilight franchise with what is the best performance of his career."
10176,1,It is certainly a good time to be Robert Pattinson. It's hard to think of another young actor who has moved so far - and so fast - away from the long shadow cast by his breakthrough role.
10177,1,"Robert Pattinson finally shakes off that Twilight shame with this tense, foul-mouthed and ironically-titled character/crime drama."
10178,1,Good Time follows in the footsteps of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets. The action keeps up a relentless pace as new characters are introduced.
10179,1,"It's intriguing, bold, exciting, fresh and urgent ... The first twenty minutes or so are staggering ... The original score, by Oneohtrix Point Never, is creepy, evocative and the best of the year thus far."
10180,1,Electricity pulses through the film - amped by Daniel Lopatin's grand slabs of retro-futurist synth - which also recalls the inventiveness and physicality of silent cinema comics like Buster Keaton.
10181,1,... Good Time always leaves just enough room between the dramatics for the characters to reveal their humanity.
10182,1,"Getting big stars on screen and giving them such dark, meaty roles has amply paid off."
10183,1,How good is Pattinson here? Scary good. De-Niro-in-the-1970s-good.
10184,1,Good Time isn't just nerve-wracking because Connie's scattershot schemes keep blowing up in his face; it keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering how the Safdies even got this footage.
10185,1,It's to Pattinson's credit that you slowly start to realise that Nick's absolute belief in Connie is an ongoing act of affirmation that the latter needs. Connie's love is laced with self-interest.
10186,1,"An enjoyably grimy, 80s-infused, Queens-set crime thriller about a bank robber busting his gut to free his incarcerated brother."
10187,1,"The film never lets up, pushing and pushing and pushing the viewer into Connie's deeply messed up world."
10188,1,"But this isn't Edward Cullen; this is Connie Nikas. He's the manipulative, selfish, absolutely electric antagonist of a movie that will bury itself under my skin just as much as that one scene did."
10189,1,At the heart of this off-balance heist movie is a story of brotherly love.
10190,1,"Often challenging and uncomfortable to watch, the ironically titled Good Time is a feverish head trip that seizes you by the throat and refuses to let go."
10191,1,"It is not just a Good Time for Pattinson, but a perfect moment for genre and movie stars (and directors like the Safdies) to explore new possibilities."
10192,1,Forget Twilight and Kristin Stewart romance rigamarole. Those days are done. Pattinson's take on a Queens dirtbag with an adrenal gland on overload proves he's the real deal.
10193,1,"Good Time is thrillingly alive, both hard to look at but impossible to turn away from."
10194,1,One of the best films of 2017.
10195,1,A distinctive head rush that pairs a handful of refreshingly earnest performances with a great sense of style.
10196,1,The Menu perfectly and sharply captures the milieu of this fine dining world with a scathing takedown of the condescension and pretension that fuels it.
10197,1,Black satire skewers the world of haute cuisine.
10198,1,"With splashes of horror and comedy, The Menu explores the world of fine dining restaurants. The movie has a stellar cast, including Fiennes and Taylor-Joy, who are incredible and magnetic together."
10199,1,The Menu delivers an engaging time and will leave the audience with a tantalizing sardonic meal.
10200,0,"...when the writers found themselves in a difficult plot situation, they resorted to the cheat of some sort of magical powers the Chef can weld with a whisper. Each time such a moment happens, the film begins to lose its grip on the reality of horror."
10201,1,"The Menu is a perfectly cooked, deliciously evil delight of a film that definitely won't be to everyone's tastes, but if it's your sort of dish at all, you're all but guaranteed to love every minute of it."
10202,0,"This gastronomic experience leaves no space for its comedic quips or food for thought, leaving way too much to be desired."
10203,1,"In a unique pairing with the palpable tension comes the dark humor of the film— two facets that usually do not go hand in hand in film as laughter famously diffuses any built up tension, but The Menu cooks up a balance that really works."
10204,1,“The Menu” is best explained by Hong Chau’s Elsa when she whispers to one of the guests during dinner: “You’ll eat less than you desire and more than you deserve.”
10205,1,A delicious satire that bites right into any industry that people obsess over. A haunting watch but one that will have you laughing & completely in love with the script.
10206,1,"The Menu deserves to be seen with very little knowledge of the plot. Even the trailers (and likely this review) give too much away. It’s a dark, vicious satire that expertly unfolds itself over the course of ten dishes."
10207,1,A very clean and well-performed movie that lets you get entirely immersed in it with zero distractions from its narrative and its purpose.
10208,1,stylish and engrossing and sadistically enjoyable
10209,1,The art of the meal and the consumer’s craving for more more s’more are just two of the topics explored in a far tastier “eat the rich” offering than the overcooked Triangle of Sadness.
10210,1,Never the thought and vision of a cheeseburger made such an impression on me. And by this time your appetite should be big for both the food and the movie.
10211,1,"The story, penned by Will Tracy and Seth Reiss, is expertly paced, punctuated by gorgeous title cards announcing the dishes."
10212,0,"Bad pretentious art that thinks it's critiquing bad pretentious art, told exclusively through the medium of food metaphors? ...yay."
10213,1,"It’s a slow-building revelation that will result in a gasp, and then it just builds on the “out there” abilities of a thriller/horror hybrid. Come for Ralph Fiennes, but stay for the outrageously bizarre finale."
10214,1,"As horror-satire goes, The Menu isn’t especially sophisticated. And true foodies can probably poke holes in every course. But in its own insistently odd way, the film is a good deal of palate-cleansing fun."
10215,1,"Finally, we have the definitive proof that American cheese on a burger is good."
10216,1,"Mark Mylod brings a healthy balance of entertainment and satire to his audience, accented by delicious performances from a cast of characters that make us question what a fine dining experience should look like."
10217,1,"Dark, wry, scathing, and utterly riveting, The Menu serves a deliciously twisted treat."
10218,1,"Both 'Glass Onion' and 'The Menu' owe some of their success and much of our enjoyment to the late, great Lady Mallowan. We are deep into Agatha Christie territory here."
10219,1,"It's a movie that I was enjoying with each bite as it was going along, because it's not just about culinary obsession...but it's a damning criticism of how we consume art."
10220,1,"Its critical view of the economic elite is one that Cinema, as a politically dynamic Art, reflects with increasing frequency in a reality in which social inequalities become greater and greater. [Full review in Portuguese]"
10221,1,".... ""The Menu"" is a delicious treat from appetizer to dessert, balancing the sweet and savory to offer a unique experience that ultimately reminds audiences not to f*** with the people who serve you."
10222,0,"The Menu starts off intriguing, but eventually gets too bogged down becoming the very thing it’s spoofing."
10223,0,"Mylod has some fun with it, and Fiennes does some delicious work. But its eat the rich allegories are half-baked at best."
10224,1,"Splicing horror and comedy with skill and delight, the movie is a satire of class, privilege, and pretension that's also at its core a supremely entertaining story."
10225,1,"... A genuinely hilarious send-up of everything in the world of art, from those who create to those who consume. While this isn’t unique subject matter, the way that the plot unfolds is."
10226,0,"Little by little, its plot loses its intriguing effect and ends up becoming a tasteless dish. [Full review in Spanish]"
10227,1,"This is a brilliant and intricate understanding of how art is the root of culture, and when there is no other purpose left for it, the artist resorts to self-immolation for the survival of creation."
10228,1,"Pretty enjoyable on its own terms, and as long as you don't need it to be too precise in its satiric aims."
10229,1,A wickedly delicious satire of fine dining obsession.
10230,0,"Neither fun nor scathing, funny nor insightful, the film coasts on second-rate quips and third-rate violence."
10231,1,"This sinister, satirical dark comedy is undoubtedly one of the most bizarrely absurd thrillers of the year, skewering pretentious 'foodies' and the 'fine dining' they crave."
10232,1,"Led by Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Fiennes, the film explores classism and wealth through the performative lens of food and nostalgia."
10233,1,Anya Taylor-Joy anchors a wickedly entertaining satire.
10234,1,"The ""eat the rich"" movie of the year."
10235,1,"A tingling black comedy awash with thrills, wit, and well-earned heartburn. Reaching for the Tums has never been so much fun."
10236,1,"A competently prepared dish that would like to be thought of, ultimately, as a well-made cheeseburger."
10237,1,"The visually intimate and beautiful set, slowly turns into a claustrophobic and horrifying space. This is definitely worth the price of admission! Just remember to tip your waiter."
10238,1,"The Menu is thematically untidy and slightly underdeveloped in spots, rendering it merely good instead of great. Otherwise, it’s a pointedly absurd, consistently funny and suspenseful chamber-piece thriller with strong performances and a sharp edge."
10239,1,"The Menu is an interesting look at class structure, a cultish devotion to art and a deconstruction of pretentiousness in today's society.   Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy do an incredible job."
10240,1,"The Menu is just out there, its violent, intentionally creepy, dark, and at times horrifically comedic and I truly loved every minute of it. With a great cast, very interesting concept for the script & devotion to the characters is always felt. A MUST SEE"
10241,1,"It’s here we begin to see The Menu as a story about class and inequality, which swiftly translates into a reign of terror inflicted by the serfs on their social superiors."
10242,1,Director Mark Mylod lays on the dark comedy as thick as a creamy garlic aioli in this tasty thriller.
10243,1,"The very definition of a slow-burn thriller... (like) the soft ticking of a kitchen timer teasing the cooking meal to come, waiting as the air fills with an aroma thick enough to already taste."
10244,1,"THE MENU is a dark star of a satire with ornate dishes that are full of self-loathing and human frailty. It lovingly catalogs the artist’s attempt to share the contents of their soul with people who understand. THE MENU is refined, precise, and deadly."
10245,1,"Mylod  believes satire is a dish best served cold. But not when it’s this icy. It requires a modicum of warmth. And without it, “The Menu” struggles to pass the taste test. Still, try it, you might like it. But don’t forget the Alka Seltzer."
10246,1,"Even if the film’s social commentary and satirical edge feels like a badly-tossed salad of ideas, its controlled directing, quick pacing, and fantastic performances provide some flavorful textures and cinematic bites."
10247,1,"The third act proves somewhat rushed and messy, the joke finding its limits with apparently nowhere to go. Thankfully, however, Mylod and company do stick the landing, pivoting back to cold, calculating finality."
10248,1,"The actors make it work—among them, Hong Chau as the devoted maitre’d refusing people bread..."
10249,1,"The Menu is not what you would call good family fun, but it could be fun to watch this Thanksgiving with a particularly perverse family."
10250,1,"The Menu could have done with slightly more nuance, but it’s a gripping black comedy that grills its characters to perfection."
10251,1,"Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy are sensational in this punctual satire that surprises us dish after dish, down to the last bite. [Full Review in Spanish]"
10252,1,"The Menu is a well-made and fun horror-satire that smartly dabbles in class, wealth, and criticism, featuring a good, strong cast."
10253,1,"The film fares better as a tightly constructed exercise in horror, like a cross between the mechanized death of a Saw movie and the eat-the-rich grotesquerie of Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover."
10254,1,"While it's a tad overlong, I greatly enjoyed this. It was interesting, thought provoking and as an artist, I greatly connected with the motives behind the event."
10255,1,I greatly enjoyed this entertaining thriller that wasn't as graphic as I thought it would be. The fact that the actors all bought into the concept and executed at 100% made it even more entertaining.
10256,1,"Clever and creepy, this satire skewers the elite and plays well into other similar films."
10257,1,"While “The Menu” isn’t as clever as “Knives Out,” it does manage to deflate pretense and show just how equal everyone is in a tense situation. It’s funny, but it’s deadly serious. Don’t go with a full stomach and be sure to try the popcorn."
10258,1,"As much as I liked it... at the end of the day, it's not quite as smart as it thinks it is."
10259,1,"A different That Shelf take on Mark Mylod’s THE MENU, an edgy black comedy that elevates the angry satire and tickles the audience in a hilariously ingenious way."
10260,1,"The Menu is simultaneously as understated as a pinch of salt and as subtle as a ghost pepper. This is a black comedy wearing the guise of a horror movie or a thriller, and it is better when it embraces the comedy elements."
10261,1,Confusing plot elevated by superb acting all way round.
10262,0,"The comedy elements run toward heavy-handed absurdity, and the thrills are telegraphed too early and often."
10263,0,An over seasoned satirical thriller from producers Adam McKay and Will Ferrell bites off a little more than it can chew.
10264,1,"The Menu is an atmospheric, claustrophobic thriller with a killer ending, but manages to fall short in serving up a full-course of deranged delights."
10265,1,"The satire may be delivered with the subtlety of a rolling pin, but The Menu is never less than entertaining thanks to sizzling performances from a steely-eyed Fiennes, sycophantic Hoult and sleazy Leguizamo."
10266,1,"…exactly the blast of populist, adult orientated entertainment that the big screen has been sorely lacking of late…"
10267,1,"A top-notch exploration of the toxic relationship between art, artist and consumer. Sharp satire, commentary with precise cuts, and tantalizing tension that brings the heat."
10268,1,"A black comedy that perhaps could have been a little more ambitious -or less obvious in its ambitions-, but like any good plate of food, can be enjoyed without problems. Full review in Spanish."
10269,1,"Slowik’s slow-cooked revenge against social inequality, bad taste, cruel critique, culinary pretension and even ‘fast food’ cinema is unsettling and accusatory."
10270,1,"From amuse bouch to dessert, this thriller earns its stripes in satirizing pretensions."
10271,1,"As with food, sometimes simple is best and with the right ingredients, you can serve up a sumptuous dish - The Menu is a deliciously dark comedy with some devilish horror beats thrown in for good measure, it's a real treat."
10272,1,"Some may quibble with the film's direct approach, but what The Menu lacks in subtlety it more than makes up for with scathing satire and a trio of exceptional performances from Fiennes, Taylor-Joy and Chau."
10273,0,"It’s easy to point and laugh at the rich, or feel a sense of vindication... But you still walk away feeling hungry."
10274,1,A delightfully despicable B-horror comedy disguised as an artsy meditation on creation and commerce.
10275,1,"A savage, savvy and scathingly amusing satire about coveting $1250-a-head meals but letting the workers behind them slice, steam, stir and sweat through upscale kitchen drudgery."
10276,1,"Stylishly photographed by Peter Deming, The Menu becomes increasingly creepy with each new course."
10277,0,I think it all gets squandered by trying to shovel it into satire.
10278,1,"I don't think I necessarily felt satisfied by the climax of this film, but it's a very stylish affair. I very much enjoyed being in the world it's set in. It left me hungry for more, I guess."
10279,0,"Like the appetizers, entrees, and apertifs so lovingly filmed here, The Menu is a fetish object styled as an indulgent antidote to unearned pretension, one meant to be appreciated, not to be enjoyed."
10280,1,"With limited depth, but effervescent. [Full review in Spanish]"
10281,1,An intelligent dilemma that portents to be more scandalous than what it actually serves; The Menu is an agile ode to the inherent beauty of a pretentious dish while simultaneously questioning its existence. [Full review in Spanish]
10282,1,"The marvelous, multitalented Ralph Fiennes is the best thing on the menu in this clever culinary delight."
10283,1,Anya Taylor-Joy and Nicholas Hoult prove to be more irresistible together than apart... [Full review in Spanish]
10284,1,...a slow-burn endeavor that admittedly (and effectively) captures the viewer’s interest right from the get-go...
10285,1,The Menu is a twisted horror film that’s a delectable experience and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
10286,1,"In a continuing series of 2022 films destroying the rich this clever, cheeky horror-comedy is a real delight. The only thing difficult in recommending it is trying to avoid the cliched food adjectives to describe it. All of which apply."
10287,1,"While the movie can lack believability and doesn’t always push things as far as it could, this is an exquisitely crafted film with a sense of humor that lingers throughout the entire movie"
10288,1,"I feel like if you like a good thriller... you'll enjoy yourself, but if you're you're a foodie who likes fine cuisine and also you happen to like a thriller, this movie was made for you."
10289,1,There’s no romantic spark between Fiennes and Taylor-Joy. There’s something better. Both actors have unfettered access to their inner villains.
10290,1,The Menu serves up a ghoulish and madly entertaining two hours of prime cinema.
10291,1,"Foodie culture is slayed, literally, in this expert black comedy."
10292,1,"Entertaining and slight. It's an amuse-bouche, not the whole meal."
10293,0,It looked and felt and seemed a lot better than it really is.
10294,1,"Mark Mylod has shown a talent for skewering the wealthy and the pretentious on Succession, and this is a more obvious flambeing and with tongue planted much more firmly in the cheek."
10295,1,"A delectable cinematic treat, one that’s consistently smart, funny and engaging."
10296,1,The film simply has an attractive charm about it that pulls you in and keeps you interested.
10297,1,"Richard Curtis’ Love Actually claims the prize of being the “ultimate romantic comedy” not through daring or originality, but by covering every cliché imaginable offered by the genre, and doing so with style."
10298,1,"...while Curtis clearly connects more with some stories than others, the best bits are genuinely classics..."
10299,0,"The work is lopsided and misshapen, not like life, but a poor, contrived, somewhat disoriented impression of life."
10300,0,"A load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish."
10301,1,It's almost a shock to see such a well constructed and beautifully acted scene (Emma Thompson opening her present) amid the rest of this film's more mainstream machinations.
10302,1,A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand.
10303,1,It's a tremendous romantic comedy that far outshines most American comedies.
10304,1,"Curtis pulls off a spectacular feat of screenwriting, expertly defining 16 principal characters and their relationships, providing each one with a beginning, middle, and end, and making us care about what happens to all of them."
10305,1,There's so much right and yummy about this multi-tiered plum cake of a romantic comedy.
10306,0,"The film exhibits a real soft spot for sexual predators, while also promoting the notion that Christmas is the perfect time to publicly dump your love on the near-stranger you're tenderly stalking."
10307,1,"Now, though, Curtis, England's most successful comic screenwriter, has shown that when it comes to Hollywood pap, the English can teach Hollywood a treacly trick or two."
10308,1,This plum pudding of a romantic comedy is rich with delicious moments.
10309,0,Love Actually isn't in love with anyone except itself: it's like watching a practised lounge lizard go through his repertoire.
10310,1,"Forget about stiff upper lips. Though very British, this irresistible ensemble comedy will easily coax full-sized grins of enjoyment from viewers."
10311,0,"If you feel yourself glowing after Love Actually, you might be suffering from sugar shock."
10312,1,"Out of the cacophony of other, newly minted love affairs that promise eternal love forever and ever, theirs stand out like a winter fern among hothouse roses, adding a much-needed zest to the bouquet."
10313,1,Love Actually provides enough happy endings to make the audience forget that romance and Christmas miracles don't always work out.
10314,0,"The tagline for Love Actually is ""The Ultimate Romantic Comedy."" Perhaps. But not in the sense the producers intended."
10315,0,[T]here's more authentic sentiment in a Hallmark card than in the entire movie.
10316,1,"It is not only the best romantic comedy in quite a long time, it is every romantic comedy in quite a long time, baked into a melange and made gargantuan. I left smiling like a huge imbecile."
10317,1,"A polished, fluid production with impeccable technical credits and a winning soundtrack, Love Actually is the very definition of entertainment and is guaranteed to bring joy to the world this Christmas."
10318,1,"As far as frothy, feelgood stuff goes, Love Actually works on most levels."
10319,0,"[E]ven the best eggnogs can turn sour, and the mistaken addition of paprika in place of nutmeg can transform what should be a treat into something see."
10320,0,"There is enough love to go around, but I am not sure this movie does a good job of spreading it."
10321,1,"Sit back, and gawp at Ideal Britain. Revel in the tipsy plot. And enjoy a film full of adult whimsy and adolescent whingeing."
10322,1,"A trim here, a tuck there, a couple of extraneous characters being shown the cutting-room floor and ""Love Actually"" might actually have emerged as a genuine, warmhearted holiday classic."
10323,0,"That could have been a fascinating theme, but Mr. Curtis's film has no attitude about it other than blind approval."
10324,0,The resulting film really is disheartening. [Full Review in Spanish]
10325,1,Some of the stories this film tells really hook you in. [Full Review in Spanish]
10326,1,"Does get very, very mushy at times, but the overall excellence of a stellar ensemble (Liam Neeson, Emma Thompson and Laura Linney) more than compensates."
10327,1,"Love Actually is alternately beguiling and bloated, witty and warmed over, smart and pandering. The majority is likely to swoon."
10328,1,"As I've said, it's not entirely rinsed free of schmalz but 14 years on, it still works. Happy Christmas."
10329,1,"Aside from all the hearts and flowers, though, it's Bill Nighy's uproarious turn as an over-the-hill rocker promoting a novelty record that really delivers the laughs."
10330,0,Seldom have we seen such an extensive ensemble of talent in the movies yanked through the material like lambs on their way to a slaughter.
10331,0,"Love? Actually, no. More like disappointment, and, at times, hatred."
10332,0,"A long running time, too many characters and too much whimsy and corn make this romantic romp more of a slog than a soufflé."
10333,1,Romantic and entertaining -- for older teens.
10334,1,"Bombastic audience-hooting moments aside, Curtis has written his most accomplished film, finding the energy to direct the hell out of it as well. And it's even gloriously R-rated to boot."
10335,1,"Despite it's naivety, this is one of the most beautiful and heart warming movies to come around in years..."
10336,1,"Loads of fun as long as your expectations aren't overly raised by the hype, the cast and the taglines."
10337,0,"Transfixed by the taboos of the...British class system, Curtis seems to think that nothing could be more erotic than the subordinate who fetches tea or dusts the crockery."
10338,0,For the cuddlers out there who like things a little too light and fluffy.
10339,0,Disconcertingly lubricious.
10340,1,"This is cloying, deceitful, and more or less irresistible."
10341,1,"Without ever sounding a false note, this endearing ensemble holiday flick manages to be nuttier than Notting Hill, more satisfying than Bridget Jones' Diary, and even more intricate than Four Weddings and a Funeral."
10342,1,It's a perfectly respectable debut for Curtis.
10343,1,Plenty of entertainment in this well acted ensemble comedy that Robert Altman could easily have put his name on.
10344,0,"This is an embarrassment, an overdrawn rom-com gone very wrong."
10345,1,The film lives up to its hype.
10346,1,"Packed with plenty of laughs and even a few tearjerker moments, Love Actually is not only a great movie for Christmas time, but just about any time of the year."
10347,1,"Curtis has created a joyful, entertaining date movie that'll leave you with a smile on your face and an almost irresistible urge to hug somebody."
10348,0,This is definitely a case of a writer-turned-director that is too in love with his own script to make hard choices about what to keep and what to cut.
10349,0,Funny? Maybe. Not to me.
10350,1,"Curtis has lost none of his touch, though the ending is somewhat muddled and 135 minutes is very long, even for a good romantic comedy."
10351,0,A highly engineered puffball.
10352,0,"A charming little film that, unfortunately, gets carried away with itself and never quite makes the grade."
10353,1,It's tart and amusing but carries a slightly cloying aftertaste.
10354,0,"My problem is an acute allergy to repitition. Love, Actually and other champions of the romantic-comedy flyweight division make me break out in hives."
10355,1,Ten romantic comedies rolled into one.
10356,0,"In the end the film is just as winsome and sugary as its facile message: ""love, actually, is all around."""
10357,0,"It wants to swirl round the world and find love in every cranny, but it doesn't have the effortless rush of energy that it would need to make the masses of plot come together."
10358,0,One character goes on about the 'total agony' of being in love. That's nothing compared to the agony of watching these people in the agonies of love.
10359,0,"While the movie is occasionally charming, the soufflé falls flat in the end ..."
10360,1,"Impressive, if self-indulgent directing debut."
10361,1,"Upon first viewing, it is something of a guilty pleasure. Upon second viewing, it is simply a pleasure."
10362,0,This kind of comedy has just hit the wall.
10363,0,There's simply too much here to digest.
10364,0,"Screenwriter Richard Curtis tries to direct, puts too many eggs in his basket, and winds up with a very runny omelette."
10365,0,Curtis repeats and reiterates these themes to the point that it's just as redundant as saying that someone repeats and reiterates in the same statement.
10366,1,"'Encantadora, romántica y mágica, es una de esa cintas que cualquiera que aún crea en la bondad humana y en lo hermoso de las relaciones personales va a disfrutar como nadie'"
10367,1,"Love Actually is cheerful and undeniably romantic and, despite its flaws, you'd be hard-pressed to sit through the credits without smiling."
10368,0,Sitting through 128 minutes of this much aggressive charm and wit is like being mugged in slow motion by beautiful people from the pages of Vanity Fair.
10369,1,"All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie until, in the end, it went somewhat bonkers with what amounted to a communal love fest on Christmas Eve."
10370,1,Whatever the actors are given to do they make so delightful -- or so delightfully moving -- that Love Actually wins out over its wobbles.
10371,1,The year's busiest and most relentlessly shameless comedy. It's also among the year's funniest and most disarming.
10372,1,"Jamais deixa de ser envolvente, já que Curtis, um escritor experiente, é hábil na construção das histórias, que são recheadas com seu humor tipicamente britânico."
10373,1,It tries to cover all aspects of love and succeeds far better than you would expect it to.
10374,1,"There's good acting in Love Actually, but director Richard Curtis threatens to take the cool out of London."
10375,1,Richard Curtis is so earnest ... that what otherwise might seem overly sentimental and cloying comes across as genuinely touching
10376,0,"Peppered with so many moments of raw, affecting honesty that it's intensely difficult to dislike -- and tempting to forgive Richard Curtis for not finishing what he starts,"
10377,1,"For all my reservations about Love Actually, I found it amusing and sweet."
10378,0,"Classy, so long as you approach it without thought, basic narrative understanding, and resistance to unearned sentiment."
10379,1,You'll laugh! You'll cry! And you'll go home feeling ever so slightly used...
10380,0,'Why make one good romantic comedy when you can make nine bad ones?'
10381,1,I'll take an overly sentimental movie over a sardonic one any day - particularly around the holidays. Now if I only Santa would tuck Hugh under my Christmas tree.
10382,1,"This movie contains everything except Bridget Jones, actually."
10383,1,"[Curtis'] sheer glee is infectious. He's playing us like fiddles, we know he's playing us like fiddles, and he knows that we know, and everyone loves it."
10384,1,"When a situation becomes intriguing, writer-director Curtis develops ADD and shifts focus. Fortunately, the cast and Curtis' eye for absurdly comic situations wins out."
10385,1,"Like the holiday season itself, the movie overwhelms you, but in an agreeable way."
10386,1,"Go, you weapy-eyed romantics. It's too long but mostly fun, actually."
10387,1,"Directorial debut of Brit-com master Richard Curtis is a big, bright ensemble tale with many delights -- and absolutely no surprises."
10388,1,"An utterly charming, classy and uproarious work of romantic hopefulness."
10389,1,"Love, Actually"" is a bit sluggish at times, the film's good nature and wit grows on you."
10390,1,"Richard Curtis has, with this 4th Working Title chick flick, possibly ruined it for all men by just getting what women want in an onscreen man, - we're not complaining."
10391,1,"Warm, bittersweet and hilarious, this is lovely, actually. Prepare to be smitten."
10392,0,"The hollowness of the stories that lie behind each of these shameless heart-grabbers, laugh-getters and tear-jerkers becomes quickly apparent."
10393,0,There were times watching this movie when I felt I was being force-fed 30 pounds of crème brûlée.
10394,1,... a terrific film.
10395,1,"Runs long and gets silly at times, but it is not embarrassed to be a simple, happy film that affirms life and love."
10396,1,A visually inventive and thought-provoking continuation of the latest franchise reboot...
10397,1,It does justice to this central character who we’ve spent so much time with and genuinely care about.
10398,0,"War for the Planet of the Apes squanders its actors, FX, and formal presentation on a story that feels lazily compiled from other material, marking a bitter end for Caesar and this otherwise admirable trilogy."
10399,1,"""War for the Planet of Apes"" is a full-bodied epic of glory and pain that matches and then exceeds the moving importance and heart this rebooted franchise has established in two previous knockout films."
10400,1,The best entry in the rebooted series and might be the best film in the entire saga. It's a genuinely risky and powerfully adult tale told with the biggest canvas possible.
10401,1,War for the Planet of the Apes follows Spider-Man: Homecoming as an example of how to allow a franchise to continue to expand and breathe rather than trying to keep it mired in by-the-numbers numbness.
10402,1,'War' narrows a global conflict into a personal drama of blood revenge and blind belief that continually ratchets up the tension until one gigantic and cathartic release spills forth onto the screen.
10403,1,"By referencing the Vietnam War and modern-day conflicts, this franchise-boosting epic apes a number of classic movies."
10404,1,"Great effects, great performances. [Full review in Spanish]"
10405,1,The third film of Fox's new Apes films is the brilliant culmination of what this series has been driving toward.
10406,1,Proficiency in computer imagery has reached such an astounding degree of realism that the digitally synthesized simians here truly come alive onscreen.
10407,1,"Don't discredit this Apes trilogy as a standard Hollywood remakes. The conclusion is epic, thought provoking, and proves its light years ahead of the old Heston films."
10408,1,At its worst it continues to be an immensely entertaining and substantial summer action flick.
10409,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is not only a poignant film but also the most satisfying conclusion to a trilogy in a long time.
10410,1,I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I needed to know the full story of Caesar and make sure that him and his tribe would be safe. [Full review in Spanish]
10411,1,War for the Planet of the Apes proves a moving saga and provides a satisfying closing chapter to what's become one of cinema's best blockbuster trilogies.
10412,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes is an emotional end to a fantastic journey. It's not your average summer blockbuster, and that's what makes it nearly perfect."
10413,1,"There's a depth here that most big-budget films simply don't even aspire to, let alone achieve. And if the visual effects team doesn't take home the Oscar, nothing should."
10414,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes is a great film, and it's the end of one of the best science fiction trilogies made in years."
10415,1,"Have you ever dreamed of a world where you could see The Bridge Over the River Kwai, Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, The Great Escape, and The Ten Commandments remade with gorillas, monkeys, and orangutans?... We finally live in that world."
10416,1,podcast review
10417,1,The motion-captured apes look amazingly real and convincing.
10418,1,"Emotional, action-packed and beautifully shot, War for the Planet of the Apes delivers something that some film franchises have failed - a brilliant threequel."
10419,1,A great closure to a great trilogy that made us all believe again in this wonderful premise. [Full review in Spanish].
10420,1,"Putting aside the flaws, this is a satisfying end to Caesar's trilogy, there's a feeling of finality throughout the film, kept together by some killer performances, top notch visuals, and tension-heavy scenes."
10421,1,This is a well constructed film with good pacing and understandable motivations.
10422,1,This is the third sequel all franchises should aim to have in their filmography. War for the Planet of the Apes is one of the most sincere and one of the most human films to experience from 2017. Andy Serkis is a monkey god among men.
10423,1,It's nothing short of astonishing.
10424,1,A film that groans for grace amid the brutality of a dog-eat-dog world.
10425,1,"Its sensibility, its sense of the spectacle, its complex characters and the impeccable work of the director Matt Reeves are only factors in an equation that combines art and entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
10426,1,"The vehicle may be pretty, but it's still just spinning its wheels."
10427,1,"Serkis' performance is what gives the film its humanity - we actually care about these computer generated apes, because Serkis and the rest of the cast imbue them with such soulful realism."
10428,1,"The focussed nature of its vision is impressive but as the film marches, the slightness of its story moves from deliberate precision to repetitiveness."
10429,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is an extremely satisfying conclusion to one of the best trilogies that has come out in recent years.
10430,1,One of my favorite films so far this summer.
10431,1,Director Matt Reeves and his team should be very proud of what they have accomplished with this film.
10432,1,A thundering end to a powerful trilogy.
10433,1,"The film successfully delivers nuanced ape characters, without ever feeling artificial."
10434,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes firmly cements this franchise's status as the smartest, most thoughtful blockbuster action series going."
10435,1,"It's relatable. It's affecting. And it's deeply moving. For a film about a bunch of talking apes, that's a triumph in itself."
10436,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is exhilarating and melds together an expert level of craft and performance that shores itself up as one of the delights of this Summer
10437,1,"The three films (stand) consistently as a strong trilogy, and in my mind, ... one of the strongest. Often, quality slips with each entry, but (these) get stronger as they go."
10438,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is the biblical epic for our time...
10439,1,An epic conclusion to an epic trilogy that fully cements Serkis as the best motion capture performer for now and forever.
10440,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is an emotional yet thrilling ride that will leave audiences satisfied with how this chapter closes.
10441,1,"Prove[s] emphatically that you can make a big FX-driven blockbuster that will entertain crowds but also tell a smart, compelling story full of complex characters and interesting, thoughtful ideas."
10442,1,This series of films hangs entirely on the shoulders of a fully formed digital character. It's a remarkable bet... and resulted in what is pound for pound perhaps the best modern trilogy since the Lord Of the Rings.
10443,1,"As Caesar, Andy Serkis delivers in ways that make the Academy's refusal to acknowledge his work all the more embarrassing."
10444,1,"[Matt] Reeves' fandom since childhood for the franchise is evident in every frame of his Apes pictures. This is a grim story of loss and hate and revenge, told against the even-grimmer backdrop of the literal end of the human race."
10445,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes does a fantastic job of rebuking toxic masculinity and centering nonverbal communication, but it forgets to lift up women or people of color in its ambitious goals."
10446,1,"Whilst War for the Planet of the Apes' title may be somewhat misleading, the film itself is anything but a letdown."
10447,1,It makes the fall of humanity an engaging spectacle. And now I openly welcome our new ape overlords.
10448,0,"There is inelegance here between expression and meaning that is jarring, and makes this a grim watch at times."
10449,1,"The end result isn't quite as effective as Dawn before it, but War delivers the emotional heft to bring the trilogy full circle. Can we give Serkis an Oscar nomination yet?"
10450,1,"As simians and Homo sapiens touch base with their lowest, the Planet of the Apes' prequel series reaches its peak in quality."
10451,1,"A chillingly daring finale that swings through the vines, leaps, and sticks the landing, providing a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy."
10452,1,What could have just been a title-grab sequel is instead a genuinely moving experience.
10453,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes builds on a central tenet - ""apes together strong"" - and sends out resonating values that we can all learn something from."
10454,1,"Andy Serkis' Cesar is incredibly spot on, the strong core of this morality play versus Woody Harrelson's Colonel, the embodiment of human evil."
10455,1,Go apes!
10456,1,"I was captivated from the start, and remained awed throughout. It seems the third time's the charm for this latter-day reboot of the Apes franchise. It's consummately grand and original."
10457,1,"An eerily symbolic narrative that fuses multiple genres (prison film, melodrama) with deeply political subtext about hate and isolation."
10458,1,Never has Caesar been better developed and searched than in this film.
10459,1,You cannot help but root for Caesar as much as you cannot shake the feeling that in the gamut of life and evolution humans may not deserve to be saved.
10460,1,"Despite its 2.5 hour run-time, it never feels dull, with a constant complex yet natural progression."
10461,1,It's what sets great science fiction apart from another Michael Bay Transformers movie: decisions having real benefits and consequences that may not be readily apparent.
10462,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes is definitely the most fable-like movie in the rebooted Apes trilogy, with its starkly defined war of good apes against evil humans. But it's also the most character-driven story too."
10463,1,"Having the technology to capture said performances is extremely gratifying, as War for the Planet of the Apes gives a legitimacy to a season otherwise known for less intelligent films."
10464,1,"This is that rare film capable of holding even the most boisterous and fidgety of audiences in stunned silence, all the more impressive when it's while a room full of CGI apes are communicating via sign language. That is cinema."
10465,1,Do not miss this visually impressive film. [Full review in Spanish]
10466,1,"A blockbuster adventure that combines epic spectacle, moral complexity and surprising emotional depth."
10467,1,"I really enjoyed it as I walked out, and it's only gotten better as I thought about it and slept on it."
10468,1,"Visually gratifying and epic in scope, it's a memorable conclusion to a brilliant, re-imagined trilogy."
10469,1,The new Planet of the Apes series has been given a fitting and powerful conclusion.
10470,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is a thrilling end to a groundbreaking trilogy.
10471,1,It has the freshness of a story that you're hearing for the first time.
10472,1,Does not disappoint. [Full review in Spanish]
10473,1,... a memorable piece of modern big budget filmmaking.
10474,0,I found the machinations tedious - the film is more than two hours long - and there isn't much tension regarding the eventual outcome.
10475,1,Reeves combines the feel of a war movie like Apocalypse Now or Platoon with the flashy special effects you find in most summer movies. This gives us a rare Hollywood blockbuster that is as deep in story as it is dazzling to watch.
10476,1,Who'd have predicted that the prequel to a 1968 movie about a planet of simians who speak like humans would become the most intelligent franchise of the new century?
10477,1,A fitting send-off to one of the best blockbuster trilogies in modern cinema.
10478,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes is poetic blockbuster storytelling, the kind we don't see enough of anymore. Director Matt Reeves continues to excel handling delicate subject material"
10479,1,"War for the Planet of the Apes manages a deft balance between allusion, esotericism, and obviousness that in part explains the runaway success of the series."
10480,1,War for the Planet of the Apes brings the trilogy to an end with a fitting conclusion.
10481,0,"It tries to hold a mirror up to humanity, but merely provides a romp through a forest of empty signifiers."
10482,1,"Simply put, this study of humanity is phenomenal cinema."
10483,1,A stirring conclusion that features great special effects and another incredible performance from Andy Serkis.
10484,1,"The action, as in the previous films, is intense and the pacing is brisk, which isn't usually the case for a film almost 2 1/2 hours long. That being said, if this is the final film in the series it's going out on top. Hail Caesar!"
10485,1,"""Sequelitis"" is like the simian flu that's killing off the human population. It's easy to catch. But, director-co-writer Matt Reeves and writer Mark Bomback apparently got their flu shots."
10486,1,"Andy Serkis for another thundering performance. If you thought he was good as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films, then his superlative performance here will just blow your mind away."
10487,1,"While War pivots around the test of wills of the colonel and Caesar, the movie demonstrates a sense of humor, particularly with Steve Zahn's Bad Ape, who got his name by being admonished so often by humans."
10488,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film that balances action and special effects well enough to make it stand out from all the blockbusters seen so far this year.
10489,1,Reeves has made the closest thing to a silent movie that we will likely have in today's Hollywood zeitgeist
10490,1,"There's no doubt the end result here is impressive. But if Serkis does ever win anything, he'd be wise to make the visual-effects team first on his list of ""people to thank""."
10491,1,"Consistent with the latest generation of these Boulle-based films that started in 2011, it examines the question of who is bestial. Man or ape? It answers the question with an intelligence not often found in Hollywood blockbusters."
10492,1,War for the Planet of the Apes is concerned less with spectacle than it is with delving into how one defines humanity and what are the right paths to take in order to claim rightful equality.
10493,1,"These are movies about gorillas who ride horses that feel, at first blush, like kiddie fare. And yet, once you take the step to suspend your disbelief, this is one of the sharpest franchises about the human condition."
10494,1,"While it is dark in places, War rounds out one of the best trilogies out there."
10495,1,"Puts such a perfect period on the saga, not an ellipsis."
10496,1,Gabe Polsky’s adaptation of John Williams’ novel is driven by a fierce performance by Nicolas Cage as an Ahab-like hunter who’s intent on wiping out a herd of buffalo in a remote Colorado valley.
10497,1,"[Fred] Hechinger impresses as the fish out of water, but it's Cage's enigmatic steeliness that carries the film whenever the plot meanders in its attempt to deconstruct the mythology and morality of the Old West."
10498,1,Polsky’s script and cast can’t quite match the visual clarity he gives the tale.
10499,1,"Butcher’s Crossing is a decent western, with decent performances. It’s a film that delivers what’s expected.  But it could have been so much more."
10500,1,"…has a dark style and heart-breaking sense of hard-scrabble endurance that only a real adventure can provide, and that’s largely due to Cage’s magnetic presence…."
10501,1,"Butcher’s Crossing is a simple but solid Western with beautiful locations. Cage turns in another intriguing performance to go along with his recent output, even though Miller never quite pops as much as he should."
10502,0,The film doesn’t really know what it is or who it’s for.
10503,0,Butcher’s Crossing never fully completes the psychological factor it desperately needs to connect and meet the film’s weighty themes.
10504,1,"The man vs. nature and man vs. man themes come through in this respectable effort, but “Butcher’s Crossing” is a grim viewing experience."
10505,1,"This grim, pessimistic Western at times feels a little inert and uneven; it might have had more thrust, more madness, but it still captivates with its powerful visuals and fine performances."
10506,1,"Not at all action-packed, this is a compelling enough psychological journey that could have excelled further were it to really focus on what impact these men were having on land they did not cherish enough."
10507,0,"Polsky has great admiration for his source material and his cast, and fails them both through his attempt to give them too much dignity."
10508,1,"Fear, anxiety, and dread drive Gabe Polsky’s bleak drama which resembles the dark revisionist Westerns from the 70s and 80s, from the Eastwood films to the horror-tinged “The White Buffalo.” Solid cast with Cage delivering a low-key performance."
10509,1,"For the completists of Nicolas Cage -a captivating presence, as always- and those enamored with the natural world -vividly captured through beautiful photography- that can deal with the buffalo hunting sequences. [Full review in Spanish]"
10510,1,"The film’s hints of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Moby-Dick and The Old Man and the Sea lend some much-needed weight to what would otherwise be a pedestrian story of men fighting the elements and one another."
10511,1,"Butcher's Crossing is a solid film held back by a below average script. Buffalo hunting is the central plot, but the characters make the film shines."
10512,1,"Butcher's Crossing is a parable of greed, arrogance, and humanity's unquenchable thirst for blood. Good performances overcome uneven pacing. A solid second act emphasizes character development and lifts the film."
10513,1,Cage is welcomely understated in a performance that is all the more impressive for his avoiding his trademark excess.
10514,1,"Deconstructing mythology and morality in the Old West, this deliberately paced drama weaves its rugged frontier landscapes into a harrowing story about actions and consequences."
10515,0,"‘Butcher’s Crossing’ offers remarkable footage and an important message, but narratively, the film doesn’t quite make the cut."
10516,0,"“Butcher’s Crossing” is unfocused, distant, and flat."
10517,1,"It's not a rootin' tootin' Old West good time, but for Cage fans, this is an interesting enough look into the harsher elements of frontier life in a role that plays to the actor's strong suits."
10518,1,"Gabe Polsky's BUTCHER'S CROSSING is a familiarly harsh depiction of men going against nature with nothing but greed, vengeance, and hubris in their hearts."
10519,1,"The performances are authentic and nuanced, especially from Cage who is surprisingly (and effectively) restrained. And the stunning cinematography not only captures the natural beauty of the setting but also the remoteness of an untouched countryside."
10520,1,Nicolas Cage is not only riveting but also surprisingly restrained in the unsettling new western Butcher’s Crossing.
10521,1,"Butcher’s Crossing is not the freshest of Westerns, but it does offer some bleak and gnarly imagery, gorgeous vistas, and Nicolas Cage in a subtle but poignant performance."
10522,1,"A strong showcase for Cage, who delivers a powerful performance."
10523,1,"The narrative is simple and stretched out which can make it feel slow and repetitive, but the film is never dull or boring. The unique storytelling angle is what makes this an interesting addition to the Western genre."
10524,1,"“Butcher’s Crossing” is a tightly spun, well-acted, beautifully shot and unforgiving slice of Old West madness."
10525,0,"Butcher's Crossing can't muster much more than to point out that the legend of Old West isn't all that's cracked up to be, and at this point, that's not much of a point in the first place."
10526,1,It’s a mostly well-crafted film with decent visual scope. The film’s greatest flaws are in Cage’s shakily written character...
10527,0,"Though “Butcher’s” has its share of conflicts and drama, it can move as slowly as the glaciers that cut its imposing scenery."
10528,0,"While Polsky delivers some gorgeous vistas of the Montana shooting locations, he can't translate Williams' story into equally powerful drama."
10529,1,The film offers Cage a rarity for someone at this stage of his career; a new challenge in a new genre.
10530,1,"A slow-burn descent into insanity, and this strange balance of history and psychological horror keeps “Butcher’s Crossing” involving despite its grim premise."
10531,0,"Unfortunately, like the buffalo, the film just roams"
10532,0,"A B-western, but not particularly exciting or thrilling."
10533,1,"The big setting, big themes and big star’s subtle turn as a blowhard more misguided than manic are enough to put this Western over."
10534,1,"Bald and bearded, Cage is typically magnetic as the Ahab-like Miller, whose obsessive quest to slaughter a valley full of bison for their hides slowly drives everyone insane."
10535,0,"If its characters were more boldly drawn, Butcher’s Crossing could have been a major addition to the neo-western canon."
10536,1,"Uneven, but good enough to survive the hunt."
10537,1,A compelling film that brings to life a side of the cowboy genre not often explored.
10538,1,"Polsky’s film is clearly running up the clock in a way that makes me feel like there just wasn’t enough material to warrant a full-feature film, but features a fantastic, biting performance from Jeremy Bobb."
10539,0,"For all it aspires to say about the foolhardy nature of those seeking purpose in the west, Butcher’s Crossing lacks the patience to follow through when it counts."
10540,1,"Nic Cage is unrecognisable, but this new western unfortunately fails to live up to its potential. It continues the strong streak Cage is having in his career at the moment, but would have benefitted from some narrative restructuring."
10541,0,"While doing the original Butcher’s Crossing justice would be difficult under most circumstances, the end results can be chalked up to the source material being simply too good, too graceful for talent this amateurish."
10542,1,"Though solidly made, it’s a Western without enough fire or novelty to attract a great deal of interest, though its two leads should keep it from getting lost in the crowd completely."
10543,1,"The supporting cast delivers fine work, even though most of the characters feel surface-level. The same sentiment can be extended to the film itself, a merely fine accomplishment that fails to dig deeper beneath intriguing themes."
10544,1,A sturdy and subdued Nicolas Cage leads the otherwise rocky adaptation of John Williams’ western novel.
10545,0,A film that’s just too inert and too superficial to dig into the deep philosophical underpinnings of its source.
10546,1,Butcher's Crossing is not the typical Western that one thinks of when it comes to the genre.
10547,0,"As a character [Will Andrews], his hero’s journey isn’t engrossing. He’s the subject of this movie and isn’t portrayed as an observer but a background character in his own story."
10548,1,Butcher’s Crossing benefits from a seriously commanding Cage performance...
10549,1,"A severely principled Western tale with clear, to the point of being obvious, points to make about the evils of plundering the land. The reasons are not limited to Manifest Destiny, capitalism and macho pride, but those are probably the big three."
10550,1,'Butcher’s Crossing' is a gorgeous travelog and a warning about what happens when people fail to tread lightly in the natural world.
10551,1,"A bleak, abstract Western."
10552,1,"Uneven, but good enough to survive the hunt."
10553,1,A compelling film that brings to life a side of the cowboy genre not often explored.

10584,1,"The individual performances are great and the images are stunning, and -- perhaps most important -- Gladiator offers an escapist quality that makes its derivative flaws seem minor."
10585,1,"Gladiator is not a bad film at all; in fact, it's visually stunning, easily the most impressive work Scott has done since ""Blade Runner."" But it is apparent that reaction to this film is splitting along a fault line called ""age."""
10586,1,"This Ancient Roman swords-and-sandals epic is one of the last big-budget, grandiose Hollywood blockbusters to win Best Picture."
10587,1,Great visual spectacle and first-rate entertainment... [Full review in Spanish]
10588,1,"When the dust finally settled, “Gladiator” pulled off a few minor miracles. It catapulted Crowe into super-stardom, removed any doubt that Scott could work within any particular genre with success, and took a dusty old genre and made it new again."
10589,1,"Gladiator benefits from a second half that is, given its focus on Maximus’ vengeance-fueled exploits, virtually overflowing with spellbinding interludes..."
10590,1,"The film’s most important effect, if you will, is Crowe himself as the unabashed hero General Maximus, followed closely by Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor Commodus. Gladiator is at heart their simple story."
10591,0,"It is an honorable movie, so are they all honorable movies. But that's not enough. It's not great. It's a disappointment. Caesar hates disappointment, so kill it swiftly and be done."
10592,1,"The new film has spectacular fight scenes in dazzling sets and a familiar story about honor and betrayal, courage and cowardice. It's the perfect vehicle for some old-fashioned sword-clanging fun."
10593,1,"Gladiator delivers everything its title promises. The surprise is that this bold revival of the period ""sword-and-sandals"" epic does so with solid acting, sure pacing and superior style interspersed with payoff-worthy pathos."
10594,1,"Such magnitude demands a heroically proportioned star, and Russell Crowe is the man, muscled but mournful and quietly spiritual. All hail, Maximus."
10595,1,"Gladiator gets kudos for attempting to give a fresh face to the genre but it's merely a good, not great, film."
10596,1,"The real star of the film is director Ridley Scott, who transports you from the comfort of your theater seat to the darkness that was Rome."
10597,1,The blend of digital imagery and contemporary showmanship combine to make you feel like a privileged ticket-holder at a compellingly ghastly program in the most famous arena on Earth.
10598,0,The way the movie repeatedly drives home the motivations for Phoenix's paternally scorned neurosis and Crowe's proud victim becomes repetitious; you think they could have brought some more shading to the characters in 160 minutes.
10599,1,"A mountain, a fever dream, an epic poem of a motion picture. Equal parts Ben-Hur and Braveheart, it is a victory not likely to be equaled any time soon."
10600,1,"Wholly improbable and voluptuously satisfying, Gladiator and its sheer shivery pleasure in cinematic spectacle and big emotion deserve a very Roman ""thumbs up."""
10601,0,"There is a plot, but it is at once so derivative and so undernourished that it never really registers as a story. As far as it goes, it's ""Spartacus Lite,"" minus that epic's moral grandeur."
10602,1,"We're on the cusp of a new golden age for moviemaking. Ridley Scott is hardly equipped to light the way, but that he or anybody is willing to deliver a jolt of electricity to a genre as dead and dumb as the Roman epic is thrilling in itself."
10603,0,"Gladiator isn’t awful, but it ain’t exactly a Roman holiday."
10604,0,"Simple, mediocre, improbable. [Full review in Spanish]"
10605,1,Still highly entertaining despite Kevin's family being very problematic. Daniel Stern and Joe Pesci brought some great comedy to their scenes.
10606,1,This still holds up and is pretty funny despite the bad parenting.
10607,1,"I'm ""Team Kevin"" all the way. He's a hero."
10608,1,You can never go wrong with frequent Home Alone viewings because the laughs never end!
10609,0,"When it's going somewhere, Home Alone is quite funny. But Hughes and Columbus hung too much on the scene-setting slight idea; the film brings too much baggage, and the trip seems much too long."
10610,1,"A not completely unnuanced riff on the themes of family, safety and sanctity."
10611,1,"The degree to which Home Alone's various components work, and work exceedingly well, is generally nothing short of astonishing..."
10612,1,"Expert conceptual construction from celebrated writer-director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Trains, Planes & Automobiles) elevates a low-flying caper comedy to great heights."
10613,1,A lot of people love Home Alone around the holidays but I love Home Alone year round.
10614,1,Home Alone has a premise that over the years became classic and an execution that was endearing from the beginning. [Full Review in Spanish]
10615,1,"The charisma of Macaulay Culkin matched with the intelligent script by John Hughes makes this the definitive holiday story that it is, appealing to all ages."
10616,1,"[Culkin] is a vivid screen presence, almost incandescent with confidence."
10617,1,Home Alone seems to be nominating itself as a Christmas classic [and] the film does go some way toward getting the job done.
10618,1,Home Alone delivers enough laughs.
10619,1,The whole thing is gloriously tinged with nostalgia.
10620,1,"Tuned in to two key elements: the joyfulness of Steven Spielberg's ET, and the perennial chase of Tom and Jerry cartoons."
10621,1,A hit for its slapstick humor as well as the age-old theme of a kid who bests the grown-ups.
10622,1,Its endearing story and a charming performance by Culkin make Home Alone a standout among the usual holiday movie fare.
10623,1,"Two decades after it dominated the international box office, the idea continues to carry an almost parasitic charm, as if the underlying subtext of young Kevin's antics are like devices of adamant rebellion that refuse to fade quietly into the night."
10624,0,"A better director could have helped the film out considerably, even saved it... But even then, the script is tremendously weak, by Hughes's standards or anybody else's."
10625,0,"The only really likable thing about this film is Culkin. He's an uncommonly natural child actor, but even he doesn't always survive the tiresome gags (the aftershave bit is funny once; three times is tedious)."
10626,1,A hilarious comedy (although not a very believable one -- there can be no eight-year-olds this ingenious) that kids will love and adults won't mind sitting through either.
10627,1,"The movie is quite enjoyable as long as it explores the fantasy of a neglected little boy having an entire house of his own to explore and play in, and it still manages to be fun when he exhibits superhuman ingenuity and resourcefulness."
10628,1,"Pic boasts wonderful casting, with Culkin a delight as funny, resilient Kevin, and O'Hara bringing a snappy, zesty energy to the role of mom."
10629,0,"A funny, but overrated family comedy"
10630,1,"There are few movies that can be described as never having a dull moment, and Home Alone fits in this small group. It's the perfect family holiday film."
10631,1,A lot of Hughes' hooray-for-suburban-misfits sensibility survives the milling process.
10632,0,watching this all again today with a critical eye reveals that Home Alone's prat-fall humor has gotten completely worn out

10655,1,"Looking brave, wise, and yet vulnerable, Culkin is perfect for the role."
10656,0,"Home Alone is the apex, the pinnacle, the culmination of every bad bit Hughes has ever written or directed."
10657,1,"Forget the cartoonish bad guys, this film is about overcoming fears and taking control of your life."
10658,1,"This holiday contender from John Hughes is too crass, too loud and too violent to be added blithely to Christmas viewing traditions. But it is funny."
10659,1,"Chris Columbus's junky, rambunctiously funny Home Alone is every kid's anarchical wish come true."
10660,1,"The performances are very good, especially by young Culkin and Pesci and Stern."
10661,0,"If Home Alone had limited itself to the things that might possibly happen to a forgotten 8-year-old, I think I would have liked it more."
10662,0,The movie devolves into an egregious Three Stooges painfest: We're meant to giggle and clap along with Kevin as the crooks get their heads singed with blowtorches and walk barefoot on glass.

10700,0,The movie devolves into an egregious Three Stooges painfest: We're meant to giggle and clap along with Kevin as the crooks get their heads singed with blowtorches and walk barefoot on glass.
10701,0,"Despite great chemistry between Pine and Pugh and amazing production & costume design, the obvious and nonsensical plot and Harry Styles' unconvincing performance ultimately sinks the film. Also: Why is this 2 hours long?!"
10702,1,"There is a great film in the bones of the one we are presented with, one that is neater and more compact and doesn’t struggle with the internal logic it presents."
10703,0,An array of half-baked ideas that add up to nothing much more than a world of mirages.
10704,0,"The ample running time clocks in at just over two hours, and there is no doubt that Don’t Worry Darling would be improved with at least 15 fewer minutes of the simmering dread..."
10705,0,Don't Worry Darling isn’t a bad psychological thriller. It merely crumbles under the weight of its own mediocrity.
10706,0,"a puzzle box of a movie with an engaging premise that dives into themes of control. Florence Pugh is INCREDIBLE, Harry Styles holds his own, & Olivia Wilde really ups her game as a director here… but left wanting more from the film"
10707,0,"If this was expected to be a groundbreaking comment on feminism, then it missed the mark by a long shot."
10708,1,"Don’t Worry Darling is ultimately a film about a woman who tries her best to free herself from a reality controlled by whiny, narcissistic men who’d rather take the easy way out than have a conversation and face their issues."
10709,0,"There are worse movies than Don’t Worry Darling, and there are certainly better ones too. Some thrillers are better able to blend science fiction and shocking twists with dazzling imagery, and others manage to drop the ball more. Ultimately, it's fine."
10710,0,"Olivia Wilde's dystopian thriller is a lovely poison, meaning that while it's beautiful on the surface, it's disorienting and head-scratching underneath – mostly because of that twist."
10711,1,"""Don't Worry Darling"" has many imperfections, but it shows that Wilde can do more than indie comedies, and that she is willing to take on daunting projects."
10712,0,The plotting is completely incoherent and balanced atop a trembling tower of absurdities.
10713,0,"Pugh, Styles, and Pine pour themselves into their roles... grinds to a halt in the third act when we get the presumed twist... it defies logic no one would take it farther. A captivating idea whose explanation rips you out of it."
10714,1,"DON’T WORRY DARLING is a poisoned fairy tale, and is a story of the reclamation of the self that is thrilling, beautiful, and thematically on the mark. It’s so on the mark, in fact, that it’s liable to make people angry, especially men."
10715,1,"All the same, Wilde’s film has its wins, mostly in how sharp-eyed it manages to be about the violent insistence of conservative male fantasias."
10716,0,"The set-up is so well handled that it’s aggravating when Wilde reveals the twist — which I won’t here, because of “spoilers” and because if I start lamenting where it goes wrong, I may never stop."
10717,0,"[It's] a good-looking movie, and it has its moments, but overall, I felt like the ""1950s-type-suburbia-are-hiding-something-sinister"" theme was just too shopworn."
10718,1,The script's structure (and Wilde's direction) is quite good. I just wish it was in service of having something more to say since its abruptness ultimately prevents it from having to say anything.
10719,0,Hollow and disappointing.
10720,0,"All style and little substance, Darling has nothing you haven’t already seen..."
10721,0,"Actress Olivia Wilde follows her winning directorial debut, 2019’s Booksmart, with a movie that’s scriptstupid."
10722,1,"Unfortunately, this is less strong than Wilde’s directorial debut Booksmart. Still, there is superb sound design and an action-packed finale sequence that feels mostly satisfying, even if the resolution could be better than you’d hope for."
10723,0,"Don't Worry Darling is a pretty film to look at, and has a partly intriguing mystery on its outset, but it ultimately succumbs to a lack of development and a predictable, half-baked ending that just isn't worth the two-hour wait to get there."
10724,0,[A] missed opportunity.
10725,0,A repetitive mess that never expands past its first idea.
10726,1,All depends on how willing you are to suspend your disbelief over a film that comes with so many expectations and external drama. I’d recommend just grabbing some popcorn and enjoying Wilde’s ride.
10727,1,"Bets it all and goes to the depth of its possibilities... For this, Don't Worry Darling will earn lovers and haters alike, but it always plays its hand, like it or not. [Full review in Spanish]"
10728,0,"When your film becomes about everything, its actually about nothing. Without that focus, Don’t Worry Darling feels like a knockoff of better movies."
10729,0,"It is deliberately opaque. Hard to read or figure out. A cool concept but I am not sure they went far enough. Meaning that it is not fully fleshed out. Plenty was left on the stove bubbling though not totally cooked. It is a shame, really."
10730,0,"Ultimately it does not matter how pretty the house that Wilde built is, when it is built on the weak foundations of a screenplay that crumbles under the weight of its own, and the audiences, expectations."
10731,0,Ultimately middling
10732,1,Layered; a nightmare rooted in a reality that implicates organized misogyny cloaked in coolness and overt social conventions. [Full review in Spanish]
10733,1,“Don’t Worry Darling” (2022) tells an intricate and visually captivating story about marriage dynamics from a perspective not often considered
10734,0,"Ultimately, the film tries to work with too many ideas without giving them one direction, creating a messy narrative that looks pretty on the outside but conflicting when carefully analyzed, similar to the Victoria Project."
10735,1,finds enough intriguing and compelling means of dramatizing and turning its domestic horrors inside out that it remains engaging right up until the final frames
10736,0,"If only the movie were as fascinating as seeing the cast act a damn fool while promoting it. As a friend of mine said recently, let’s hope this press tour never ends."
10737,1,"Despite its predictability, contrivances, derivative themes, a scattered and choppy third act, and bounty of partially realized ideas the film is undeniably watchable, even engrossing at times."
10738,0,"Thematically it's all over the place, never quite figuring out how to synthesize its ideas in a coherent or satisfying way."
10739,0,"After this promising start the film seems not to know quite where to go next. The ending is certainly a let-down, and perhaps the screenplay should have had another rewrite."
10740,1,"Muddled in places, it nonetheless shows ambition and furthers Pugh’s reputation as one of the most watchable stars of the moment."
10741,1,"Don't Worry Darling bursts the bubble of virtuality and forces us to ask ourselves the uncomfortable questions that we usually avoid, is it valid to build success on a fantasy that others assume to be real? [Full Review in Spanish]"
10742,0,Our look at Olivia Wilde’s DON’T WORRY DARLING ... The film was surrounded by controversy long before its Venice premiere. In this review we are left trying to answer the question everyone is asking: was it worth all the drama?
10743,1,Wilde knows how to cast just as well as she knows how to lay impeccably manicured and yet insidiously tense scenes.
10744,0,"Where Don’t Worry Darling unfortunately fumbles is the screenplay by Katie Silberman ... Based on a story credit by two men responsible for Chernobyl Diaries and, yes, Titanic II, the story is an amalgamation of a whole host of influences."
10745,1,"There's no question this is an open-and-shut case of Styles over substance, but Pugh's phenomenally ferocious femme grabs the story by the throat and does not let go."
10746,0,"The sluggish and predictable plot fizzles, and the film leaves little lasting impression."
10747,0,"The initial charm of the visuals doesn’t go anywhere and Wilde’s approach to it feels insubstantial, all superficial flourishes with little underneath that feels genuinely interrogative or revealing or thoughtful. Great gowns, though. Beautiful gowns."
10748,0,"Despite Pugh’s amazing performance, the film’s inability to go deeper into the narrative’s dark core causes it to flounder amid its superficiality."
10749,0,"Don’t worry darling, you can look it up when you get home."
10750,0,"The script lacks grace and polish, one star’s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead’s performance, and Olivia Wilde‘s direction is noticeably weak."
10751,0,"Despite its compelling premise and Florence Pugh's remarkable performance, the film loses steam as it delves into its mysteries and secrets. [Full Review in Spanish]"
10752,0,"“Don't Worry Darling” is a huge disappointment—a film that wasn't without potential, but ultimately took the simplest possible routes. Full review in Spanish."
10753,0,"For better, or perhaps for worse, we’ll be talking about this thing for years to come."
10754,1,It doesn't make a lot of sense but you have a lot of fun figuring out it makes no sense.
10755,0,"Don’t Worry Darling is initially captivating because of all that it promised but when it devolves into little more than a few nods to stronger, more memorable predecessors, it becomes victim to its own ambitions and set-up."
10756,0,A frustratingly empty sophomore effort.
10757,0,"This is a film in which the real plot only turns up for the last half-hour or so. And by that time, I wasn't worried, darling. I was nearly asleep."
10758,0,"The film clearly wants to make salient points about patriarchal control and toxic/fragile masculinity, but they're undercut by the blunt storytelling and nonsensical denouement."
10759,1,"""Don't Worry Darling"" serves its purpose as a thrilling, mystery drama. It's not the best film of the year, but you can have fun with it."
10760,1,"The film sets out to lure us into the retro fantasy so that we can share the shock of Alice’s awakening - which looks a lot like a mental breakdown, with Pugh acting in a much more realistic register than anyone else."
10761,0,"Despite the title of Olivia Wilde’s controversial movie, it turns out there are plenty of things in it to be concerned about."
10762,1,"There’s more here that needed to be developed, but there’s a certain momentum present that manages to keep Wilde’s splashy dish from being entirely undercooked."
10763,0,"Don’t Worry Darling originally looked set to be one of the better films of the year but it is sunk by a messy screenplay, laboured narrative, and ultimately unsatisfying finale."
10764,0,"A collection of tired tropes and befuddling questions, it largely skates by on some decent performances and a mood that (intentionally) curdles in a fashion that’s all too-familiar"
10765,1,"As we plummet into the Big Reveal — Black Mirror fans might see it coming — things fall apart, logistically and conceptually, though in an undeniably spectacular way."
10766,0,"Once the truth is all revealed, it all feels very meh, and you find yourself saying ohh ok – that’s a decision. The editing confused the watcher at times..."
10767,0,Don't Worry Darling confirms Wilde's talent as a director but perhaps she needs to be more discerning about the scripts she takes on.
10768,0,"What was meant to be a triumph on screen has instead become a mere mention in the footnotes of all this drama, and leaves viewers with a story that's as empty as the egg shells in Victory."
10769,0,"It takes a while for Don’t Worry Darling to reveal itself as abysmal, because it spends such a grueling amount of time being merely pedestrian."
10770,1,"A tense, intelligent skewering of MAGA fantasies that nevertheless struggles with its big reveals."
10771,1,“Don’t Worry Darling” is a well-made motion picture with outstanding production values and a spectacular lead performance by Florence Pugh at its core. It also proves that filmmaker Olivia Wilde can direct an action sequence with the best of them.
10772,1,"Sans a few explosive sequences, this plays like a pretty straight-forward old-school, psychological thriller that is more interested in finding a way out of the mystery than establishing a more pertinent theme out of the premise it creates"
10773,1,"One hoped it was either a hot mess or a cinematic masterpiece to fit with the online narrative. Unfortunately, it's a film that makes you second-guess yourself on whether it's good or bad, instead taking the boring middle way of being just fine."
10774,0,Too glib to be convincing.
10775,1,"If you are fascinated by stories on controlled chaos and experimental societies, you’ll enjoy this thriller."
10776,0,"Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling is a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes celebrity scandal, helping to keep an otherwise forgettable film in the public’s consciousness."
10777,0,It’s all very alluring and sexy and intriguing right up until the point when it reveals that it has nothing to say.
10778,1,Ambitious if overwrought and undercooked.
10779,0,I felt as if I'd been invited to a dinner at which the host had set a great table but didn't follow through with a satisfying main course.
10780,1,An engaging and unsettling keep-you-guessing drama — at least until its rushed climax.
10781,0,There’s just no hiding the massive chasm between how smart Don’t Worry Darling thinks it is and how smart it actually is.
10782,0,"Plot holes and unanswered questions will nag at you once Don’t Worry Darling ends. And yet, this is a film that will dissipate from your consciousness the moment you leave the theatre, a vision as flimsy and hollow as any sold by the Victory project."
10783,0,"Looks amazing, and probably had a good script at some point in development. But a lot of bad, bad choices were clearly made here."
10784,0,"The film might well have a raft of “important” things to say about gender roles, sexual politics, the dreaded patriarchy and so forth, yet it's simply a languid dirge that becomes dull, a try-hard film that doesn’t ring the bell it’s clearly reaching for."
10785,0,"...lingers far too long in the Victory Project. In an alternate reality, there’s a brilliant, 95-minute, reimagined, and restructured version of Don’t Worry Darling – one that leaves you with the right kind of questions."
10786,1,"An entertaining thriller replete with well-built tension, mostly elegant acting performances (except for Harry Styles’s), and a richly designed world."
10787,1,"It’s not easy playing most of a film in a state of paranoid terror, and somehow Pugh keeps it from becoming monotonous... This film is one more piece of evidence of this young British actress’ formidable powers."
10788,1,"It is an uneven, but visually compelling, film whose emotional resonance rests on the square shoulders of Pugh, her generation’s answer Kate Winslet."
10789,0,"If the film had been amazing, it still would have been fascinating, but because Don’t Worry Darling is such an out-and-out failure, it is even more so -- all of this chaos for so few returns."
10790,0,"Ultimately, Don’t Worry Darling is best described as style over substance filmmaking. The movie wastes a really interesting world to set up a poorly executed twist. It is desperate to be incredibly smart and edgy but loses a step in sloppy execution."
10791,0,"Metaphors abound, acting as currency for audiences to hypothetically cash out for the twist they know is coming, but the frequent use of repetitive shots ... simply eats up the film's runtime and frustrates viewers wanting to get to the point already."
10792,0,"A mash-up of The Stepford Wives, The Truman Show, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it's a fairly vacuous (though quite stylish) peculiar cinematic hodge-podge that feels as if director Olivia Wilde was channeling director M. Night Shyamalan."
10793,0,"Led by Florence Pugh's redoubtable performance, this glossy thriller draws unfavorable comparisons to a whole swath of different bygone films, cribbing their unsettling undertones without adding much new to the mixture."
10794,0,"Has an extraordinarily hard time keeping any of its many ideas straight, or developing any of them to any real degree."
10795,0,"True, it’s a fabulous looking film but an annoyingly hollow one, and not everyone comes out of it with their dignity intact."
10796,1,"Hallucinatory, sensual and delectably disturbing."
10797,1,"Starts really strong, really surreal... but it kind of peters out by the time you get to the end."
10798,1,"Actor-director Olivia Wilde keeps things intriguing, while deploying properly dazzling imagery. And Florence Pugh delivers such a belting central performance that everyone around her pales by comparison."
10799,0,"Wilde’s film is undeniably interesting but inescapably flawed, conjuring some arresting imagery but landing at a “that’s your lot” finish with a great big indifferent thud."
10800,1,"What is the perfect life, and what would you sacrifice for it? When asked that, teens might have an instant reaction that's wrapped up in identity, independence, and a modern perspective."
10801,0,A “Harry Potter meets Scrooge” hodgepodge enacted on a plateau of plasticity.
10802,1,"While on paper everything about The Polar Express seems to point towards the feature being a disaster, the final product stays on the rails to become anything but."
10803,1,"Director Robert Zemeckis adds tenderness to this roller-coaster ride of a train, the thrill and adrenaline are constantly offset with unrestrained emotional punches."
10804,0,But the technology was not quite up to the challenge of Mr. Zemeckis's vision.
10805,1,A worthy and entertaining film. [Full Review in Spanish]
10806,1,The Polar Express is reminiscent of childhood classics of yore. [Full Review in Spanish]
10807,0,"Polar Express has its moments, but it's not enough. [Full Review in Spanish]"
10808,1,"There is something indescribably unworldly about this picture, and not just because of the pioneering use of motion-capture technology."
10809,0,"The rest is easily summarized: the Polar Express arrives, Hero Boy and some other dead-eyed zombie children get onboard. . .we reach the real Santa, who exists, and drops a little silver bell from his sleigh, which the boy later finds."
10810,1,The trailers and TV commercials for The Polar Express don't do justice to the breathtaking artistry of the film.
10811,0,"The schmaltz content gets higher and higher, as if administered through a drip feed, until by the end we are drowning in sucrose."
10812,0,"People in Hollywood should never work with children or animals, W.C. Fields once said. Maybe that should be expanded to hyper-realistic computer-generated children and reindeer, too."
10813,0,"As a spectacle, The Polar Express looks remarkable. As a film, however, it's the equivalent of an elaborately wrapped Christmas present containing a nice new pair of socks."
10814,0,"Tom Hanks (in a number of roles) and the other actors do a nice job of voicing their parts, but the waxy animated faces they've been given are off-putting."
10815,1,"At some point very early in the 3-D IMAX version of The Polar Express, technology trumps banality and you helplessly surrender to the shock and awe of this big, often thunderous movie."
10816,0,"Though heartfelt, the film tries too hard to dazzle and thrill rather than echo its own message: just believe."
10817,1,Director Robert Zemeckis once again harnesses a new technology to an engaging fable in this digitally animated adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's holiday tale.
10818,0,"Though the emotion feels contrived, that's nothing compared to the flashy set pieces and meticulous detail, which do more to flaunt the technology than move along the story."
10819,0,A train wreck of mind-numbing proportions.
10820,1,The best kids' holiday movie in years.
10821,0,"Even when you look past the unnecessary dangers that the dehumanized child characters in ""The Polar Express"" experience, you're left with a hammered-home theme that says you must believe in a lie to be satisfied on a personal level."
10822,1,Polar Express combines good storytelling with spectacular visuals.
10823,1,"Digital data produced by adult actors wearing special suits spring to life as both adult and kid characters in this dreamy, surreal adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's popular 29-page storybook."
10824,0,"Nearly as much a movie advocating a belief in Santa Claus as a belief in the real existence of CGI animated characters, the film is at once mystifying and uninvolving."
10825,1,"It may not have become the instant holiday classic that its cast and crew were hoping for, but [it's] is a sweet, imaginative adventure that's awfully easy on the eyes."
10826,1,"Cynics will sneeze in shock; children, young and old, will cuddle up and dream along."
10827,0,"As a complete package, Zemeckis' surreal, hallucinogenic adventure is pretty inconsequential."
10828,0,More like Night of the Living Dead.
10829,1,"What the book does so deliriously, and what the movie only hints at, is that time-honored belief that, as a child, anything is possible and magical characters like Santa Claus and the emotions they represent will last forever."
10830,1,The animation looks like an oil painting come to life and the overall viewing experience is awe inspiring.
10831,1,"...might better be called The Bipolar Express, with so much that is sweet and light on the one hand and so much that is tiring and humdrum on the other."
10832,0,"Unfortunately, Zemeckis has allowed his technical-savvy, circus-like movie to lose touch with its human charcaters, resulting in a cold and distanced animation."
10833,0,How many kids do you know who would find comfort in a homeless ghost who drinks his own sock juice?
10834,1,...the IMAX Corporation would do well to have this available every year in 3D. They have finally come upon their staple film.
10835,0,The Polar Express seems overly concerned with aping real life instead of creating its own universe.
10836,1,
10837,1,People will be polarized by this well-oiled machine of a family holiday vehicle.
10838,0,"Strap yourself in and try not to vomit, because this is more of a theme-park event than a movie -- Pirates of the Caribbean in reverse, a wild ride stripped of its story, down to a rattling series of obvious, underwhelming effects."
10839,1,"The story is quite simple, but the well-written script keeps the story moving at a decent pace."
10840,0,"Despite some technical pizzazz, this flick ends up leaving viewers as cold as the North Pole itself."
10841,1,A warm fuzzy for the holidays
10842,1,"Sure, it's overly saccharine and desperately overblown, and the film loses momentum well before the end, but it's hard not to get into the spirit and enjoy it."
10843,0,A failed and lifeless experiment in which everything goes wrong.
10844,1,"To help the viewer accept the creepily lifelike quality of the animated characters, the filmmakers fill in the background with beautifully illustrated vistas, dark and mysterious, greatly resembling the original paintings Van Allsburg did for his book."
10845,0,"Besides its dead-eyed cast, this 'animated' escapade is thrown off the tracks by pointless detours seemingly intended just to stretch the journey time."
10846,0,"On Donner, on Blitzen, on Tron."
10847,1,Utterly enchanting (and 'enchanting' isn't a word I often use)
10848,1,"Enchanting, if disconcerting, feel-good fare loaded with predictable, wholesome messages but crammed with enough Christmas wonderment to off-set the saccharine."
10849,1,"Unfortunately, the journey proves far more interesting than the destination."
10850,0,"Zemeckis had a chance to do something truly wonderful. Instead, he slaps together something depressingly mediocre."
10851,1,Tem imenso potencial para se tornar um daqueles clssicos obrigatrios nas festas de fim de ano.
10852,1,Maravillosas secuencias ubrrimas de color y magia.
10853,0,a deeply confused Hollywood rendering of childhood innocence by way of computer-generated roller-coaster thrills
10854,1,"And while this is a technological advancement, the system still needs improvement. The characters at times look and feel unnatural, their eyes are missing their sparkle."
10855,1,"Frequently exciting, a little scary ... and rather sweet at times. Actually, it's mostly over-sweet."
10856,1,"Artwork is beautiful, there are some good songs, but the characters lack expressiveness."
10857,1,"While the scenic visuals are incredible... the character animation, presumably intended to be realistic and yet have a storybook feel, is at times somewhat creepy."
10858,0,"The world of the movie is the stuff of childhood fancy, but it never engages us in that transcendent way that brings even the most hardened adults into its imagination."
10859,0,"The positives are more technological than character driven, which has been the problem that director Robert Zemeckis has faced since he won the Oscar for Forrest Gump."
10860,0,"has good intentions, but doesn't quite succeed because its animation style is a little too inadvertently creepy for a mainstream Christmas flick"
10861,0,My first response was that I had just seen the world's first Christmas horror movie.
10862,0,This praiseworthy film has been awarded highest honors from Puissant Guide and All-Fertile Giftgiver Kris Kringle.
10863,1,"I found the film satisfying and a good ""G"" rated film the whole family can enjoy."
10864,0,"Everything is so nearly real, down to the characters' hair fluttering in the icy wind, that it's uneasily surreal, the way that clowns scare tots more than they amuse them."
10865,1,Children will be enthralled but for adults the book is better.
10866,1,"Its rich characters, spectacular visuals, and unbridled sense of awe and wonder make this the kind of movie families will want to watch together every holiday season."
10867,0,"Adopting ""performance capture"" animation technique, the heartwarming Christmas classic tale is presented here as distanced and cold as its title.**"
10868,1,Go in preparation for the upcoming holiday season; don't go expecting groundbreaking CGI...
10869,1,.......an unbelievable ride on a truly magical train. This is a film that must be seen on the big screen.
10870,1,"The Polar Express is a spectacular train ride from start to finish. The movie is much more than an awesome visual experience, however.....it also has plenty of heart."
10871,1,"In terms of awesome spectacle, the movie delivers and should really be viewed as it was meant to be: In 3-D IMAX."
10872,0,"In a word, it's soulless."
10873,0,"Its storybook look and early energy is enthralling, but the end message is not so much that believing keeps you young as it does guarantee membership in an important club."
10874,1,"The numerous kids in the audience responded with rapt attention and applause at the end, so it's safe to say your kids will love it."
10875,1,"In the end, the computer wizardry palls, but the story's heart chugs on triumphantly."
10876,0,Some books aren't meant to be made into movies. This is one of them.
10877,0,A real snoozer.
10878,1,... An early and unexpectedly intelligent gift.
10879,0,"A film creepy as it is uncreative, The Polar Express creates a filmmaking experience that gives us Steven Tyler as a singing elf."
10880,0,"Watch out, all you kids who don't believe in Santa. You will believe. Or else."
10881,1,"All Time High's two main characters have great chemistry, and the whole charismatic cast doesn't hold anything back."
10882,1,"The comedy genre was created to humorously exaggerate situations, language, action, and characters, and All-Time High ticks all these boxes with its take on screwball comedy."
