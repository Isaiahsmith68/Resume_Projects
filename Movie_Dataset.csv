rotten,"Too much of the expository heavy lifting and strangely deep political discourse is done by the dialogue, pretty much suffocating any comedic potential in the process..."
fresh,"This meant-to-be-forgettable action comedy relies heavily on the universal appeal of the ever-charming Cena, which makes it all the more enjoyable. I had a fun time watching this one."
fresh,"When this film concentrates on its main point - that of how media can manipulate how a world leader is soon and how war is not always justified - it is on song. However, the film struggles with its tone, often not knowing whether it is drama or comedy."
rotten,"If you’re going to make a movie like Freelance, you’ve got to find a single moment (preferably two or three) that stands out and is mind-blowingly different than any other film."
rotten,Freelance progresses into a sluggish and hopelessly uninvolving midsection...
rotten,Freelance is an utter disaster that I can't believe John Cena and Alison Brie agreed to be a part of.
rotten,"“Freelance” is an incredibly goofy jumble of tones, flailing about as it overstays its welcome. There’s no need to hire this contractor."
rotten,"A head-scratching disaster that doesn’t so much as mix genres and tones but rather puzzlingly cycles through them with no apparent reason or thematic purpose, desperately hoping something starts to click"
rotten,"""Very dumb"" barely covers how silly and violent this half-assed Banana Republic riff turns out to be."
rotten,"This lifeless, generic, confusing, unfunny mess is so glaringly out of touch with reality that it makes your head hurt."
rotten,"Despite the likeable lead actors, Freelance is an instantly forgettable movie."
rotten,There’s an oppressive nothingness to “Freelance.” No romance. No comedy. No action.
rotten,It’s as if the studio saw the success of The Lost City and decided to type in “Tropical romantic-action-comedy with cheaper actors” on ChatGPT and hit enter.
rotten,"It will appeal only to those who would march into hell for John Cena, and its content reflects the barren, scorched scenery such fans would discover there — a wasteland of his considerable potential for mugging, making jokes and mowing people down."
rotten,"Cena and Brie appear as bored as they must have been doing the same stunts, making the same jokes, and being expected to carry material like this..."
rotten,Freelance is the kind of movie that once gathered dust in direct-to-DVD bins at Blockbuster.
rotten,This lackluster effort from director Pierre Morel signals that we have entered the dark age action comedies.
rotten,"Pretty much a copy of a copy of a copy with microscopic tweaks made along the way, viewers can be forgiven for thinking they’ve seen Freelance before because it’s so wildly indistinguishable from any other similarly minded films."
rotten,"Freelance is a low-rent, low-frills, low-energy action-comedy. Despite the copious talent of a strong cast, they fail to elevate the experience to something remotely entertaining."
rotten,"Laughs aren’t present in the feature, which eventually sheds its comedic interests, giving viewers a film of confusing tonality."
rotten,"Instead of getting into the action or the comedy, Freelance stops itself dead in its tracks to go over and over the laborious plotting of this story."
rotten,Some decent action scenes but the comedy falls flat.
rotten,"Watching the horrible action comedy flick Freelance is like being stuck in a putrid cesspool of idiocy, much like the film's main characters are stuck in a swampy jungle. The cast members have no chemistry with each other. The plot is formulaic junk."
rotten,"Even the most cherished daydream needs a bit of skill and finessing if it’s to translate to the big screen, and that’s where Freelance falls fatally short — yielding not an uplifting escape, but an enervating bore."
rotten,"By its conclusion, what we’re left with is a cinematic Frankenstein, whose disparate genre elements have been cobbled together without much consideration or fuss."
rotten,"Freelance is an eyesore of horrendous digital effects, features uninspired action, and wastes the few big names in its cast."
rotten,John Cena deserves better. And so do we.
rotten,The only constant is the viewer’s boredom.
rotten,A mild rom-com. It did not entirely work for me... I did not feel the chemistry between David Duchovny and Meg Ryan.
rotten,That Meg Ryan comeback. Let's pretend it didn't happen.
fresh,"This isn’t a great movie by any stretch, but it’s nice to see Ryan back doing her thing while also showing us she’s matured as an actor in ways I wasn’t certain she would."
rotten,"Another unfair break for Ryan, as I imagine a less interesting version of this movie would have been more warmly received."
fresh,"Despite its flaws, it’s easy to be charmed by the unconventional flair of this modern love story."
rotten,Why Duchovny and Ryan would ever unite is one of the big mysteries of this film. The two aren’t the first you think of when it comes to ticking off lists of weather events.
fresh,What Happens Later has a disarming charm that sneaks up on you.
rotten,"the behavior of the two “adults” does not make much sense as they banter, complain, criticize and emote about their past and present lives. I should care about the characters but I do not – at all."
rotten,"Ryan's fans will be thrilled to see her back on screen, but it's unlikely others will want to ""have what she's having."""
rotten,"It's hard to take much heart out of the message, here. It turns out that ""What Happens Later"" is we're all stuck, each with our own version of our past, one that doesn't allow us to learn much from it."
rotten,"The premise has wings and Ryan + Duchovny are well-matched, but just like the planes grounded on the tarmac, the movie fails to take flight."
rotten,"The cloud of dissatisfaction I felt after watching it kept trying to reshape its molecules into a better movie, albeit one that could live only in my head."
fresh,"Ryan and Duchovny deliver compelling, affecting performances despite the lackluster screenplay."
fresh,"What Happens Later is the kind of thing the studios that made Ryan’s earlier romantic comedies seem to have walked away from. Fortunately, if only this one time, she has brought it back -- older, wryer maybe, but just as smart and just as heartfelt."
fresh,"Meg Ryan returning to the big screen in the genre that launched her career made me exceptionally giddy. Though Meg and David Duchovny were clearly having a good time, the overall story could have been a bit more memorable."
rotten,"While Ryan and Duchovny have good chemistry and bring emotional truth to Willa and Bill, the situation that allows for this to happen never ceases to feel artificial and forced. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,The key is understanding that nobody makes it to that age without handling as much baggage as an airport. That’s what makes Ms. Ryan’s second directorial effort a surprising treat.
fresh,The chemistry between Duchovny and Ryan takes flight long before the planes are ready to board.
fresh,Duchovny and Ryan have nice chemistry and there are some sweet moments as they unravel their past
fresh,Life and love have a different taste when there are more years behind than ahead.
rotten,"Despite some laughs along the way, it drags more than it delights."
rotten,"If listening to Ryan and co-star David Duchovney chit-chat for two hours is your idea of a good time, go for it. Others, beware. It is, as the Brits say, “A bit twee.”"
rotten,"In an attempt to revive the rom-com, Meg Ryan takes us to the most unfunny and unromantic place imaginable, a regional airport."
rotten,"What Happens Later has such a chip on its shoulder about its relationship to its own maligned genre that it never actually gets around to much by way of pleasure, which you might argue is that genre’s main purpose."
rotten,"Ryan’s return to the romcom might remind us of her rare skillset within the genre but it also makes us crave more, the answer to What Happens Later being ultimately: not that much."
fresh,"“What Happens Later” doesn't reach the heights of Ryan’s beloved romantic comedies, but its sweet comforts might be just the ticket if you’re looking for laughter-through-tears on the couch on a Sunday afternoon."
rotten,"What’s missing in “What Happens Later” is outright startling: whimsy. Or maybe it’s heart — or both? Basically, there’s something vacant behind the metaphoric eyes of the film, because there’s nothing going on beneath the surface."
fresh,Seeing Meg Ryan in a romantic comedy is a treat to us all.
fresh,"Though not her best romantic comedy, there is still much to love about Meg Ryan's latest."
fresh,"It’s a delight to welcome Meg Ryan back to the silver screen after an extended hiatus, and in the genre she helped rejuvenate. Innovatively eschewing genre tropes, she favors authentic character drive — with just a little twee magic sprinkled in."
rotten,"Drab, grayscale shots of a man and woman sitting at the gate are not my idea of a good time, especially when underscored by David Boman’s sappy Hallmark movie music."
fresh,"What Happens Later has a wily charm about it in the way that it just keeps pushing — pushing to be noticed, pushing to be obvious, pushing to be loved. If it doesn't all the way work, it's a commendable effort and a reminder of Ryan's considerable charms."
rotten,"Those in search of the soothingly feel-good vibes offered by Rob Reiner and Nora Ephron would be wise to look elsewhere, as Ryan has instead crafted what basically amounts to Before Sunset for the AARP crowd... [but without any] emotional honesty."
rotten,"Had the film focused on the heart of the drama and let these two characters engage with their messy history together, this could have been flying high. Unfortunately, what we get stays flat on the ground."
fresh,Subverts the expectations of what one would expect of Will and Wilehmina’s meet-cute reunion as the artifice of its set-up starts to fall away and the two can get real with one another about where they are in their lives.
fresh,"Ryan and Duchovny both have the charm, mileage in life, and acting chops to adeptly shift from comedy to drama on a dime, which makes What Happens Later work very well."
fresh,"A film like this doesn’t need to do anything new as long as you have two leads that can sell the material, and Ryan and Duchovny do just that."
fresh,"“What Happens Later” is so deeply heartfelt and so beautifully performed that it stirs something within — a hope, not necessarily for an airport rendezvous but for a moment of healing, the kind that everyone desires and everyone deserves."
rotten,"Meg Ryan and David Duchovny are ready for a better, more rewarding film than What Happens Later."
rotten,What Happens Later makes us feel stuck in this story that doesn't have much to say or do and takes a long time to get there.
fresh,"While it’s unlikely to join the rom-com pantheon, its charming leads and humorous truths do invoke the spirit of Ephron, to whom the film is dedicated."
rotten,What Happens Later is so overwritten and cumbersome that it feels like you are there for every minute of that overnight delay rather than a 103-minute movie
fresh,"Isn’t big on tingles, but it does have Ryan and co-star David Duchovny, who share decent chemistry in this tale of regret, helping to bring an otherwise static but deeply felt picture to life."
fresh,"""What Happens Later"" does give off the feel of an Ephron film, and that's meant as a compliment since laughter, reflection, compassion and even understanding and misunderstandings."
rotten,"A romantic comedy that tries to be funny, whimsical, and deep, but ends up being none of those things."
fresh,"What Happens Later isn't without some hiccups in its execution, but with Meg Ryan back at the helm, it's impossible not to feel charmed."
rotten,"For all of its build-up, the movie ultimately deflates with a disappointing squeal, like a half-blown-up balloon that someone abandoned because finishing the process felt like too much work."
fresh,"“What Happens Later” is no rom-com, but it’s a surprisingly moving chapter in Ryan’s screen story; a gentle reminder that we carry our pasts with us — and that sometimes, we get a second chance to make things right."
fresh,"A sparkling romantic comedy. Meg Ryan and David Duchovny are magic together. Enchanting, witty and delightful. It's a warm, funny and tender journey well worth taking. See it with someone you love."
rotten,"This might have worked as a short film or a 30-minute TV episode, but as a feature film, it grows increasingly cloying as the minutes tick on."
fresh,A young audience may not fully appreciate the existential quandary the two principals face here. But those with a little more life under their belts will likely feel differently.
rotten,"What might have proved effective theatrically comes across as wholly artificial and schematic onscreen, despite Ryan’s considerable efforts as both director and performer."
fresh,"Maybe somebody somewhere has made a better American film about mature love, but at this moment, I can’t think of any."
fresh,"While recapturing the vibe of her '90s oeuvre, the film advances the formula for people who have grown up since then."
rotten,"Not having seen Steven Dietz’s play ‘Shooting Star,’ it is difficult to determine what cowriter (with Dietz and Kirk Lynn)/director Meg Ryan saw in his airport romance, but what she’s done with it is something best left on the tarmac."
fresh,"Guess what? It works, even offering some LOL moments along the way in a movie that isn’t trying to reinvent anything here, just finding a new angle to squeeze some more life out of it."
fresh,I liked it just enough to get me through the end credits...
rotten,"“Not very good,” but “Too cute to hate” will have to do."
fresh,"Family Switch is fun, whimsical and entertaining enough to keep me mostly hooked throughout its 101-minute duration."
rotten,The gag here is a predictable and old one...
fresh,"Family Switch yields some laughs, some cringe, and a fair amount of heart, even if it doesn't tread new ground for this ridiculous, beloved premise."
fresh,"This new riff on the body swap comedy is more than a little familiar, but a charming cast makes it a breezy watch."
rotten,"It’s simply hard to feel all that deeply for characters so flat and sweet they might as well be gingerbread people, resolving problems that barely seemed to exist in the first place."
rotten,"The real nail in the coffin is the film’s messaging about the power of family, which is about as tacked-on and stilted as they come — hardly a shock in light of the rest of the Netflix holiday movie lineup."
rotten,"There are plenty of shots of the dog urinating under the Christmas tree, as well as a close-up of a colonoscopy souvenir photo, and a recurring joke that involves... snarfing down ice cream and then furiously farting."
rotten,"There’s no joy in candidly observing that if awfulness were incarnated and saw this movie, it would say, “Whoa, too awful for me.”"
rotten,"An unexpectedly aggressive viewing experience that immediately suffocates all emotion it offers, while its overall sense of humor is dispiriting."
fresh,"The film has all the right ingredients for an enjoyable family movie with its Christmas magic, wholesome values, adventure and competition, and clever animated ornaments that look just like the actors portraying them."
fresh,A madcap medley of deranged ideas that somehow manage to coalesce into a messy but half-decent Crimbo comedy. Just spare a thought for the far more interesting horror film straining to break through.
fresh,"Ultimately, Murphy delivers a festive watch suitable for the entire family. While Candy Cane Lane may not secure its spot among the most memorable Christmas movies ever made, it undeniably captures the essence that makes seasonal films so beloved."
rotten,"The bizarro plot might help Candy Cane Lane stand out from the bland, busy crowd of new seasonal movies but it’s just as limp and lacking in spirit as the rest of them. Murphy and Ross deserve better, and so do we, and so does Christmas."
rotten,"It’s the overall lethargy of the production that’s disappointing, with the helmer lingering on excess character information, dud jokes, and overplotting, which robs this effort of the fun factor it’s desperately trying to achieve."
fresh,The main thing to say about “Candy Cane Lane” is that Eddie Murphy is funny in it.
rotten,"This comedy-fantasy flick manages to hold your attention only fleetingly, frequently straying off course. Despite the festive backdrop, the film's plot feels undercooked, leaving viewers craving for a more satisfying experience."
fresh,"It’s all fine. Murphy is so much more than that. Or used to be. You like to think that, given the right material, he will be again. Now that would be a gift."
rotten,"“Candy Cane Lane” is a stunningly uneven film that careens between cornball family drama, slapstick comedy and special-effects-laden gimmickry."
fresh,"You want to see Eddie Murphy surrounded by some Christmas-themed silliness. And on that score, it’s fine enough, but destined for regifting."
fresh,"The result swings between manic and sedative, though not always unpleasantly. The saving graces are a zesty Ellis Ross and the enigma that is Murphy, an actor whose comic timing is still casually brilliant."
rotten,The narrative careens through uncompelling territory before ending on a forgettable note.
rotten,"[It] isn’t a chore or a travesty or anything. But certainly, it’s less than Murphy deserves."
fresh,"This one is tailor-made for Murphy’s talents, a comic actor who manages to keep it real and grounded without careening totally out of control."
rotten,"The best way to describe Candy Cane Lane is like if you took the original Jumanji movie and covered it with tinsel and Christmas ornaments. It's mildly clever, but not to the level that it thinks it is."
rotten,"Candy Cane Lane is a rotten, weird, and unfunny mess. Add this junk to the list of Eddie Murphy misfires meant to be crowd pleasers but just turn off many people. There's also a semi-accidental animal cruelty scene that's played for laughs. Horrendous."
fresh,A tame yet enjoyable triumph for fans of the video game. Those unfamiliar with the series might walk away feeling more lost than a devoted fan.
fresh,"You’d be forgiven for expecting a zany, over-the-top romp in which heroes battle the increasingly creepy cartoon animal-like robots as they fight to stay alive, but it isn’t that. Well, OK, it’s … kinda that … eventually."
rotten,All this movie needs is Nic Cage and it'd be fine.
rotten,"A deeply unpleasant and quite ridiculous game of hopscotch among devastating kidnapping thriller, nasty family drama, and empty serial killer nonsense."
rotten,The film mostly concentrates on Mike’s familial travails and history. It flails around trying to come up with psychologically resonant characteristics for its protagonist. It ends up with an inert and implausible narrative.
rotten,"Intended (apparently) as a horror flick, it’s not scary, and, despite the absurdity of the story, it’s not funny. It’s barely anything at all."
fresh,"A lot of it feels like an Elm Street sequel, and you’ve got to respect a film about menacing animatronics that casts Mary Stuart Masterson."
rotten,"An early sequence where we watch these mascots come to life and dispatch a group of people shows promise for something better (and the animatronics do look pretty solid), but it’s all for naught. This is about as good as cardboard pizza."
fresh,"A video game adaptation made overtly for the fans and only the fans.  Newcomers will be totally lost, but it's target audience should have fun."
rotten,So much plot is crammed into this nearly 2-hour film that it's honestly quite shocking that there's nary a scare to be found.
fresh,"Convoluted subplots risk derailing the narrative on more than one occasion, but Freddy and his menacing cohorts, created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, do just about enough to deliver some fun and frights."
rotten,"Seriously, how do you mess up a setup as foolproof as this one?"
rotten,"One of the most forgettable, half-a---d horror movies of the past few years. Five Nights at Freddy's isn't just an ambitious failure; it's a film that treads the water of familiar cliches for an hour and a half and then fizzles out."
rotten,The film struggles to balance its disparate tones and subject matter (fun animatronics with child murder) while barely containing enough scares and violence to act as a gateway horror flick for pre-teens. At least Matthew Lillard is having fun.
rotten,The problem could hinge on the film’s rating. An R might have opened the door to more malevolence. A PG-13 simply makes the lights flicker.
fresh,"As a review, I enjoyed it for what it was, though hardcore fans seem to see Easter eggs left and right. So I'll give it a B- as a midground."
fresh,The FNAF movie will likely work better for hardcore fans than it will for newcomers. The evil Chuck E Cheese aesthetic is effectively fun and the animatronics look great. The main character's story and the Fazbear Pizzeria fail to connect fully.
fresh,"With humor and a few minor bloody scenes plus the ghost children element, Five Nights at Freddy’s falls somewhere between R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps and Gremlins. It’s creepy fun for kids and adults, however, young children may find a few scenes frightening"
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy’s offers some fun thrills and manages to bring the animatronics to life, but unfortunately the same can’t be said for its human characters."
rotten,"Maybe the fans are satiated by reams of lore, but we wanted blood. Even if it was a bit of a gory romp, that wouldn't do much to paper over the technical cracks, like some of its shoddy editing. Josh Hutcherson innocent, of course."
rotten,"It delivers creepy animatronics and excellent visual effects; unfortunately, almost everything else falls flat. The story is unnecessarily convoluted with awkward dialogue, and the impressive slasher sequences are few and far in-between."
fresh,"The film expands the lore of the simple game it's based on, allowing it to go beyond jump scares and cheap thrills. It starts off slow but builds into a satisfying mystery."
rotten,"I wish Five Nights at Freddy’s was wackier, bloodier, and actually scary."
fresh,A lot better than what was expected but let's face it it was the actors in this film that saved it.
rotten,A movie made for gamers and not the general audience.
fresh,"Lulls settle in when Mike’s backstory is belabored or when a cop shows up repeatedly just to drop exposition, but the film should serve as a macabre-cute gateway horror picture for younger audiences and fans of the franchise."
rotten,"... A succession of repetitive scenes replete with bland characters (with the notable exception of William Afton, wonderfully played by Matthew Lillard) that explore '80s iconography retrofitted for the new millennium. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"This adaptation of a popular 2014 video game has some elements that really work well, but ultimately the latest entry to the horror genre falls short in large part to an uneven tone that can’t exactly decide how dark it truly wants to be."
rotten,"[S]ame-day theater and streaming release dates, wicked puppetry, and the Matthew Lillard return to horror. In those regards, this movie did deliver. I choose to save those three things from this burning building as I watch the rest go up in flames."
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a decent entry-level horror flick and the animatronics look fantastic, but it's story is an overstuffed mess that tries to pack in too much lore at once."
fresh,"This is a flawed motion picture, but it offers families the chance to be scared together, and when it works, it is both creepy and fun."
rotten,"So little makes sense in this utterly predictable film, that it makes even the few and far between legit scare sequences not worth it"
rotten,Director Emma Tammi wants the viewer to spend Five Nights at Freddy’s. But it is essentially one night too many.
rotten,"With a cast of one, a single setting, and minimal dialogue, the game did much better storytelling than its overloaded failed-trope adaptation."
fresh,Will probably become a cult classic. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Overall, the film needed more of the tension the video game series is known for, not to mention their arcade-fun terror, but it still serves as a solid Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise opener."
rotten,An intriguing premise undermined by simply terrible storytelling...
rotten,Five Nights at Freddy’s might play better for video game enthusiasts who know this world already. Newcomers might not find the edge they were hoping for.
rotten,"The pacing is bad, the plotting is both convoluted and also somehow weirdly shallow, the writing is laughable, and the action is simplistic. I would not recommend seeing Five Nights at Freddy’s, as it is not good."
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy's could have used a couple more evenings working on the screenplay. Turgid, muddled, and lacking atmosphere, five minutes with Fazbear would have sufficed. One of the worst movies of 2023."
fresh,"There are some pacing issues, and the acting could be more balanced. Keeping the majority of the anxiety inducing chills from the video game franchise it stems from, Five Nights at Freddy’s delivers a solid movie experience."
fresh,"What director Emma Tammi understood was fans of this property dont just want the scares, but the lore as well, which invests you in these weird characters and their fates and brings us back again and again."
fresh,"A so so adaptation that's entertaining enough, but a must-see for the expertly crafted animatronics."
fresh,"Even if Five Nights at Freddy's somewhat ignores the beginning of the game, the film has its charm.  [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Five Nights at Freddy's has a fun and creepy premise, but ultimately is a little too methodical and slowly paced to deliver true thrills."
fresh,A story that will delight both fans of the original video games (FNAF) and newcomers alike. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Five Nights at Freddy’s is just another poor video game adaptation for the garbage pile.
rotten,"The film unsuccessfully tries to merge two disparate tones with an uninteresting and often nonsensical plot. Opportunities for animatronic chaos and excitement are mostly left on the table, resulting in an overall dull affair."
rotten,"It's all very tedious when it's not confusing, and it can't even count on atmosphere to salvage it."
rotten,"The movie will make you want to quit movies about video games, and perhaps video games as well."
rotten,"A rushed second half, struggling to explain certain character's storylines fails to make the film thrilling or fun. I would say watch ""Child's Play"" or ""MEGAN"" if you want to see a silly, but clever horror about products that shouldn't be coming to life."
rotten,...a milquetoast viewing experience...unable to determine just what kind of movie (this) truly wants this to be.
rotten,Video game adaptation teeters between serious horror and bloodless camp.
rotten,Casual moviegoers may enjoy the dynamic between Mike and Abby but shouldn’t expect much from the disjointed screenplay beyond the odd jump scare and perhaps some chuckles.
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy’s is a hodgepodge of a horror movie. The script and direction throw nearly the kitchen sink at the audience, but nothing feels fully fleshed out."
rotten,"Fans of the video game of the same name will know what’s possible in this spin-off movie, but anyone approaching it as just another horror film might be confounded."
fresh,[Five Nights at Freddy's] is a nice supernatural story that captures the sensations of Goosebumps and the '90s The Midnight Club for a multi-format generation that does not understand entertainment as a static window. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"With its mix of not-scary-enough horror and too-extensive backstory, this ends up feeling more like franchise maintenance than entertainment. It's a film that exists to further the brand rather than be enjoyable in its own right"
rotten,"While it is simply wrong to pass Five Nights at Freddy's off as being another lazy horror adaptation, the film is clearly a monstrous mess."
rotten,"Instead of catering to the in-built audience ready and waiting, ""Five Nights"" wastes time trying to win over people who couldn’t care less. As a result, what should’ve been an intricate, twisted, and absurd treat is demoted to generic horror movie sludge."
rotten,"It strains to erect a supernatural universe while neglecting to fulfill the basic promises of a scary film built on a gag premise, stretching its dreary tale of trauma to nearly two hours."
fresh,"""Five Nights at Freddy’s"" is a decent flick that provides entertainment and scares for younger and older generations. Is it without flaws in its story? No, but this supernatural horror is still fun to see."
rotten,I'm not sure why this movie was even made. The plot was all over the place and was overly predictable. I couldn't tell if I should laugh with it or at it.
fresh,Five Nights at Freddy's is a good adaptation of the video game of the same name that manages to keep the viewer tense throughout the entire show thanks to its creepy atmosphere and impressive special effects. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"If we ignore that this is supposed to be a horror film... on its own merit, the film is fun to watch. From start to finish we are taken on a journey that has emotional depth and connects us to the main characters."
fresh,"It’s an uneven scarefest, but the bloodthirst is at least refreshing."
fresh,"Though it may not be the film we asked for this Halloween weekend, it's refreshing to see Josh Hutcherson in a starring role again in this quirky horror fairytale."
fresh,"As it is, the movie seems best suited for those who prefer their scares within boundaries, and aren’t too concerned with plot logic."
fresh,Emma Tammi has done the unexpected. She made a tasty meal out of pre-packaged pizza dough when most folks were expecting Chuck E. Cheese-level quality.
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy's is awful. They didn't have anything for two hours, much less five nights."
fresh,"The seesaw definitely tips toward fan service, though there are some horror pleasures that anyone can appreciate."
rotten,"A horror film doesn’t have to be R rated to be good, but Five Nights at Freddy’s feels like 30 minutes of interesting ideas padded out to almost two hours"
rotten,"Based on the popular horror video games, this movie starts out well, with sympathetic characters, a fun design, and an appealing comical tone, but it goes on too long and eventually falls apart."
fresh,"It isn’t perfect, far from it, but try to tell that to the kids who love FNAF and they will have thousands of reasons why you are wrong."
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy's is a yawn and a half ... Sorry, Freddy. Back to the stage for you."
rotten,"Five Nights at Freddy's forgets to be fun or scary, limiting what genre effectiveness can be mustered up here."
rotten,Not fun enough. Not scary enough. It just exists.
fresh,Newcomers will appreciate that a PG-13 rated film isn’t afraid to kill kids and shred unwitting trespassers. Genre and game fans will howl with appreciation at the Easter eggs embedded throughout.
fresh,Five Nights at Freddy’s was overall a bit too long but pretty much an okay movie for the season and did right by its source material.
rotten,"Almost worth a recommendation, but when a film about animatronics killing has very little animatronics killing, many won't get their money's worth."
rotten,"The plot is as dingy and full of holes as a 10-year-old pair of underpants, and about as much fun to watch."
rotten,"For something that features an enormous robot chicken armed with a cupcake, [it's] an oddly serious, even dour movie."
rotten,Five Nights at Freddy’s commits the worst crime of all – it’s dull from beginning to end. It’s a frustrating miss on a premise and franchise that can be so much more.
rotten,"Hutcherson is admirably committed to the film-makers’ apparent desire to make something miserable of a scenario that, as one Oscar-winning actor has shown, is more accommodating of psychedelic comedy."
fresh,"[A] fun gateway horror film ... has [plot] holes bigger than a pizzeria ... but it’s a film where those of a certain age will jump and shriek at the right places, then laugh over how they survived."
rotten,"...a classic case of getting so carried away with other things that you shortchange what people are coming to see. More specifically, it gets bogged down in bland uninteresting drama rather than delivering the wacky animatronic horror it advertises."
fresh,"Five Nights At Freddy’s saving grace for it is that it’s immediately available on Peacock. While it may not live up to the ambition of the project or the IP, it is perfect for the Halloween season."
rotten,"Sloppy, boring and unscary, Five Nights at Freddy's is a big letdown. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"I hate singling out actors because bad movies are rarely their fault, but Hutcherson’s terrible performance is right at home in this stuffed dog of a thriller."
fresh,"Emma Tammi’s horror-mystery film isn’t perfect, but it’s compelling and scary enough to beg for sequels."
rotten,"Franchise devotees will find a little more traction here via inside-baseball references... Beyond that, the movie commits the indefensible crime of being no fun whatsoever."
rotten,"... A movie that is somewhat schematic in its development, superficial, and remains halfway throughout. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,It’s a fun gateway horror movie for kids—and the easily scared who want to test their limits lightly.
fresh,"This is gateway horror, and it’s pretty damn fun gateway horror at that. But the “PG-13 horror is inherently evil” crowd will no doubt walk away deeply disappointed. A solid effort that underdelivers in some areas but exceeds expectations in others."
rotten,I was more bored than scared.
fresh,"It has a great look and feels true to the game, but it is a bit overwritten to add a story to otherwise mundane game play."
rotten,"Josh Hutcherson is good as Mike but aside from that, viewers will be longing to see “Game Over” flash on cinema screens."
rotten,"Though deadly robots and spooky kids would each be frightening enough alone without them teaming up, somehow, when they’re together here, they’re not that scary or much fun."
rotten,"This movie is absolutely terrible. It is slow, it is not scary, it is not funny. It's just not a well done movie."
rotten,"Like Teletubbies with chainsaws, or knife-wielding Fimbles, it’s absurd. But not in a good way."
rotten,"Yet while there’s enough ambient dread in this “Five Nights at Freddy’s” feature to indicate why the video games are so popular, there’s more by-the-numbers plotting than needed."
rotten,"Five Nights At Freddy’s is a strange film, uneven in tone, encumbered by a very grown-up serial killer plot and disastrously lacking a sense of humour."
rotten,Five Nights At Freddy's is four nights too many.
fresh,The only real caveat is the horror is diluted since the film needed to maintain a PG rating for maximum box office.
rotten,"Deep inside, there's a good movie here. But a muddied script littered with tonal and story issues keeps it from being anything memorable."
rotten,Surely Chuck E. Cheese and Freddy Krueger are sharing a sinister laugh about it right now. (mini-review)
fresh,"Championing psychological horror over bloodletting gore lowers the rating but ups the ante... a decent translation to the screen, almost ninety percent of what fans expect with a couple of twists."
rotten,"The film seems rather unsure of its identity, half-heartedly attempting to be scary and funny, and ultimately succeeding at neither."
rotten,"The premise, meantime, of “Five Nights at Freddy’s” is entirely about the cruelty, and very likely would’ve made more sense as a straight-up R-rated splatterfest."
rotten,It's about as generic as it gets.
rotten,Five Nights at Freddy’s is the latest film to proclaim itself a scary movie but ends up approaching the genre with such trepidation that the result is a bland tale that is neither scary nor funny enough to at least make it [amusing].
rotten,"Unfortunately, this adaptation of the popular 2014 video game fails at delivering scares or cheeky laughs, resulting in a tedious experience that relies heavily on horror’s most cliched tropes."
rotten,"The monsters are beautifully designed by the Jim Henson Creature Shop, but this joyless shocker never whirs into life."
fresh,"Creepy rather than scary, and more a ghost story than a monster movie, this has a good heart but feels a little toothless for something with so many killer robots."
rotten,"A five-person writing team (including the game's creator) has conjured what ""The Vanishing"" or ""Prisoners"" might look like were it produced by Showbiz Pizza and mandated to subliminally promote purchasing a birthday pizza party package every 10 minutes."
rotten,"The kind of hollowed-out exercise in atrociousness that pretty much forces you to mull other things, be they what you’re having for dinner, the decline of American community, or the heat death of the universe."
rotten,"If the crowd I watched the film with is any indication, Five Nights at Freddy’s will likely satisfy those who know Freddy Fazbear and his maniacal cohorts. If my personal experience is any indication, newcomers will be by turns underwhelmed and bored."
rotten,"In the game, the players are Mike, and the goal is not to get killed. The pace is speedy, the threats are many. It’s all about staying alive. The problem for the movie audience is staying awake."
rotten,"Despite an authentic production design that brings the world to vivid life and stupendous animatronics from the Jim Henson Creature Shop, the movie has no sense of direction or rhythm."
rotten,"Dour and depressing, all about buried traumas and child endangerment in both the past and present."
fresh,"Mitchell, Thompson, Howery, and Bell are all comical in their over-the-top roles, though Mitchell's Ed is funnier if viewed as single-minded rather than just simple (or even intellectually challenged)."
rotten,It’s the same order inside new packaging that you may or may not still have a taste for.
rotten,"The script is a bit sharper than the first, as there are some ideas on its mind concerning automation and employment conditions. It doesn’t delve too deeply into these things, but it at least fills the 90-minute runtime with some worthwhile toppings."
fresh,"And it mostly maintains the stoopid spirit of the original. It seems to maintain it, anyway – its success is wholly contingent on one’s standing affection for the first movie..."
fresh,Good Burger 2 sticks to the hits but matures enough to not seem weirdly juvenile. It comes off as endearing and nostalgic fun.
rotten,"All in all, it’s worth a watch if you are a fan of the original but it is a very forgettable movie that won’t leave much of an impression."
fresh,Flavors of Nickelodeon and the show All That come back strong with a film that's equal parts nostalgia and nutty. Grade B-
rotten,"To update the story to 2023, the filmmakers add a few new characters and a tiresome AI plot, winding up with a Thanksgiving diversion that functions just fine playing in the background as families gather for their holiday meals."
rotten,"It is a petrified Happy Meal buried in the back of your childhood closet, reheated in the microwave. Good Burger 2 will give the most nostalgic customer food poisoning."
fresh,Everyone involved in the making of Good Burger 2 seem like they really care about this world and these characters. Ed (Kel Mitchell) and Dexter (Kenan Thompson) are a throwback to classic comedy duos like Abbott and Costello & Laurel and Hardy.
rotten,"Good Burger 2 does its best to recapture the magic, but it sadly doesn’t do the original film justice. It’s a goofy sequel that doesn’t stick the landing or even have a strong enough story to carry through."
fresh,"Fans of the 1997 effort should be pleased with this revival, which finds its groove quickly and wisely puts Mitchell and Thompson back in charge of silliness."
fresh,"Good Burger 2 tastes exactly how you remembered it, and it’s made with the same love and care of how it was crafted all those years ago."
rotten,"There are some goofy puns, non sequiturs, and absurdist jokes that land... The rest of the comedy is primarily listless reheating, and anyone looking for a visual hit of nostalgia may be disappointed."
fresh,"Good Burger and All That aimed their humor directly at kids too young for the grown-up stuff — or, at least, the ones too young to tell their parents they watched it in secret. This movie works on that same wavelength."
fresh,"Good Burger 2 certainly isn’t a masterpiece, but Kenan & Kel still have the special sauce that makes this film work."
rotten,"For a while, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” feels as though it may be heading somewhere truly interesting, but, instead, it becomes a bit waterlogged."
rotten,"I was sitting back in my seat, nowhere near the edge of it. I would have liked to have inched towards the edge of it."
fresh,"This is a very suspenseful film, at times unpleasantly so."
rotten,"It's ironic that much of The Marsh King's Daughter takes place in a backwoods marsh area, because this entire movie is a soggy mess. It starts off as a monotonous drama and devolves into a series of silly action scenes that don't look believable."
fresh,"Ridley feels challenged in the right ways, while Mendelsohn channels another scummy character to strong effect. The stakes are just high enough to have kept me involved, and that’s fine for a decent paperback come-to-life situation."
fresh,"There’s nothing especially surprising about the way the film wraps up, but it still packs a mild punch, thanks to Ridley’s cold stare, borne of childhood trauma."
rotten,A potent premise and earnest performances from Daisy Ridley and Ben Mendelsohn are let down by an under-written screenplay that submits to the temptations of its genre.
fresh,"The tale is too tame, its savagery held too much in check to truly hold the audience in its thrall."
rotten,"It might make for a better book but The Marsh King’s Daughter is a stiff and stuffy thriller, lacking in a tighter script, and any true energy to dig itself out of the mud."
fresh,"While the premise of The Marsh King's Daughter is rich with the possibility for how introspectively deep the story could go, it doesn't manage to get there."
rotten,"Rather than keeping us guessing or catching us by surprise, the movie goes the more conventional route, leading to an ending that's as far-fetched as it is predictable."
rotten,"After a promising opening, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” quickly falls into a predictable and monotonous slog, plodding along toward an inevitable confrontation between father and daughter."
fresh,"On the positive side, the acting is good and the atmospheric setting is visually pleasing."
rotten,"Carried by a solid cast, The Marsh King’s Daughter tackles its intriguing premise in a competent fashion but never rises above the level of Lifetime thriller."
rotten,"For a thriller to work, you have to guess what's gonna happen, but the minute he [Mendelsohn] escapes from prison you just know exactly what's going to happen. This is a formulaic, predictable thriller."
rotten,It doesn’t take much of a survival instinct to sense that this should be avoided at all costs
rotten,"It's part psychological drama, part thriller, but not an effective whole. ... includes some on-the-nose dialogue for the more-than-capable cast."
rotten,"What starts as an atmospheric, introspective melodrama about fractured family bonds and primal instincts transitions into a formulaic cat-and-mouse saga about paranoia and past secrets."
fresh,"While the opening and closing acts are strong, the middle section sags. Still, “The Marsh King’s Daughter” is a competent, unnerving thriller."
rotten,"When we need the churning dread of an intimate tale of generational trauma, The Marsh King’s Daughter goes formulaic, and when we’re primed for exploitation sweats, it gets flabby."
fresh,"It’s the remarkable cast that saves the day for the film. Daisy Ridley delivers a controlled and haunting performance as Helena, a character deeply scarred by her traumatic past."
rotten,"While the first third establishes the premise with a lot of promise and a compelling backstory, the rest of the film can’t rise above perfunctory cat-and-mouse dynamics that lack urgency and emotional stakes."
rotten,"The film’s pacing sags, undercutting the sense of urgency that makes a thriller."
rotten,"Fans of Ridley will want to check this out for her, because there’s not much suspense to be found elsewhere."
rotten,It's almost inevitable—and just as disappointing—that The Marsh King's Daughter takes the third-act turn that it does.
rotten,Even the more genre-inflected marsh-girl movies have conducted themselves with a little too much decorum—a polite way of saying they take a cheesily therapeutic approach to the lookie-loo pulp they’re peddling.
fresh,"Burger remembers the strength of his opening when father and daughter return to the woods in the last third, and it’s worth the wait."
rotten,"A dull, shallow and underwhelming psychological thriller."
rotten,The Marsh King’s Daughter is a lackluster adaptation of a best-selling novel.
rotten,"The two sides of the endeavor don’t snap together, leaving the viewing experience uneven and the conclusion unsatisfying."
fresh,A powerful story about the psychological hold one person can have on another.
fresh,"With strong performances, the dawdling pace prevents the narrative from fully being realized, but it manages to maintain interest until the very end."
fresh,"Neil Burger’s newest film isn’t revolutionary in its storytelling, nor does it keep us guessing how it’ll end. Still, it features a twisty and unexpected intro and solid performances from talented cast members."
rotten,'The Marsh King's Daughter' is yet another addition to the forgotten library of inconsequential and underdeveloped action thrillers.
rotten,The movie is so afraid of making viewers restless that it shies away from dramatizing anything it can’t resolve in 20 seconds or less.
fresh,B-movie material elevated by A-level performances.
rotten,"Once the film turns into a paranoid home-invasion thriller, there’s no ambiguity left to the tale."
fresh,"The Marsh King’s Daughter doesn’t really have much more on its mind than just serving as an effective thriller, but it achieves its goals thanks to an outstanding cast that makes it all work, and a filmmaker who navigates it all in style."
rotten,"While Ridley gives her all to a more thoughtful and nuanced performance, The Marsh King's Daughter remains a film on a directionless journey to nowhere. Even with the commitment of its lead, it just gets lost in the woods before falling flat on its face."
fresh,"The settings, the striking cinematography, sharp, suspense-heightening editing of the action beats and the stars lead this Marsh King's Daughter out of the swamp."
rotten,It feels ironic that a movie about magic and wishing doesn't feel all that magical.
fresh,"Genie's messages of valuing your loved ones and being unselfish are on point for the holiday season, and this film should have no trouble finding an audience year-round. But, it could have been so much more."
rotten,Genie just didn’t have enough left in the bottle to make it a successful holiday hit.
fresh,"It's unlikely to become a holiday classic. But the performances are engaging and often even amusing. And while the story feels badly contrived, is cheerful enough to lift the spirits."
rotten,Richard Curtis returns to heap further cinematic misery on Christmas movie fans with Genie.
rotten,C-
rotten,"Unfortunately, this Peacock original contains few laughs, little Christmas spirit, and a complete lack of originality."
rotten,"While Curtis’ original 1991 film was a commentary on the commercialization of Christmas, this Genie does not have anything to say other than to make sure you are not late for important moments in your life. And don’t eat hand sanitizer."
fresh,"Alan Cumming brings the right touch as Bernard’s awful and vain boss, but this is Essiedu’s opportunity to shine, and does he ever take full advantage of it."
rotten,"Critiquing the very thing it also sets out to do, Genie is the movie equivalent of a dog chasing its own tail, but is (barely) saved from the wrapping-paper pile by the amiable chemistry of its stars."
fresh,What a pleasant surprise with a very funny script from Richard Curtis and charming performance from McCarthy
rotten,"The film’s ending manages to pull things together nicely, thanks to a bit of a cheat, and gives both Bernard and Flora the endings that both deserve, and one that doesn’t completely fall on its face is the greatest gift of all."
rotten,Melissa McCarthy’s charisma brings some zany comic energy to this otherwise innocuous and predictable tale of holiday redemption.
rotten,"[McCarthy is] the quipster caffeine in “Genie,” but over the years she has perked up too many second-rate, throwaway comedies, and this, I’m afraid, is one more of them."
rotten,Put it back in the bottle.
rotten,A new Peacock movie that’s genuinely likable for a while before you realize it’s run out of new ideas and has no clue where to go with the ones it has left.
fresh,"“Genie” is not a powerful viewing experience, and comedic value is tested at times, but it’s gentle work with a pleasing Christmas atmosphere."
rotten,"It’s as if everyone involved is terrified of actually making people laugh in case that gives offence somehow, or disrupts the algorithmic calculation that theoretically makes this a palatable piece of content."
rotten,"Fantasy movies are of course free to be far-fetched, but some of the plot turns here are so wide as to suggest shrugging contempt... Also, the flying carpet special effects are lousy."
fresh,"Essiedu brings plenty of emotional depth to the put-upon Bernard, though he's ultimately the straight man to McCarthy, who delivers a joyously over-the-top performance as the magical fish-out-of-water."
fresh,"For all of its joys, the holiday season can be a time of comparison, envy, and heartache, and Best. Christmas. Ever! portrays that in a really thought-provoking and realistic way as it reminds us that no life or person is as perfect as it may seem."
rotten,"More of a holiday concept than legit film, Netflix’s flimsy and phony offering flounders around and strands Heather Graham and pop singer/actor Brandy Norwood, not to mention Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeno, in the cinematic equivalent of a lump of coal."
fresh,"Best.Christmas.Ever! might have an ambitious title, but its sweet message and heartfelt message of appreciation will win over most Scrooges."
fresh,"This is a film that probably reads better on paper than it plays on screen due to some awkward pacing and clunky editing, but a more serious second half allows for a heartwarming ending."
rotten,I gave Best. Christmas. Ever! my undivided attention. What I found was an uncanny valley-esque experience that I have to confess I found difficult to translate into the usual form of what we humans know as a ‘film review’.
rotten,"It's still early in the season, but all viewers should want for Christmas is that Best. Christmas. Ever! won’t be the best holiday title on offer."
fresh,"Best. Christmas. Ever! is nothing more than a light-hearted comedy, made to be watched with the family and presumably while we put up the Christmas tree. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The title of the movie feels ironic here, when it's probably closer to being one of the worst Christmas movies ever."
rotten,"The best you can say for this — aside from Netflix finding work for older writers and directors — is that it’s shiny, childish background noise that might keep a child distracted long enough for adults to get a turkey in the oven"
fresh,[Brandy and Heather Graham] explore their character’s strained female friendship with care and nuance. These over-the-top Christmas shenanigans will make you grateful for what you have and for the people around you… with a pinch of Santa’s magic too.
rotten,It’s a bit presumptuous (and maybe even intentionally ironic) to title a movie Best. Christmas. Ever! (Nov. 16) when the film itself falls below the standard of even the most mediocre of the streamer’s original holiday movies.
rotten,It’s as artificial as an aluminum Christmas tree. “Best. Christmas. Ever!” isn’t the worst movie ever…but it’s close.
rotten,"Best. Christmas. Ever! is not the most splendiferous Christmas movie ever, but it will satisfy those hungry for new sentimental holiday movies."
fresh,"Christmas films should be filled with magic, hope, and all the trimming and traditions to get you in the holiday spirit. Best. Christmas. Ever! does this with its colorful sets, intense decorations, huge snowfalls, and family traditions."
fresh,"Its absurdist lunacy acts as a Trojan Horse containing genuinely meaningful sentiments on forgiveness, happiness and bittersweet sorrows — universalities people tend to reflect on as their year comes to a close."
rotten,"“Best. Christmas. Ever!” resembles a television holiday special more than a feature film, and its plot follows the predictable Christmastime themes of love, acceptance, and being thankful for what you’ve got."
rotten,"At less than 80 minutes, it’s barely even a movie, more one long montage of bits that never run on long enough to be defined as scenes."
rotten,"Norwood fans hoping for something as hard-hitting as any random episode of “Moesha” will be disappointed, but she does a nice duet of “Let It Snow” with Biggs and sings another pleasant carol over the closing credits."
fresh,"Its message is an important one and one that will resonate with many, even if the delivery takes a while to fall into place."
rotten,"Unfortunately, Please Don't Destroy's first feature-length film offers a painfully predictable story and fails to elicit almost any laughs."
rotten,"Maybe this film is destined to be a cult classic, or maybe it will be relegated to more streaming platform filler."
rotten,"There are some laugh-out-loud moments you won’t be able to resist, but it just gets sloppy in the end"
fresh,"[Please Don't Destroy: The Legend of Foggy Mountain] is awkward, ridiculous fun from some fresh voices, and the best SNL-produced comedy to come along in decades."
rotten,"I mostly found myself giggling through the movie, and I think that’s as much as the creators could hope for from someone who enjoys Please Don’t Destroy in small doses on SNL but isn’t sure their sensibilities translate into a feature film."
fresh,...an entertaining-enough debut for a trio of exceedingly promising comedy stars.
rotten,"If anything, it feels apt to refer to The Treasure of Foggy Mountain as their “not ready for primetime” attempt to deliver a feature capitalizing off their chemistry and sense of humor."
fresh,"With Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, they toe the line between teen boy humor (fart jokes, vulgar sexual references) and genuine messages about friendship and manhood."
rotten,"With their uneven feature vehicle Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, the three decamp to small-town North Carolina as doofuses far outside showbiz, though “Ben,” “Martin,” and “John” remain suspended in a state of arrested adolescence."
rotten,"“The Treasure of Foggy Mountain,” while having its share of laugh-out-loud moments and trademark bizarre humor, is primarily a lifeless mess, just not really connecting in any meaningful way and often just too silly to function in a movie form."
fresh,"Please Don’t Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain has way more laughs than the standard direct-to-streaming comedy, with some gloriously silly running gags and hilarious non sequiturs. But it lacks any real point of view behind that silliness."
fresh,The movie fully embraces how much fun it is to watch people who understand each other on a molecular level.
rotten,"While there are plenty of laughs along the trio’s journey, PDD reminds us why it’s been over a decade since the last SNL feature-length project."
rotten,"There’s obviously some talent at work here, but not much in the way of stretching, and the initial energy and sheer dorkiness doesn’t generate enough laughs to sustain a movie."
fresh,"With incredible performances, high-quality jokes, and ambitious production, the movie is a worthwhile adventure that centers on the value of friendship. In the end, you’re bound to be craving more from the comedy trio!"
rotten,This one is more forgettable than it could have been but also nowhere near the disaster that often comes when members of Lorne Michaels' troupe are allowed out during the day.
fresh,"The comedy Please Don't Destroy: The Treasure of Foggy Mountain is a hit-or-miss affair, but one that hits slightly more than it misses."
fresh,"Ultimately, that's what The Treasure of Foggy Mountain is: pure dumb fun, albeit with some awkward dead spots."
rotten,"Sketch comedy tends to work because you don’t have to spend more than a few minutes at a time with exaggerated caricatures of human beings. This type of humor rarely translates well in a full feature, and this film is proof of that."
fresh,"A strong feature-length debut for Please Don’t Destroy, mostly proving they can handle the run time and remain fresh with their comedic targets, and their high-energy, good-natured nonsense is great fun to watch."
rotten,Can an act who does their best work in two-minute bursts hold our attention for an hour and a half? Sort of.
fresh,I don’t know how long the boys can keep tapping the well of their surreal imaginations before they become exhausting. But I do know that The Treasure of Foggy Mountain made me laugh so hard I missed a number of jokes.
fresh,A diverting enough entertainment from a group that has repeatedly proven itself to be capable of much more.
rotten,"The frustrating thing is that Marshall, Herlihy and especially Higgins really are funny, and the film has some huge laughs. That’s enough for a sketch show. It’s not quite enough for a film."
rotten,"As comedy writers and movie actors, the members of Please Don’t Destroy – Martin Herlihy, John Higgins and Ben Marshall – are out of their depth."
rotten,"Alas, the comedic momentum and near-absurd energy don't last..."
rotten,"“‘The Treasure of Foggy Mountain’ doesn’t match the quality of mid-level Adam Sandler comedies, but it just may work as a double-billing with Akiva Schaffer’s 2007 film ‘Hot Rod’ starring Andy Samberg…”"
fresh,"Please Don't Destroy's debut film isn't necessarily a treasure, but there are a few gems to make the future look solid for this trio."
rotten,"The first act of the Paul Briganti-directed feature succeeds in large part to this easygoing dynamic. Once the story stretches, the thinness of its premise shows through and writing goes from loose to sloppy, charming to grating."
rotten,"While the group’s short SNL videos are often quite amusing, this feature-length venture doesn’t do them any favors."
rotten,"Come for the simulated bumping and grinding, stay for the ridiculous drama, stilted acting, hilarious soundtrack, and laughably offensive ideas about male and female desire."
rotten,This repugnant Fifty Shades knockoff plays like an erotic rewrite of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.
rotten,"The Room meets Beauty and the Beast, 50 Shades of Grey and the stockholm syndrome in this cheesy erotic thriller with not a single positive aspect about it. Why such a product is Netflix's top movie of 2020 baffles almost everyone."
rotten,If you find yourself watching this make zero expectations. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"It's the kind of movie you fast forward to get to all the good parts, only to realize that there are no good parts."
rotten,"It's only on the strength of its looking-good-naked leads and their palpable hot people chemistry that the film remains perversely watchable, though at two hours it's more an exercise in cinematic self-flagellation than high-trash entertainment."
rotten,"Like a big-budget porn film with dramatically thinned out narrative and character development, a bunch of unambiguously abusive ""foreplay"" added in, and all of the hardcore elements taken out."
rotten,Sex domination fantasy is graphic and violent.
rotten,There haven't been line readings this poor since the third act of The Room...
rotten,The problem lies in the fact that the makers of 365 Days counter every morally incorrect step with a self-aware one.
rotten,"Strictly for those wondering, ""what would a straight-up ripoff of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' look like if it were made in Poland?"""
rotten,A porn movie is more honest than this trash. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"365 DNI romanticizes an extremely toxic relationship, which is never okay."
rotten,"Thoroughly terrible, politically objectionable, occasionally hilarious..."
rotten,"The movie pretty much cops every move made by 50 Shades, as if it were a bible of antisexy awfulness."
rotten,"A ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" kidnapping porn mafia picture - softcore, of course"
rotten,"Reptile lets all the drama happen off screen with a third act deus ex machina. What could have been a knotty, suburban, coastal noir boils down to a detective story we’ve all seen before."
fresh,"This is a dreary and somewhat tense crime drama that features a fascinating and compelling lead performance. Del Toro crushes it, but the mystery surrounding his character doesn’t quite come together as intended"
rotten,Excellent performances aren’t enough to salvage this labyrinthine slog saturated with equal parts premeditated diversion and gloomy atmosphere. Not even del Toro can make this work.
rotten,"Though the film’s plot, including its resolution, is routine, Del Toro and Silverstone keep things interesting. I’d love to see them return as these characters in a more compelling story."
fresh,A pretty effective murder mystery... [Benicio Del Toro] has aged very nicely into this sort of role.
fresh,"Eventually, Reptile becomes tangled and leaves some of its subplots as loose ends, but Singer’s film is an impressively solid and slimy procedural."
rotten,"What begins as a taut crime story ends as anything but. In fact, the finale leaves a couple of questions unanswered."
fresh,"Grant Singer puts in plenty of nice touches to stress a seedy environment, and del Toro gets a lot of lived-in aspects to his role to play with, but the film still can’t entirely shed the feel of being a “lesser than” attempt at a strong cinematic effort."
fresh,"Reptile, whose name is never fully explained, packs quite a lot into the fast-moving story, though at over two hours, it could have been condensed more."
rotten,"It's too convoluted and it feels like a low-rent ""True Detective"". At the heart of it, it could have been fantastic, but the execution of this film was poorly done."
fresh,"Reptile shines in various aspects, and its flaws can easily be overlooked. Watch it for Del Toro's compelling performance and Fincher's influence (particularly in the first half)."
fresh,"Some leaps of logic lessen a well acted, twisty thriller."
rotten,"Sadly, you still need to stick the landing, and Reptile does a good job of drawing us into the mystery, it just rushes the ending and that feels like a crime."
rotten,"Gets points for holding your interest, but loses them for botching the close...it twists itself into such pretzel formations in an attempt to surprise that by the end the ludicrousness has overwhelmed the mood it worked so hard to establish."
fresh,"Benicio Del Toro makes this whole thing work. If it were an hour and a half, it'd be a 4-star. At it's current unwieldy length, it's a 3-star. Still a good watch."
rotten,"""Reptile"" isn't a terrible film. There will be a specific crowd that enjoys it. There are just better offerings out there."
fresh,"A very absorbing whodunnit procedural assembled with cooly unnerving aplomb, like a David Fincher thriller."
fresh,"Frustratingly, the underlying themes aren't robust enough to make this vastly overlong film very memorable, rehashing the usual exhausted good cop scenario. It's beautifully shot and acted, but a bit more earthy momentum would have given it a real kick."
rotten,"Del Toro’s solid screen charisma can’t rescue Reptile, a derivative and lethargic thriller that rarely thrills as it tries and fails to build a case for itself as a meaningful iteration on the detective thrillers that it admires."
rotten,After a fast start the middle part falters.
rotten,"Like the snake of its title, it slithers ominously enough to send some shivers up the spine. But it’s also a bit too slow and deliberate for its own good, even if its venomous bite can draw some blood."
rotten,Benicio del Toro is unsurprising but constantly watchable. It helps that the character’s marriage avoids cop-movie clichés by being fairly happy.
rotten,"And in the aimless comings and goings, Reptiles becomes increasingly less attractive. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The film has a concise script, which gradually opens rifts for us to find out along with Tom, from the armchair at home, what is behind the real estate business. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The fallout from all this purposeful gloom isn't merely that nothing surprises us; even Del Toro's committed portrayal of a careful man's gathering disillusionment gets jammed up.
rotten,"It's perfectly watchable, but let it play on during the bathroom breaks and search for snacks. It's so slow you probably won't miss anything vital, not until the third act."
rotten,If it more closely focused on Del Toro & Silverstone's mutual deductions on the crimes at hand it may have had something. Instead it feels like all those twisty thrillers in the wake of The Usual Suspects until you're wondering what was all that about.
fresh,"Del Toro, who worked on the script crafted by director Grant Singer and Benjamin Brewer, has a meaty role that – like much of the cast – plays him against type."
fresh,"It’s handsomely made with strong, committed performances, but it plays so closely to the blueprint that it never establishes an identity of its own."
fresh,Benicio Del Toro's magnetic presence is captivating in an atmospheric slow burn that satisfies more as a crime thriller than as a murder mystery. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Del Toro is understated & withdrawn, expertly capturing an inquisitive detective with a damaged past. While the reveal of the mystery does arrive too soon, reducing the impact of the finale, everything that comes before it is riveting with uneasy tension."
rotten,"A meandering, routine, mundane slog creating an illusion of thrills when, in reality, nothing interesting is happening"
rotten,...stellar acting alone can’t mask most of the shortcomings in Reptile.
fresh,"Del Toro carries this sometimes convoluted and derivative thriller into three-star territory with an absolutely mesmerizing and authentic performance that conjures up memories of past anti-hero greats such as Bogart and Mitchum, Ryan and Hayden."
fresh,"... The most eccentric character, Michael Pitt's sort of Neo-grunge man with psychopathic traits, makes some of the scenes in the just over two hours sufficiently attractive and inspired to help us get through the end. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Though at times entertaining, the movie fails to escape the shadows of its influences and leaves us with the sensation of a wasted opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Benicio del Toro's understated performance as a soft-spoken detective is about the only interesting thing about this new Netflix thriller, which drowns a thin murder mystery in lots of ominous atmosphere."
rotten,"The circuitous plotting is hampered by unlikely coincidences that mount before the tangled finale, as Singer's initially promising pulp-noir character piece is buckled by its loftier pretensions."
rotten,"This slick and atmospheric murder mystery is best when it’s more about the investigator than the investigation. However, all the melodramatic twists and narrative misdirection can’t disguise the underlying familiarity of the material."
rotten,"There is a strange character study yearning to break out of the new Netflix thriller ""Reptile,"" made all the more baffling by the fact that the movie surrounding this character study is a fairly stale crime drama."
fresh,Del Toro and Silverstone make a meal out of what tends to be a pro forma side to these kinds of thrillers
fresh,"A good-looking, engaging B-movie made with uncommon intelligence. Music video director Grant Singer’s feature debut is no perfect object, but it is decidedly, and often successfully, aspiring to be something more than just toss-off streaming content."
rotten,"Easily the worst big budget detective thriller since The Snowman a few years back, Reptile eventually lures the viewer in by making them question how this could’ve gone so wrong given the talent involved."
rotten,It's easy to admire how Reptile attempts to do things a bit differently  ... It's also easy to begrudge this movie's eventual shift toward the routinely straightforward and the unnecessarily convoluted.
rotten,"Reptile gets an extra edge thanks to its rock-solid cast and sufficiently gripping mystery, but it never coalesces into anything incredible."
rotten,"Less ""whodunit"", more ""who cares?"""
fresh,"Reptile’s main strength is del Toro. He shares great chemistry with Silverstone, his co-star in 1997’s Excess Baggage, but it is his character's combination of tenaciousness and eccentricity that are the movie’s most original components."
rotten,"Once the film gets around to revealing the culprit, we have already lost interest, enervated in the face of a movie that, like an overeager snake, bites off far more than it can swallow."
fresh,"Reptile is an atmospheric Southern crime thriller dripping with an ominous and obsessive style that gradually seeps under the skin, keeping the viewer on edge and making them uneasy."
fresh,"Del Toro doesn’t disappoint. Humorous, serious, determined."
fresh,"A solid, gloomy detective thriller that works thanks to Benicio del Toro's stellar performance and the slimy, moody atmosphere created by first-time director Grant Singer. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Elements work in “Reptile,” especially police brotherhood material, but it doesn’t add up to much in this underwhelming study of crime and punishment (and faucets)."
fresh,What sets it apart is the strange and slightly offbeat vibe that permeates the entire movie. “Reptile” is very much a crime thriller. But (Grant) Singer takes it in some peculiar and even darkly funny directions.
rotten,"Reptile feels as though it’s been through an especially ruthless edit, and it carries the scars of trying to distill a tense tapestry about corruption and morality into something streamlined and easily digestible."
rotten,"A distended dirge of digressions & dream sequences that never distract from equally superficial murder plots & psychological profiles. With respect to Benicio Del Toro & Alicia Silverstone’s previous collaboration, ""Excess Baggage"" makes more sense here."
rotten,"Reptile, from its score to its performances, is all mood and little else."
fresh,The bulky physical presence of Del Toro himself gives the film its momentum and force.
fresh,“Reptile” tugs you along with a competent and accessible intrigue.
fresh,REPTILE is a murder mystery that packs enough twists and turns to keep even the best amateur sleuth guessing.
fresh,The suspense in REPTILE is sustained throughout. The film is an intelligently written murder whodunit that will keep audiences guessing until the very end.
rotten,"Such tension ultimately unravels during a latter half that rushes through too many underwhelming revelations, but that’s not enough to completely offset the film’s beguiling air of despondency."
rotten,Reptile just feels wayward and listless.
fresh,"Every other actor in the movie — from Timberlake, to Eric Bogosian as Nichols’ boss, to Domenick Lombardozzi as his colleague — seems to have been cast as an irresistible force to be thrown against Del Toro’s immovable object."
fresh,The screenwriting trio often leans on perceptions initiated by characters and the actors playing them to present a watchable whodunnit after the early and brutal murder of a real estate agent (Matilda Lutz).
rotten,"Reptile is something of a noble misfire, willing to take risks with the genre and its expectations even if the end result leaves a bit to be desired."
fresh,"This sleek and noirish whodunit-slash-police procedural is a showcase for Benicio Del Toro but it's incredibly twisty, both a strength and a weakness."
rotten,"At the heart of Reptile lies Del Toro’s stellar, captivating performance…[but]what remains is a bloated, maximalist exercise in pastiche, one that is stupidly easy to decipher."
fresh,“Reptile” coils itself into many unexpected crevasses.
rotten,Characters exist for no reason other than to be suspicious.
rotten,"Some elements are overdone, strong decisions are replaced by bad ones, and the final act is a disaster.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It is a long and boring film, with few other respites from the tedium, but Del Toro, for whatever reason, is just captivating."
rotten,Reptile is an empty vessel lacking the creativity to elevate this first feature amongst a stellar year of directorial debuts.
fresh,"Offers enough deceit, red herrings, needle drops, and superb character work to make it rise about the usual Netflix suspects."
fresh,"Reptile is a suspenseful, clever, and visually stunning piece of work."
rotten,"In “Reptile” the density is less satisfying than it is irritating. A good thriller can go in lots of different directions, but it should never be this tiresome."
rotten,"Attempting to be a sleek thriller befitting of ""The Departed,"" the movie sputters out of control set to the tune of an ear-pinching score by Yair Elazar Glotman."
fresh,"A quirky, darkly comic cop thriller with a knockout performance from Benicio del Toro."
rotten,"Grant Singer’s feature directorial debut suffers from an overinflated sense of grandeur and a frustratingly convoluted story, reaching for dramatic heights that it hasn’t earned."
rotten,"In an effort to prove its cleverness, Reptile clanks, rattles and stumbles in its second half. The tricks that initially impressed eventually become hard to endure."
rotten,Reptile is a compelling police procedural until it overstays its welcome.
rotten,"Wants to be a David Fincher procedural with Steven Soderbergh’s paranoia, but it is a merely fangless homage without suspense, logic, or shame."
fresh,"If Reptile sounds like a familiar story to you, that’s because it is. It’s not aspiring to reinvent the crime thriller, and it really doesn’t need to."
rotten,"Rodriguez's spirit and good intentions seem to have been lost among medium budgets —but perhaps not quite generous enough— excessive seriousness, and convoluted plots in a sort of $65 million B-movie with Nolan-esque aspirations."
rotten,"A laughably bad, poorly acted movie. When nothing is real or as it seems, and you can’t trust anything you see happening, who cares? I certainly didn’t."
rotten,Hypnotic is essentially a B-grade product disguised as a smart movie. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Essentially “Lobster Stuffed with Tacos: The Movie.”
rotten,"A narratively inert film that, despite having good performances, an appropriately intense soundtrack, and intriguing ideas, simply doesn't know what it wants. The only thing that “Hypnotic” manages to do is CONFUSE the viewer. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,[Rodriguez] quickly reaches a dead end that leads him to have to explain each next step of the action with too many words. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Hypnotic is another Robert Rodríguez movie with its feet firmly planted on the ground when it's time to shoot, but with its head in the stratosphere when conceiving the script, scenes, and dialogues. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Rodríguez accumulates multiple situations, each one more absurd than the one before, which he intertwines with some action scenes resolved with much more skill than that applied to addressing poor Affleck's exploits. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Let those of us who accept the real unreality of a Raymond Chandler Philip K. Dick, enjoy a Ben Affleck playing a metatemporal detective... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The film articulates itself as a theory of mental power made from twists and turns that require a course final explanation. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,A poorly-written attempt at cerebral science fiction that collapses under the weight of its own stupidity.
rotten,"It doesn’t even lean into its absurdity, blowing an opportunity to pitch a tent in Campville and inspire a few hoots."
rotten,"You can only chip away at reality so far until everything in 'Hypnotic' starts to feel sketched and feckless. Any type of resolution reads as either disingenuous or completely unearned, as viewers were never invested in the journeys in the first place."
rotten,"At one point, [Diana] tells Rourke that “pain keeps the mind awake” — and, while the excruciating script doesn’t seem to have that effect on Affleck, it’s hard not to find yourself a little enlivened by Hypnotic’s sheer absurdity."
rotten,"""Hypnotic"" is just not a worthwhile endeavor for audiences as the actors almost seem to not believe in the material. There's a better film somewhere here, but it's not the one we've been given."
fresh,"There were some plot holes, but I still had a fun time with it."
rotten,To many ideas that make everything an uninteresting story...
rotten,Un-original in parts and a confusing storyline do not make for good watching… this is one too avoid.
rotten,"Hypnotic is as misleading as everything you see on the screen. I couldn’t help feeling bluffed in the end, sadly realizing how empty this experience was."
rotten,The film's ambitious scope and stylised action can't make up for a far-fetched script that's full of derivative dialogue.
rotten,This is what happens when a less-talented director tries to make a Christopher Nolan movie.
rotten,"There’s a solid game of cat-and-mouse in there somewhere... As it inevitably switches gears into sci-fi territory, the story loses sight of that, devolving into a ludicrous conspiracy and a tiresome version of Inception’s Spinning Top."
fresh,"This movie is messing with the characters minds and yours too, in a very entertaining way."
rotten,There’s no balance in Hypnotic. It’s all bad. The only saving grace is that the movie bucks the modern trend of overlong run times and winds up after a blessed ninety-three minutes.
rotten,"Rodriguez may have been going for a thrilling film that features creativity and excitement, but Hypnotic is everything but."
rotten,Hypnotic‘s compelling vibe is slowly-but-surely diminished by a hit-and-miss midsection...
fresh,"The film is thoroughly entertaining while it lasts, and mercifully forgettable."
rotten,"Sadly, the title is a case of false advertising. Affleck looks far more sleepy than hypnotized by this incredibly derivative script."
fresh,"Hypnotic is a speedy, twisty, riotously enjoyable thriller that seeks to bend your mind into impossible shapes while also delivering more than a few droll wisecracks."
rotten,Don’t let the Christopher Nolan-like advertising fool you: Hypnotic is a decidedly average movie where effective thrills are let down by a shoddy script. Only those truly under Affleck’s spell need apply.
rotten,"Which is another type of movie set, and maybe a better idea for a film. Ultimately as absurd but not nearly as beguiling as the Spy Kids movies, Hypnotic is a fizzle not for spoiling but for perhaps making it sound more interesting than it actually is."
rotten,"At times I was reminded of the 2015 thriller Solace, in which Anthony Hopkins helped the FBI by functioning as a sort of psychic satnav. Somehow, this is even sillier."
fresh,Fast-paced and thrilling...
fresh,
rotten,"As it is, even with the short running time, there are plenty of opportunities to notice the lack of spark between Affleck and Braga, the grating bombast of the soundtrack and the paltry special effects."
rotten,"It’s sloppily executed, without a hint of dramatic tension."
rotten,"The mood is gun-happy and conspiracy-minded, but the real killer is what feels like 80 percent of the running time being spent with Affleck and co-stars standing in rooms explaining the plot."
rotten,"'Hypnotic' it isn't, nor is it any good."
fresh,"This is an electric cocktail of Christopher Nolan mind-bending and Troublemaker Studios exploitation ridiculousness. You’ve had this concoction in better forms, but the ice cubes light up in this drink, and there is sugar on the rim."
rotten,"A surprisingly leaden dud from the normally kinetic Robert Rodriguez, this sci-fi movie pushes its stars through reams of colorless exposition and a few chintzy-looking FX scenes."
rotten,Certainly not the steroid-fueled Hitchcockian thriller Rodriguez was going for. You’ll forget this one before you hit the parking lot.
rotten,"The plethora of plot twists will keep some viewers chuckling, but the overwhelming amount of exposition takes away most of the magic. Affleck is fine, but there is way too much happening here."
rotten,"It neutralizes itself. It becomes ""why are we even setting up all these [storytelling] structures?"""
fresh,"A thoroughly entertaining, B-grade imitation of a mediocre Christopher Nolan knockoff."
rotten,"The muted, lo-fi production values make the film feel like a B-tier hack job, and the execution, uninspired dialogue and wooden acting don’t help."
fresh,"A mostly-OK mash-up of Inception, Memento and other mind-bending, high-concept thrillers of yesteryear."
fresh,"[A] chintzy lo-fi Christopher Nolan riff that doesn’t have nearly enough life to work. And yet, there are just enough charming elements to save it from outright dismissal."
fresh,"Rodriguez is an unapologetic student and practitioner of B-movies. Within that realm, Hypnotic is actually somewhat restrained, at times borderline classical."
rotten,"As a film fan, you have to respect the continued indie spirit with which Rodriguez works... but the script and performances in “Hypnotic” are too laughably absurd to take seriously."
rotten,"The script feels like it was written from the point of the reveal, only to have a stagnant first seventy minutes do Hypnotic no favors."
fresh,"Clandestine identities are peeled back, shredded and stripped. Scenes are craftily played out again and reconstructed, with their reality reshaped, and payoff dolled out in a trickery of a story. ""Hypnotic"" is a mind-twisting ride from start to finish."
rotten,A trashy action pic with lots of twists.
rotten,Each twist feels more like a smudging eraser to what transpires before the swerve than an enhancing accentuation to what was being built.
rotten,"Even with Affleck working to keep the audience engaged, Rodriguez’s story crumbles under its own weight."
fresh,"Hypnotic is a twisty science fiction thriller from the mind of indie action auteur, Robert Rodriguez. The Ben Affleck starrer is an entertaining throwback piece, the type of film that Bruce Willis or even Affleck himself might have toplined 20 years ago."
rotten,"To make such a film in a post-Marvel, post-streaming world is a legitimately interesting feat. The ultimate result is a decently-engaging watch with enough fast-paced plot twists to shock M. Night Shyamalan."
rotten,No amount of hypnotism can convince viewers with basic quality standards that Hypnotic is a good movie. Ben Affleck's robotic acting makes this dull and witless sci-fi mystery even worse.
rotten,"Director Robert Rodriguez throws in some desultory gunfights and car chases, apparently in the belief that having stuff happen on screen is the same thing as telling a story or developing a plot."
fresh,"Despite its well-made action scenes, the film doesn't have the frenetic energy that has previously set Rodríguez apart. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,This slick and formulaic crime thriller begins with a mildly intriguing premise before evolving into a rather conventional cat-and-mouse battle of wits and weaponry.
rotten,"Like Inception, but dumb."
fresh,"While it's not plausible, believable, or even able to fully follow its own logic strains, it does achieve a certain level of deranged camp. Put it this way: It's never dull, and if nothing else, ""Hypnotic"" is a hoot."
rotten,'Hypnotic' throws as much of its tricks at you and unfortunately fails to land the emotive DNA it hopes to make you level with.
fresh,"A doofy, though never boring sci-fi thriller."
fresh,"For the most part it's fast-paced and clever, capitalizing on Rodriguez's economical filmmaking style, which includes shooting and editing the film while enlisting family members in other key roles."
fresh,"The movie is, if nothing else, ruthlessly efficient enough in delivering its crowd-pleasing bits that truly starving suspense genre hounds, at least, won’t necessarily mind."
rotten,"A grumpy Ben Affleck can’t save this confused thriller that has as many twists as a trepanning drill, and is about as likely to leave you feeling lobotomised."
rotten,“Hypnotic” can’t shake its televisual impulses and feature motion picture limitations.
rotten,Dismal knockoff of Scanners and Inception.
rotten,Affleck trudges through the proceedings... barely lifting his eyes and delivering his lines in a gritted monotone.
fresh,"An uneven, at times mesmerizing and dazzling mind-bender of a psychological thriller that plays like a drive-in movie version of a Christopher Nolan film."
rotten,"Rodriguez’s latest is a slick yet sleepy thriller that feels utterly disconnected from any real creative vision — ironic, given how it’s been touted as a decades-spanning passion project."
fresh,"It’s initially odd seeing Affleck in as low-rent a project as this. Yet a likable, overqualified B-movie lead in the Dana Andrews mold, his company is the kind of thing that tips Hypnotic over into comfort viewing."
rotten,"Hypnotic’s relentless barrage of bait-and-switches renders it opaque, concealing not only the emotional journey of Ben Affleck’s grieving father protagonist, but the logistics of the winding plot."
rotten,"Hypnotic idles in tedium instead of moving at a brisk and engaging pace. Instead of standing distinctly in its genre, it feels like a knockoff."
rotten,"There are a few moments when Hypnotic seems to have found its groove, but they are just an illusion."
fresh,"Hypnotic is gloriously silly, but consistently entertaining as it plays fast and loose with its mystic premise and keeps us as an audience hooked with every wild turn over the course of its brisk 94 minutes."
rotten,"A cool premise on paper ends up being a disappointing, hollow misfire on screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Hypnotic borders on absurd, lands nearly all of its ridiculous twists and turns, and does it all with a lead actor who, even if nobody else did, understood the assignment. The sci-fi concept is actually really strong, even if...too corny."
rotten,The gimmicky plot outwits itself with twists that will make your eyes roll.
rotten,"It’s easy enough to follow, but annoying in that we know we’re wasting brainpower piecing this pointless jumble together."
rotten,"Rodriguez forgoes his usual playfulness and sense of rebellious fun in favor of a Christopher Nolan-like mind-bender, bogged down by an overly serious approach and convoluted storytelling."
fresh,"As the season gets stuffier with bigger budgets and runtimes, it will act as a cosy reminder of what a summer movie looked like 20 years ago, and what’s more hypnotic than that?"
rotten,The real power of hypnosis is Robert Rodriguez being able to get this nonsense made
rotten,"While the final act provides some thrills, getting there requires you to endure two acts desperately in need of a dose of adrenaline."
fresh,"Hypnotic has that run-and-gun energy, rough around the edges but not in a way that impinges on the fun."
rotten,"The reality is that, not unlike an Escher painting, the damn thing keeps tying itself into knots. This isn’t the mesmerizing neuro-noir you want it to be. It’s closer to Inception for Dummies."
fresh,"Give “Hypnotic” time. It gets better. Not great, but better as it goes along."
rotten,"Despite its overly familiar story, Hypnotic could have been an entertaining B-grade movie with an A-list star; instead, it’s a forgettable, flat experience that lost its fizz at the scripting stage."
fresh,"“Hypnotic” is rewarding in the sense that if you give the movie an inch, you could walk away satisfied at the end. Having absurd expectations in check is certainly a prerequisite. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
rotten,The film is a pointlessly complicated house of cards that crumbles due to its own hollowness.
rotten,"[T]he movie's simple, slightly clever premise gradually and finally collapses."
fresh,Hypnotic often feels like a greatest hits compilation of sci-fi brain-teasers. That's forgivable as the plot gets progressively better and more interesting.
rotten,"Strangely inert in many ways, occasionally showing signs of life when the movie locks into thriller mode, but these moments are sadly few and far between."
rotten,"A mind-numbing, uneven and clunky mess that's not bad or campy enough to be a guilty pleasure B-movie."
rotten,A new career low for Affleck and Rodriguez.
fresh,"Hypnotic isn’t just refreshingly straightforward for Rodriguez, but for Ben Affleck too."
rotten,Repeatedly pulling the rug out from under the audience is not the same as good plotting.
fresh,"Imagine Christopher Nolan’s Memento if it had been rewritten by an escaped lunatic: voila, that’s Hypnotic, an entirely uproarious 90 minutes at the cinema which asks nothing more of its audience than that they keep their incredulity suspended..."
rotten,"The film feels a little too late to the party when it comes to a concept taking you inside of the mind, however that ends up playing out. Were it a bit less muted in presentation, perhaps the film could have been a more stimulating cerebral exercise."
fresh,"A must see, heart-pounding, edge of your seat thriller that will keep viewers guessing the whole way through."
rotten,"Multiple story revelations try to outdo one another in an attempt to fool audiences into thinking this story is multifaceted. In reality, everything is predictable, especially by the time you get to the main plot revelation."
fresh,"Fast-paced and never boring, the corny first half is made up for by a slick conclusion."
fresh,"While the illusions on top of illusions that Hypnotic piles up don’t always fit together into a compelling whole, it all manages to arrive at an appropriately cathartic conclusion that tosses everything out the window just as it hits home."
rotten,"It’s watchable enough, but ultimately has the counterfeit feel of a filmmaker dabbling in a genre that’s not a natural fit and finding little joy in it."
rotten,Robert Rodriguez’s crime caper is exhaustingly over-plotted and surprisingly short on fun.
fresh,"Clocking in at a brisk and compact 94 minutes, the sleekly made and surprisingly inventive “Hypnotic” resembles an “Inception” inspired thriller with a dab of Alfred Hitchcock and a full helping of Robert Rodriguez. It makes for a tasty meal."
rotten,"It sure is entertaining though to watch a movie cling to the rails so much and never quite falling off into unwatchable territory, but also never being fully able to pull all of its parts together to fully work."
rotten,It's not a confusing film — especially since Rodriguez uses the third act to blatantly spell everything out — but it's so narratively murky that you may find yourself wishing someone would hypnotize you into thinking you're watching a better movie.
rotten,"A B-movie with a C+ premise and D-minus execution, the last of which largely falls at the feet of director Robert Rodriguez."
rotten,"If this all sounds like mumbo-jumbo, it is."
rotten,"To its credit, the movie is never boring and has a solid concept but it’s in desperate need of heavy tweaking to find some middle ground."
fresh,"This slick mix of special effects and practical ingenuity puts Affleck in a fun position, and the slightly grizzled star’s still got the clench-jawed charisma to pull it off."
fresh,"To this day, How the Grinch Stole Christmas stands as one of the most inspired and truly magical holiday texts."
rotten,With a little more polish and a lot more restraint this could have been a holiday treat. Instead it’s a repetitive and sometimes laborious exercise...
fresh,"Gaspar Noe by means of Lars von Trier with John Waters, David Lynch, Harmony Korine, Nicolas Winding Refn, Bobcat Goldthwait, Rob Zombie, Darren Aronofsky, Uwe Boll, the Farrellys and Tim Story serving as creative consultants."
rotten,It just doesn't work taking these short Seuss stories and turning them into a feature film. Very unpleasant to watchd
rotten,I truly believe that Dr. Seuss defies adaptation and is best left in print and in the imaginations of all who read the stories.
rotten,It's just an ugly piece of work.
rotten,"Director Ron Howard aims for the beautifully stylized mayhem of Frank Tashlin and Tim Burton, but he comes closer to the clamorous, headache-inducing visual overkill of Joel Schumacher's Batman movies."
fresh,"It's sweet enough for the very young, edgy enough for teens, and world/pop culture savvy enough for adults."
rotten,The film is an act of love that doesn't quite transmit all of the passion it wishes it could. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,A forgettable film in Ron Howard's repertoire. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"I just can't imagine the editor and director sitting down together, and THIS being the final product."
rotten,"They really didn't have solid direction, they were just doing too much. That's coming from me, someone who routinely does too much."
rotten,"Director Ron Howard usually lets his comedies gestate organically, but his Grinch is frantic from start to finish."
rotten,"A fundamentally soulless, mercenary attack on soulless, mercenary things, and this ends up being deeply tedious and tiresome to watch, on pretty much every possible level."
rotten,"The director, Ron Howard, is a grand old heartwarmer (Cocoon, etc.) but the heart of this picture is dead."
rotten,"Such a departure from the book, it's not even Dr. Seuss."
fresh,"Live-action version of classic has some crude, scary moments."
rotten,"An unforgivable transgression from the usually reliable Ron Howard, ""Grinch"" boasts the visual polish of a Menards tree aisle and resembles not a cheerful Christmas, but rather what the bloodcurdling onset of a mescaline bender might feel like."
rotten,"Howard and the rest of the crew do something the late Dr. Seuss never would: take chronological age over the youthful, innocent spirit that lingers untouched in everyone--and never goes out of style."
rotten,"Five-year-olds might go for it, but people who grew up with Jones' version will be looking at their watches and grinding their teeth."
rotten,"Cloying fancy gives way to gross-out comedy, twisted social commentary, affecting pathos, and weirdly sexualized romance in this lurid live-action version of the classic children's book."
fresh,Parents can relax: Ron Howard's version of Dr. Seuss' tale of the Christmas-napping Grinch is a smartly stylized hoot.
rotten,"Shrill, strenuous and entirely without charm."
rotten,"The costumes astound, the sight gags abound, but the heart, oh the heart, now that must be found."
rotten,"A jumbled mess, art-directed to within an inch of its life."
rotten,"Unfortunately, Ron Howard is the Grinch who stole Christmas from Jim Carrey, Dr. Seuss, and the children who deserve a better story."
rotten,
fresh,"A holiday gift, The Grinch just may steal the hearts of kids and grown-ups alike."
rotten,"Universal Pictures has definitely left something under your Christmas tree, but you might want to clean it up soon before it leaves a permanent stain."
rotten,"In adding material, The Grinch loses much of its rhythm and the heart within it shrinks three sizes right along with it."
rotten,How the Grinch Stole Christmas is thick with irony but doesn't have the guts to explore any of it.
fresh,"If God is in the details, then this is the most righteous movie ever made.Jim Carrey is the only man deserving to interpret Chuck Jones' animation."
fresh,"It's funny, it's sincere and it's gloriously bizarre."
fresh,This delightful fantasy offers Happy Who-lidays to the young and the young at heart.
fresh,"Carrey is superb, swamped in makeup and sounding like a cross between Hitchcock and The Honey Monster."
fresh,Howard and his writers have made some interesting choices in bringing one of the most well-known American Christmas cartoons to life on the big screen.
rotten,"The story’s message has always been that Christmas isn’t about baubles and trinkets or Santa and trees, it’s about celebration and joy. The problem is that the film collapses under the sheer weight of Carrey’s performance and the additional story elements"
fresh,"Colourful adaptation of the children's classic by Dr Seuss, redeemed by a combination of Jim Carrey's manic performance, the sets and the make-up."
rotten,You may feel like he stole 2 hours instead of Xmas and you'll want them back.
fresh,Director Ron Howard's movie version of the popular Dr. Seuss classic creates a world of wonder and enchantment for kids of all ages. I found myself captivated by everything about it.
rotten,"A shockingly noisy, ugly film."
rotten,"""We'll slow down the pace and add flashback scenes, ""To the time when the Grinch was less furry, less green. ""We'll beef up the part of little Cindy Lou Who, ""Throw in lots of slapstick and sentiment, too."
rotten,So the true meaning of Christmas and the simplicity of Dr. Seuss' classic holiday message were exploited by the crass commericialism of Universal Pictures. Did we really expect anything different?
rotten,By the time that you read this short essay of ours / The Grinch will have made ten squintillion more dollars!
fresh,How the Grinch stole Christmas is one kind of larceny. How Jim Carrey steals the picture is another matter entirely.
rotten,"Other than some pretty good set design and special effects, there was nothing new of value in this version."
rotten,
fresh,"Definitely worth adding to the Christmas movie pantheon, but not at the expense of the original."
rotten,Watching it approaches the disturbing position of being bedside as a loved one expires from a terminal disease.
fresh,
rotten,"We should probably be grateful that The Grinch is merely flawed and mediocre, not the flat-out disaster it could have been."
fresh,Truly crowd pleasin' and Carrey's the reason.
rotten,Perhaps 20 minutes too long and subject to torpor.
rotten,"Less entertaining, less enlightening and less educational than either the book or the video."
fresh,"This very funny, visually stunning film is a delight from start to finish."
fresh,Howard has certainly nailed the playfully eccentric other world of Whoville.
rotten,"For tales that require some edge, it is safe to deduce that Ron Howard is no match for the great Dr. Seuss."
rotten,"The movie feels like it is perpetually in conflict, torn between its desire to be both a light-hearted fable and a dark black comedy."
rotten,...severely (and unwittingly) alters the very source material beyond a point of explanation.
rotten,One of the ugliest movies ever perpetrated on a mass audience.
fresh,
rotten,"A movie with good set and costume design, and very little else."
rotten,Should be more heartfelt and touching than it is.
rotten,"Anthony Hopkins was chosen to narrate the film, perhaps to recall the English accent of Boris Karloff from the vastly superior original animation, a move the filmmakers should have avoided."
rotten,It is impossible to watch Grinch and not think wistfully of that magical moment in the TV special.
fresh,A wonderfully funny movie with all the best that Jim Carrey has to give.
fresh,"It's the rare holiday movie that manages to entertain the kid in all of us, without forgetting that grownups love the Grinch, too."
fresh,"Carrey, with another ground-breaking performance, single-handedly elevates it to something much better."
fresh,Generally delightful live-action adaptation of the children's classic.
rotten,Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot. But Director Ron Who-ward saw gold in a pot.
fresh,[It] could have certainly benefited from a little more of that mischievous nature.
fresh,"Shows respect for the words and images of the book, and the wonderful 1966 animated classic."
fresh,"If you have little moviegoers around for the holidays, you should still make the trip to Whovillie."
fresh,"It's Christmas, for Grinch's sake; better to overdo it than be sacrilegious and not."
fresh,Sure to earn a berth among the perennial Christmas film classics.
fresh,Any tale that critiques the over-the-top commercialism of our society is right on track.
rotten,"Grinchy-poo, you used to be a mean one... now you're just a goof. Sigh."
rotten,The movie seems content to operate without a soul.
rotten,What they forgot to budget for was heart.
fresh,This Grinch isn't so bad. It's quite merry. Very!
fresh,"Believe it or not, the Critic loved The Grinch!"
rotten,You won't need a heart two sizes too small to gnash your teeth at this Grinch.
rotten,The problems with Grinch stem from the lackluster script.
fresh,How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a holiday winner.
fresh,It is closer to wonderful than it is to awful.
fresh,Howard and company actually make the collision of Seuss' sing-song poetry and Carrey's smart-aleck asides and sniggering sense of humor work.
fresh,"Actually pretty entertaining, even for grown-ups, once you get through the first 10."
fresh,A cute and funny movie in its own right.
fresh,A true timeless classic this film may not be; It's simply a package of holiday glee.
rotten,It's not Christmas that's being stolen here. It's the spirit of Dr. Seuss.
rotten,You've got a stinker that deserves to be locked away in the yuletide bomb shelter along with Scrooged and Santa Claus: The Movie.
fresh,The main show here is Jim Carrey. And he does a frankly brilliant job.
fresh,The result is a vulnerable and sympathetic performance that may be Carrey's best to date.
fresh,Boasts comic punch.
fresh,Michael Corenblith's busy production design provides plenty to look at.
fresh,"At its center, it has Carrey, whose nasty, catty Grinch is a hoot and a half."
fresh,So that is how a Grinch and a girl steal this movie -- through heart and emotion. And aren't we glad they did.
rotten,"Se compone bastante y puede llegar a ser conmovedora, pero el inicio no le ayuda"
fresh,"In reviewing this movie it all comes down to one thing: When the credits rolled, I had a big smile on my face."
fresh,
fresh,Ron Howard seems much more engaged by the anarchy and mischief of the Grinch than he does with the pleasantries and communal feeling in Whoville. Perhaps there's hope for him yet.
fresh,Jim Carrey is superb as this classic renews itself and glee is had by all
rotten,Contributes to the same commodification of the holidays it tries so desperately to criticize.
fresh,"Children will adore it, teens will find it hip, and adults will flock back to see it."
fresh,Only a real Scrooge could fail to enoy this tasty little holiday morsel.
fresh,Nobody wants to leave Grinch feeling grouchy. And probably nobody will.

fresh,"A testament to the love and respect and diligence of director Ron Howard and his crew, screenwriters Jeffrey Price & Peter S. Seaman and committed, wonderful performances by the cast."
fresh,"It's got an impressive visual scheme, a terrific supporting cast and a surprisingly funny script."
fresh,
fresh,The film deserves to become a holiday perennial.
fresh,It boasts a central performance by Jim Carrey that's so physically manic and verbally clever that he's like a force of nature.
fresh,Audiences will feel like their own hearts are two sizes too large at the end of this wonderful sugarplum of a movie.
fresh,"Jim Carrey's resilient spirit, rubber bones, and love of charades, carries the production like an over-packed sack of toys up the steep slippery slope."
fresh,"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas means to amaze, beguile, delight. And it will."
fresh,"While Carrey and the audience would be better served by a less cluttered, hyperkinetic production, the star's animated intensity keeps The Grinch moving."
fresh,"With wonderful costumes and sets made of pure fantasy, The Grinch should leave most viewers feeling warm and fuzzy."
fresh,An instant classic that will keep people streaming into multiplexes this year and for many more to come.
rotten,A holiday treat on par with unwrapping a pretty box full of underwear and socks.
rotten,"Numbingly unhip, nonsensical and just plain dull story."
rotten,This true-life saga of capitalism run amok is neither as enlightening nor as infuriating as intended.
rotten,"Honestly, this plays like the movie all the actors made but decided to remove all references to it because they were so ashamed by the results."
rotten,"Yates leans too heavily on cutesy timing, flimsy seriousness, and cliche. There are no fingerprints of an artist to be found, just a chunk of content to be lost in the algorithm, which isn’t such a bad thing when the film is absolute piffle."
rotten,"The messaging is thorny, with a lighthearted, glib attitude that makes the film seem confused with its own intentions."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers is entertaining-enough, but there is a lack of focus that makes the story feel like one big missed opportunity. The buildup features great performances, but the finale is familiar and rushed. It lacks the style it strives for."
fresh,Emily Blunt can do no wrong. She is totally captivating in this timely film.
rotten,"Unfortunately, the filmmakers let Blunt down by never quite nailing the tone of bemused outrage the material demands. Evans cops it even worse with a poorly written role as Liza’s cynical boss."
rotten,"The morality tale that is Pain Hustlers shifts tones abruptly in its third act, where greedy and unethical characters get their comeuppance."
rotten,“Pain Hustlers” is overlong and at times frustratingly dull. But perhaps its biggest offense lies in its focus. The movie is so honed in on its disgustingly wealthy profiteers that the true victims (the people who actually died) barely have a voice.
fresh,"Yates elicits compelling, commanding work from his leads that effectively elevates the proceedings on a recurring basis..."
fresh,It's very entertaining but unfortunately somewhat morally bereft.
rotten,"Pain Hustlers aims high and means well, but Yates directs this annoyingly untidy film like it’s The Wolf of Wall Street."
rotten,Even the energetic performance by the Brit actress Emily Blunt can't save this misfire.
rotten,"Pain Hustlers tries really hard to build a hero, tear her down, and then rehabilitate her status, but to what end? The film ends up using the fentanyl crisis as a narrative drive, a highly dubious move when you're supposed to be spreading awareness."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers not only needs a higher dosage of fresh ideas, but a new prescription altogether."
fresh,"The tone swings hectically between drama and comedy, as though the film is in two minds about being  satire or drama. Still, the whole thing is nicely anchored by Blunt, who puts in a sterling performance with a very convincing heartland American accent."
rotten,"A somewhat superfluous film, that evades convention and fails to find relevance.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"In a bizarre narrative choice, it is the pharmaceutical rep with a heart of gold that gets to be the centre of a film about the opioid crisis, while the very real people who lost their life because of addiction seem like an afterthought."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers struggles, in multiple ways, to be effective and leaves us with the feeling that the makers weren’t on the right side of the slant they ran with. It was too frivolously handled and it wasn’t clear what message it intended to get across."
rotten,"There is some snappy editing here and a handful of lively directing choices that threaten to push the film into more inspired territory, but it’s not enough to overwhelm the workmanlike, by-the-numbers construction of the rest of the project."
rotten,It leaves you questioning the actual message the film intends to convey.
fresh,"Like so many movies of its kind, Pain Hustlers gets too wrapped up in the thrills of the grift to service its ultimate indictment of drug companies and their questionable practices."
rotten,"Shorter and sweeter explainers of pharmaceutical sales and marketing to doctors exist in droves. It may well be that Yates and his filmmaking team knew all this going in, and decided to sleepwalk their way through the process. It certainly feels that way."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers feels like a retreading of the same ground covered in other recent works, bringing nothing especially new to the table and, in splitting the stylistic difference between slick/breezy and poignant/authentic, succeeding fully at neither."
fresh,"It's plenty entertaining, but not particularly thoughtful — just enough depth to fill a prescription pad, not a whole book."
rotten,"Emily Blunt is one of our greatest actors, but Pain Hustlers feels overlong, dull and and ultimately misses its mark."
rotten,"A trope and unoriginal. It is not so much an homage but a knockoff of better films and series that have come before it. It’s all flash with false promises, little substance, and harmful for you."
fresh,"…by framing an upbeat, feel-good story against a real human catastrophe, Yates blunts his own message, and it’s fair to complain that the well-meaning but overtly fabricated Pain Hustlers somehow ends up letting the bad guys off the hook once again…"
fresh,"A mixed bag for me, but any excuse to watch Blunt pull off a character like Liza makes it mostly worth watching."
rotten,A movie that looks like it is about something important but lacking the insight to get there.
rotten,"“Pain Hustlers” has a buzz, here and there. But the story and these characters never really get their hooks in us as Yates leans on the sentimental, takes us to an indifferent climax, and then throws in a couple of anti-climaxes to boot."
rotten,"A movie about the people who enabled America’s opioid crisis shouldn’t have the look and feel of a Pitbull music video, but there you have it."
fresh,"Emily Blunt radiates with her magnetic and engaging performance as Liza Drake [and] pairs well with Chris Evans, who does a good job playing a fast-talking sales rep."
rotten,"Misses the mark on tone, style and pace. We've seen this story before, but better executed and with better results. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If Scorsese hadn’t done it first, then this style wouldn’t have come to the mind of Yates. It’s unfair to compare films and filmmakers, but when the style is so blatantly copied it feels unoriginal."
rotten,"It gives us little tossed-off jokes that go splat, moribund third-act sentimentalism, a slick veneer to gloss over its tonal deficiencies and a protagonist who needs more depth and crisper definition along the edges instead of rudimentary Screenplay 101."
rotten,"It's starts off strong, the first 40 minutes or so, but then it becomes trite and repetitive and you get bored with the whole story. It has fantastic actors, Emily Blunt and Andy Garcia, but they can only do so much with a lackluster script."
fresh,"Pain Hustlers is both watchable and eye-opening, even though its dramatic impulses do kind of cancel each other out."
rotten,"Netflix's Painkillers and their latest, Pain Hustlers, are vapid entries that don't have anything to add to the conversation."
rotten,"Essentially, 'Pain Hustlers' realization isn’t as eye-opening as it should be – considering there are other films and series that have told the same story."
rotten,"It aims to be a Wolf of Wall Street for the opioid crisis, but ultimately just ends up an entertaining, but empty, watch."
rotten,"While the top half of Pain Hustlers is illuminating, the story falters by trying to make the lead character sympathetic."
rotten,"Pain Husters manages to avoid feeling like an Adam McKay remake of Dopesick, but its shifting tone never quite hits the right notes."
rotten,What begins as a fresh film with a certain dynamism gradually becomes a discreet attempt to milk the most emotional side of everything related to the opioid crisis. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Pain Hustlers tries too hard to be compelling, failing to highlight the raw talents within its grasp and the detail that leaning into the emotional crux of the characters could’ve made it better."
rotten,I don’t really know what Pain Hustlers wants to do.
rotten,"Pain Hustlers is one of the most predictable, uninteresting, and boring movies of the year."
rotten,"Emily Blunt anchors Pain Hustlers often over-the-top antics with ample humanity, but the formulaic execution and uneven tone is a bitter pill."
rotten,"Emily Blunt is so emotionally present that she almost redeems the movie. She doesn’t, but she at least makes the first half of “Pain Hustlers” watchable."
rotten,"There is no guts to Pain Hustlers’ try-hard gonzo-ness, resulting in a sub-Scorsese style that both underlines and loses its point."
rotten,What it comes down to is several movies share the same type of storytelling and premise but are presented more engagingly and memorably than Pain Hustlers.
rotten,[T]he human toll of the crisis at its core seems like an afterthought to the filmmakers.
fresh,“Pain Hustlers” is Liza’s story to tell and Blunt finds a way to bring her to life and connect us with her.
rotten,"Yates is unwilling to create a grittier understanding of self-preservation and psychological detachment, giving the wholly reprehensible world of pharmaceutical profiteering the Disney treatment."
rotten,You’d have to be on drugs to enjoy it.
fresh,"The movie is constrained by its own conscience, thriving when Evans’s marvelously feral Pete is unleashed to dress like a Lonafen spray and rap about sales commissions, only to pivot apologetically from corporate bacchanals to suffering victims."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers is flashy and annoyingly bereft of any complexity. Yates and his collaborators are wading in the kiddie pool with brightly coloured floaties and even then, they’ve gone way beyond their depth."
fresh,David Yates‘ occasionally comedic crime drama is mostly fast paced and always fast talking
rotten,"It’s hard to extend much credit for the subject matter when it’s exploited for a “wild ride” that isn’t even wild, hawking a true story that isn’t even true."
rotten,The excitement that the film tries to generate for its main characters is disturbingly glib.
rotten,"In the end, the movie acts much like its characters: It diverts the viewer’s attention with gaudy visuals and melodramatic plot points instead of ever coming close to telling a single uncomfortable truth."
rotten,"It does want you to feel horrible about the loss of life while presenting it through the filter of a warped, irony-saturated Horatio Alger story, however, and that’s where the wild ride of it all gets too bumpy for its own good."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers fulfills the basic requirement of explaining the harrowing true story effectively, but given its star leads and skillful director at the helm, it could have and probably should have been much better."
fresh,"Pain Hustlers could have used more depth and originality than it has, but it still deserves credit for shining a light on a problem that’s only gotten worse since the time depicted in the film."
rotten,Flush this prescription down the toilet.
rotten,Some decent performances and an interesting topic can't prevent the overdose of clichés
rotten,Pain Hustlers is a well-acted and watchable but all too familiar drama. It's a picture of a picture.
rotten,Needing to follow a protagonist whose sympathies the film can leverage at any point blunts whatever judgment it wants to cast on its characters—and the broader history it’s trying to depict.
rotten,"The screenplay hopscotches all over and the film wastes a great slimy performance from Evans and a decent, if unremarkable, one from the normally terrific Blunt."
rotten,Pain Hustlers badly wants what The Wolf of Wall Street has but has no spine or bite to get there
fresh,"Boosted by the efforts of a top notch cast and some clever plotting, Pain Hustlers continually walks a fine line between good taste and bad, but thankfully it comes out mostly ahead in the end."
rotten,"It offers the bones of a compelling story, but one-note characters, riskless storytelling and creaky pacing prevent this film from making an impact. This is a prescription best left unfilled."
rotten,"... While Pain Hustlers achieves a few ruthless and powerful scenes, as a whole it ends up being quite unsuccessful and disappointing due to its superficiality and lack of subtlety. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,David Yates directs a story that entertains and provokes deep reflection on the human consequences of corporate greed. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,The film takes no creative risks while leaning into all the cliches. There’s just nothing new here.
rotten,A shallow true-crime comedy struggling to bust out of the staid drama it becomes.
rotten,"Pain Hustlers is a rehash of a rehash. It isn’t even leftovers, it is congealed, cheese-flavored goo someone dared called “macaroni and cheese”."
fresh,It’s predictable but glossily watchable.
fresh,"Blunt is on fire, co-star Chris Evans is serviceable, and Andy Garcia is a hoot as the imperious, eccentric, billionaire boss."
rotten,A well-acted and initially gripping story that loses momentum about halfway through and undergoes severe and often implausible shifts in tone.
rotten,"Pain Hustlers waits until very late in the game to really drive home the horrors behind the opioid epidemic. For too long we’re complicit with its characters. And maybe that’s what it’s going for; but if so, it leaves an unpleasant aftertaste."
fresh,"A real-life story with social issues about capitalism that is entertaining and funny while it makes you think, without being too earnest and serious."
rotten,"Blunt mostly rises above the mediocre material, and Chris Evans continues his post-MCU hot streak of lacklustre projects."
rotten,"Pain Hustlers is a waste of great actors and an interesting premise that's unfortunately been exhausted by other more worthwhile documentaries and fictional portrayals that have come before it. Chaotically-paced, predictable, dirty, and unfunny."
fresh,"Pain Hustlers manages to be lively and moving, while also illuminating exactly how broken the American health care system is and how all of us are caught in its claws."
rotten,"To Yates's credit, Pain Hustlers moves nicely, paced like Scorsese's relentless The Wolf of Wall Street, but nearly an hour shorter. It doesn't outstay its welcome, but neither does it challenge its audience."
fresh,"Formulaic Netflix fare. Blunt and Evans are both having a lot of fun. Yates has nothing of value new to say about the opioid crisis, it feels too long and lacks bite, but it's still highly entertaining because of its high energy."
fresh,Pain Hustlers is a fleeting funhouse of club jams and over-the-top blazers. It is a horrendously good time for a film meant to tackle big pharma's deadly neglect during the opioid epidemic.
rotten,"A dramatically conflicted film that lacks energy and momentum, Pain Hustlers is a rote fictionalization of a real investigation into America’s opioid crisis. The characters it concocts feel like the products of too many rewrites."
rotten,Pain Hustlers is attempting to create an actual dichotomy of heroes and villains in the world of scummy pharmaceutical reps without ever acknowledging the character’s willful blindness to the effects of pushing a highly potent narcotic on the public.
rotten,"[Yates'] filmic language never offers quite enough sex, quite enough excess, quite enough of capitalism’s depravity. “Pain Hustlers” just doesn’t know how to commit."
rotten,Pain Hustlers is a mixed bag of entertainment that opts for flashiness instead of focusing on the important elements of the story at hand.
rotten,"The overall production value may be showy, but the polish quickly fades to reveal a consistently dull experience."
rotten,Chris Evans & Emily Blunt try their damnedest but cannot shake off the feeling that they are merely cosplaying as evil execs.
rotten,“Pain Hustlers” entertains thanks to its strong leads but it’s hard not to find it a derivative look at a tough topic that relies on tropes from far superior movies.
rotten,"Blunt’s performance is the main selling point in a largely ineffectual satire. In the opioid-movie space, Pain Hustlers does more pharm than good."
fresh,"Emily Blunt delivers a fantastic performance as a woman who, despite her irresponsible actions, still makes us root for her to correct her actions, even if it’s too late."
rotten,"A slick but hollow movie that pales next to two recently, similarly themed limited series."
rotten,"And while Pain Hustlers is a perfectly fine title, the film probably should have been called Liza Drake, the name of the sales rep played by Emily Blunt, who single-handedly almost saves this tone-deaf drama from itself."
rotten,"At its best, the film is just a nice time spent watching Emily Blunt and Chris Evans being great on screen. At worst, this is a prescription for an uninspiring and even dull experience."
fresh,Yates keeps this thing humming along but doesn’t take his eye off the message: beware consumers because there is no such thing as an instant cure even if your doctor writes you the prescription for it.
rotten,Yates’ film is more focused on being easy to swallow than it is on meaningfully addressing the source of the pain.
rotten,"In a streaming landscape already saturated with takedowns of Big Pharma and its pill-popping perfidy, it’s a generic version of far more powerful originals."
rotten,"Attempting to be an ironically entertaining cautionary tale about the evils of capitalism and the monstrousness of drug companies, Pain Hustlers fails to seduce or repel. This supposedly bitter pill goes down too easily."
rotten,"Blunt remains committed to the end but even she can’t add a shine to the drab last act, the pleasure of seeing her on screen replaced with the pain of another undeserving project."
fresh,Bolstered by committed performances.
rotten,Does Yates really think his shrill satire has gotten audiences so riled up that “Pain Hustlers” will compel them to change the world?
rotten,"We’ve had plenty of films that have stated that greed, for lack of a better word, is good, and Pain Hustlers—with its sights set on the pharmaceutical companies behind the opioid crisis—doesn’t add anything new to that conversation."
fresh,"Bill Burr looks like he's doing stand-up during most of it. Bobby Cannavale is hilarious in a very broad, crazy, zany kind of way..."
fresh,"Bill Burr's stand-up comedy rocks, his acting is surprisingly good, and his directing debut is promising. Especially since ""Old Dads"" advocates for a demographic that doesn't get a lot of visibility these days."
fresh,"Very funny... serves up a sound backhander to the insipid nature of woke culture where offense is taken at every turn...Burr, who co-wrote with Ben Tishler, proves himself a fine director, giving each character arc, even the supporting ones, their due."
rotten,"Old Dads is funny for a bit but quickly overstays its welcome, resulting in a disjointed movie that never quite pulls itself together."
fresh,"The title ""Old Dads"" is misleading. If you're a new middle-aged parent, there's surprisingly little in the ""promise of the premise."" As written, it might as well be called ""Old Guys"" as it's mostly Gen X mocking Gen Z. Still, the ""Braveheart"" bit crushes."
rotten,A vulgar and unfunny comedy.
rotten,"Quality-wise, it lands squarely in the middle of the pack, which is probably just good enough for its intended audience. For the rest of us, it's another throwaway comedy with stale jokes and a watered-down premise."
rotten,"It amounts to comedian Bill Burr turning his stand-up act into a feature with a three-act structure and supporting characters. If you like Burr, you’ll be in familiar territory and perhaps be able to simply go along with what’s presented."
rotten,"At least try to be relevant, Mr. Burr, instead of telling jokes recycled from old episodes of According to Jim."
rotten,"What’s considered fun and acceptable may not be anyone, so where do I fit in? However, things feel included to have something to shake a fist at."
fresh,"The movie as a whole is just a clothesline to hang a string of grievances against an ultra-sensitive and hypocritical society, but like Bill Burr's stand-up material when it hits it can be very funny."
fresh,"The writing sometimes collapses into overkill, but sometimes it is precisely on point."
fresh,"Old Dads director/co-writer/star Burr understands the hypocrisy of some behavior among both millennials and Gen Xers, and there are a handful of very funny lines here."
rotten,"Here, his “woe-is-me” act loses steam quickly, as “Old Dads” wears out its welcome like the old man you pretend to listen to but couldn’t care less what he’s saying."
rotten,"Rather than challenge himself, Burr instead uses the film to adapt his schtick into a three-hander bro comedy addressing the generational divide regarding modern mores and language."
rotten,"Bill Burr's film isn’t the worst directorial debut by any means of the phrase, but the film's raunchy comedy fails to say something meaningful."
rotten,"A number of big laughs can be found in the picture, yet the refusal to stick with its central idea grows frustrating."
rotten,"The spectacle of watching a “bully” punch down at assorted cultural straw men, with his “boys” there to high five him after he does. That gets old fast, “Dad.”"
rotten,"A boorish and obnoxiously vulgar comedy that, since it can’t claim any other great distinction, might well have been expressly written to break the all-time record for use of the f-word in the major studio movie."
rotten,"As hot as he is on stage, Bill Burr picked a lousy time to try migrating his angry-guy act to movies, as he does in the fitfully funny Old Dads."
fresh,"It’s uneven in its pacing, a patchwork of scenes that just barely hold together thanks to the strength of Burr’s credibility as one of the world’s best working standups, which helps cover for his lack of polish as a filmmaker."
rotten,"The characters aren't really characters so much as they're stand-ins and targets for Burr's ideas and jokes, and those jokes are as stale as the Kaitlyn Jenner material Burr dusts off here."
rotten,"The whole ""does it offend you, yeah?"" routine only works if someone commits to it, and Burr is too much of a softy at heart to go all the way. He doesn’t want to piss people off, he just wants to air his grievances about progressive culture."
rotten,"A meandering, unfunny assault on PC culture that would seem perfectly in place in the 1990s alongside “Illiberal Education” by Dinesh D’Souza and the rantings of Pat Buchanan. It’s so dated there’s even a mention of Halliburton."
rotten,Old Dads has a frustrating narrative structure that doesn’t lend itself to what is actually funny here
rotten,"Rhetoric and drama are different beasts, and while Burr can construct strawmen and women on stage to knock down in an entertaining way, they become caricatures when embodied by actors on screen."
rotten,"Late-blooming comedian Bill Burr steps behind the camera for this Netflix comedy that's pretty standard and broad, but showcases his gift for generational beefs and snark."
rotten,"""Old Dads"" has a great cast, but it's barely a movie."
rotten,It is obvious that this is one of those funny films that can only make a section of people laugh. Are you among them?
rotten,A movie full of thoroughly unlikable characters... heavy in its criticism but sparse in its actual humor.
rotten,"When not being used to grind dull culture-war axes, sputtering impotent anger is a comedy staple. It just needs to be funnier than this."
rotten,"Given the unapologetic, sharp-edged tone of Burr’s comedy, it’s surprising that as director, co-writer and star of this vehicle, he played it so safe."
fresh,"If you find Burr’s stand-up routines funny, you’ll enjoy Old Dads, which also benefits from Cannavale’s hilariously beleaguered reactions, Woodbine’s solid underplaying and some very funny turns by a variety of comedians in small roles."
rotten,"Burr's directorial debut plays it too safe, clean, & far too tepid for a film that should have been Bad Moms with some serious verve."
fresh,"Burr is skilled at this, for sure. And Woodbine and Cannavale, who are better actors overall, slide into Burr’s mode with ease. The results will prove satisfactory and maybe cathartic for his fans."
rotten,"Old Dads is at its best when it highlights Jack's evolution and Burr's humor, and as for the rest of the movie, it's simply too much interference too often."
rotten,"It’s like an extension of Burr’s recent standup material, which is just as offensive as the stuff that Dave Chappelle has been putting out, but doesn’t attract as much outrage because not enough people are aware it exists."
rotten,"As a director, Burr displays discomfort in letting any meaningful moment breathe."
fresh,"Old Dads is the perfect streaming movie. On top of that, it is the perfect date night movie. With the well-balanced mix of comedy and drama, you can sit down and enjoy this with a loved one and have a good time."
rotten,"As a fan of Bill Burr, I think his directorial debut suffers from him having to share the spotlight. The beauty of his comedy is that he's saying the things we can't. It's not as fun when we have characters explaining why his comments aren't funny."
rotten,"Empathy for clowns isn’t happening, along with inspired ideas in “Old Dads,” which teeters on the edge of becoming “Old Man Yells at Cloud: The Movie.”"
rotten,"The attempts to be offensive fail, the emotional beats are never effective, and despite a handful of good laughs and amusing cameos, it's never that funny. Burr is a force to be reckoned with on the stage, but his directorial debut is the exact opposite."
rotten,There is humor in people not happy with anything past 1987 and the ever-changing times. But it also wears thin after incessant macho postering. Enough with anatomy jokes!
rotten,"And yet, for a film about a man engaging in precarious subterfuge among deep-jungle guerilla traffickers, it’s weirdly boring, its tension and intensity diluted by cornball overtures... and Caviezel’s long, slow, brooding stares."
rotten,"Monteverde's visual elegance is undermined by a script full of unnecessary clarifications, and underlinings. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It is a good, compelling story, but is it true? After a lot of fact-checking, I found out much of the story is not true, and the hero is significantly different in reality than the way he is depicted in the movie. The stink of QAnon pervades this movie."
fresh,Alejandro Monteverde directs a film with a solid narrative and elegant staging. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"""Sound of Freedom"" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that is both socially relevant and artistically impressive."
rotten,"As it turns out, Sound of Freedom is all bark, but it has no bite. Despite raising awareness on a difficult, but important subject matter, Sound of Freedom becomes a victim of its own lack of ambition."
rotten,"... if we're honest, the movie is particularly mediocre or perhaps even bad, or very bad, depending on your mood (and beliefs). [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If this flick wasn’t being used as a battleground in the Great Culture War this week, I’d forget I ever saw it within six months."
rotten,Sound of Freedom's over dramatic approach and conservative vibe when it comes to dealing with such a tough subject matter keep it from being taken as more than a flimsy based on true events search and rescue story.
rotten,"A deeply unappealing mixture of the sleazy and the self-righteous, the film isn’t exploitative in the generic shoot-’em-up manner of a Liam Neeson vigilante pic — it’s too pious for action."
fresh,It’s refreshingly unaffected. The storytelling is routine. It warrants neither its hard-core disciples nor its worst enemies. Ignore the dishonest huffing and puffing.
rotten,"By being so focused on the Message, they leave out any other aspect that might have served the film. The irony of all this is that if they had made a good movie, their precious Message would have been transmitted better. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"A thunderously crass and manipulative movie that is hampered by erratic pacing, pantomime bad guys and an overfondness for shots of Caviezel weeping God-fearing, manly tears."
fresh,Jim Caviezel is a one-man scourge of child predators in this well-meaning thriller that doesn’t entirely deserve to be written off as culture-war propaganda.
rotten,"It’s bizarre, unsettling and yet – in the filmmaking equivalent of turning wine to water – bracingly dull to boot."
rotten,Ballard is the infallible risen Christ who can never do wrong. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,The call-for-action message is definitively more important than the final result. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"If Sound of Freedom blows your mind, it may be down more to the disorientating lack of a dramatic arc than learning what the MSM apparently don’t want you to know."
fresh,Simply shut off all the noise about this film and go and see an entertaining film with a powerful message.
rotten,"Strictly cinematically speaking, Sound of Freedom is mediocre... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,This is just a dull and badly acted movie.
fresh,It’s worth a look because it’s a well-made example of a thriller inspired by unspeakable crimes that are being committed the world over.
rotten,There is too much going wrong on the creative front to hold your attention for two long hours.
rotten,"Though slickly made and never too openly lurid, at its core this is the simplest kind of exploitation movie, in which a stance of righteous indignation supplies an alibi for a fascination with hidden evil, linked in turn with a fear of corrupt foreigners."
fresh,The film-making is occasionally a bit clunky and obvious – but director Alejandro Monteverde (Bella) is clearly getting the most out of a modest budget.
fresh,"It’s almost disappointing that the bluster over it being an incendiary, faith-based film pushing a right-wing agenda and championing Qanon agit-prop turns out to be baseless. In actuality, the film unfurls as a fairly standard, well-directed thriller."
rotten,"Taking its reputation out of the equation, Sound of Freedom, when all is said and done, is a decidedly average, overtly melodramatic, emotionally manipulative drama"
fresh,"Despite all the attendant hype and noise, Sound Of Freedom is a solid second-tier thriller…nothing more, nothing less."
rotten,"The conflict and intrigue coursing through Sound of Freedom is not all that different from standard suspense-thriller fare, with overwrought asides in the film’s dialogue to remind viewers..."
fresh,"The movie’s a bit of a slow-burn, with most of the energy dedicated to physically locating where the traffickers, and the children they’re trafficking, actually are."
rotten,The bottom line is Sound of Freedom is no more compelling than an episode of a television series such as Criminal Minds. The acting is passable and the pacing laborious at times.
fresh,God's children are not for sale. Spread the word.
fresh,Say what you will about the movie. In the end it rises above the dubious claims and disingenuous concerns to offer a compelling and at times unflinching exposé that will stick with you for a long time.
fresh,An intense and soul wrenching thriller that explores one man’s calling to confront the evil scourge of child trafficking.
fresh,"Seeing the film, weeks after its release, the biggest surprise for me was that it is not remotely religious or political. There is nothing right wing about caring about trafficked kids."
fresh,There’s a good reason why this film has managed to carve out significant space in the summer box office marketplace – it’s effective.
rotten,"As a contribution to cinema, the movie comes up empty. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A movie that amounts to little more than an overlong episode of Criminal Minds, and one that serves as a stalking horse to some very unsavory stuff."
fresh,A competently crafted and acted dramatic thriller that effectively puts a spotlight on a tragic real-life issue. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"As for the losers, start with everyone who gave their money and two hours and 15 minutes of their life to a story that is at best embellished and, whether intentionally or by coincidence, profiting off conspiracy-fueled mass hysteria."
fresh,You won’t come away BLOWN AWAY by the film itself but your jaw will drop and I feel many people will walk away emotional from that. There’s a lot of heartbreaking stuff you learn. It is a solid watch.
rotten,The low-budget message indie has surprisingly become a box office hit for reasons I attribute to good marketing and not to being a good film.
fresh,"A gripping, if maddeningly slow-paced, fact-inspired story."
fresh,Sound of Freedom tells us about a reality we cannot ignore: trafficking in minors and child pornography exists worldwide. This feature film deserves all the attention just for daring to talk about such a critical issue [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Controversy and filmmaking flaws aside, Sound Of Freedom touches on an important subject that neither side should be politicizing."
fresh,"But beyond some stereotypes, the film works for its realistic seasoning. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A blandly competent thriller that finds an easy way into your feelings since it deals with child trafficking (a grave subject matter that has been tragically co-opted as a rallying cry for xenophobic, pro-Trump types)."
rotten,Reducing what could have been a potent piece to self-aggrandizing propaganda with its heart in the right place...
fresh,"But even as the film's pacing starts to thud... its work has been done, competently if not altogether artfully. Sometimes, obvious works just fine."
fresh,"Some aspects of this film are ethically dubious, and its credibility has been debated, but there’s no denying that “Sound of Freedom” is impactful and dramatically effective."
rotten,The movie has good intentions and the topic is heart-breaking but the film unfortunately can't keep up with the engaging 1st act. A great movie was in there somewhere but the script and sluggish pacing had me eager for the credits.
fresh,"A powerful, tense thriller which manages to tackle sensitive subject matter without getting exploitive.  There are some pacing issues and the film would have been better 20 minutes shorter, but it's also one of the most impactful films of the year."
fresh,It's an informative film that's a solid thriller in its own right.
rotten,The narrative diffuses into an improbable “Heart of Darkness” style river journey. Only kind of dull.
fresh,"Director Alejandro Monteverde beautifully weaves together a compelling story with captivating performances, led by Jim Caveizel. Think what you want about the man, but he perfectly slides into the role of Ballard, and delivers a passionate performance."
rotten,No more informative than a horror film about the boogeyman. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Not as political or religious as people are saying. It's a well-made thriller about an important topic. Nothing more but nothing less.
fresh,"Despite there being a message for everyone, it will have its detractors. But by the time the credits roll and the facts and figures of this terrible epidemic are given, it's hard not to feel something - and that is great use of art."
fresh,"Director Alejandro Monteverde establishes well-drawn good vs. evil battlelines and keeps it simple with basic storytelling elements during the 2-hour, 10-minute runtime, framing it as a wider-scope procedural, like an extended “Magnum P.I.” or “FBI.”"
rotten,"While the cinematography and acting are all solid, the way the trafficked children are depicted is made to exploit our emotions, and the end credits explain why: To continue the Operation Underground Railroad (O.U.R.) mission."
fresh,"With a faith-based undertone, this is a powerful, disturbing thriller, inspired by true events."
fresh,"Sound of Freedom is a heartbreaking yet beautiful film that shines a light on the horrors of human-trafficking. This is a necessary story, and while the dialogue doesn’t always land, the message is important."
rotten,"To know thousands of adults will absorb Sound of Freedom, this vigilante fever dream, and come away thinking themselves better informed on a hidden civilizational crisis… well, it’s profoundly depressing. Worse still, they’ll want to spread the word."
rotten,"A solemn, drawn-out bore."
rotten,"The villainous characters are caritactures, but I didn’t buy virtually any of the performances. And the”Sound of Freedom’s” funereal pacing and struggling manipulations left me cold, when I was expecting big emotional moments that never came."
fresh,Strikes the difficult balance between being entertained while telling an important true story on a subject that should be shouted from the rooftops. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,The polish only makes Sound of Freedom’s attempt to illustrate how a voguish cultural anxiety can be ameliorated if people would just be courageous enough to pursue it (or give money to those willing to pursue it) more insidious.
fresh,"It’s heartfelt, informative, and inspiring."
fresh,"Some of the dialogue is corny, and some of the acting is clunky, but the movie's intentions are in the right places. Sound of Freedom goes all-in with the tearjerking aspects of this drama about child sex-trafficking."
rotten,"Loudly bangs the drum for its important message, worshipping its protagonist without any thoughtful characterization, doing little of note beyond moving performances from Lucás Ávila and Cristal Aparicio as traumatized, tightly-bonded siblings"
fresh,"In a conventional pulp way, we’ve glimpsed the heart of darkness. We’ve seen something about our world that makes the desire to “take action” seem more than an action-movie gesture."
fresh,Sound of Freedom will inspire you to take action and do some good yourself
fresh,"[C]o-writer/director Alejandro Monteverde's thriller works at doing exactly what it sets out to do. It is disturbing, yes, but also a hopeful call for something to be done..."
fresh,Powerful performances highlight this stunning exposé on child trafficking.
fresh,Sound of Freedom plays like an action thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat at the same time as being a drama about Tim's first foray into rescuing trafficked kids. Caviezel's acting is spot on.
fresh,An intense look at the scourge of child sex trafficking. Holds your interest but difficult to watch.
fresh,"Sound of Freedom is a wake-up call, reminding Americans of the evil that’s perpetrated both inside and outside our borders."
fresh,Sound of Freedom has an effective mix of anger and compassion. It really makes you think about the problem of child sex trafficking and how we can all work together to end it.
fresh,"A triumph! Exhilarating! A powerful, heartfelt and gripping thriller."
rotten,"It’s certainly a noble idea and a valuable reminder of humanity’s capacity for extraordinary malevolence. However, there’s a much better film to be made about this sensitive subject matter."
fresh,Sound of Freedom is a suspenseful portrayal of the realities of human trafficking.
fresh,"Beautifully shot and expertly crafted, there's plenty of excitement and tension, though the effort to get across a story and a message gives it an edge of docudrama."
rotten,Here's a film that is offensive only in how inoffensive it proves to be.
rotten,Feels like an elegantly made - the cinematography and score are top notch - night time soap opera.
rotten,"At least, the film goes out of the way to show the use of condoms."
rotten,"If this is love, no thanks."
rotten,"In terms of story and character, this film is in desperate need of a safe word."
fresh,"Overlong, too clinical in design, and based on lowest common denominator entertainment (or so I'm told), Fifty Shades of Grey still manages to be engaging, funny, and unexpectedly human."
fresh,"Given that this is her second film, [Sam] Taylor-Johnson directs the film with taste and care by focusing on the interactions between Ana and Christian rather than the sexual side of the story and the film looks stunning."
rotten,"Fifty Shades of Grey will draw you in out of curiosity and possibly hopes of a good movie, then leave you wondering why you agreed to such a thing in the first place, much like the main character."
rotten,Funny that no one seemed to understand in the making of Grey that watching two vaguely defined characters engage in ceaseless rounds of conservatively filmed grimaces and stifled moans gets tiresome quickly.
rotten,"There is little more critical than to say a third of the film had people laughing at dialogue, and the other two thirds wiggling in their seats, not from discomfort or innervation, but from boredom."
rotten,You've seen worse; you've imagined better.
rotten,"Nice as it looks, this movie tastes bad..."
rotten,"Most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night HBO, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the erotic-charged hype surrounding the film."
rotten,You would've put the book down after reading the character's name on the third page: Anastasia Steele? Puh-lease!
rotten,[General audiences] might need to be handcuffed to their seats and wonder how something so wildly popular could be so stiflingly unerotic.
rotten,Every fiber of my being is screaming at her to send this man packing.
rotten,"The dialogue is terrible and Dornan's Grey is so humourless that any vaguely funny lines fall utterly flat. On the plus side Johnson does her best with what she's been given, Ana is a Thomas Hardy fan, and Grey has a nice kitchen."
rotten,"The entire palate of the film was cool and gray, which doesn't do much to incite passion. and I don't think we should blame the actors."
rotten,Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover (s)he's a cold fish between the sheets.
fresh,"This is worth going to the cinema for, leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film."
rotten,"Sometimes a book should just remain a book and in the case of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" that is exactly the case."
rotten,[Fifty Shades of Grey] simply never gets anything right.
rotten,"Among the many mind-bogglingly implausible fantasies Fifty Shades of Grey sells, the one I think that most accounts for its popularity is the promise that shame of sexual sin can be alleviated by surrendering to it more fully."
rotten,"I'm really worried about the fact that some people (especially girls) regard Mr. Grey as an object of desire, as some sort of ideal man. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The second half of the film devolves into something that resembles tedious, melodramatic daytime TV."
rotten,"Grey is not a character, but a cluster of clichés... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's superficial, it's manipulative, it's off-putting and embarrassing. But there's no denying that this says something about the moment in which the book was published and the movie released."
rotten,"The script is abysmally bad, filled with Shakespearean dialogue such as ""I won't touch you until I have your written consent"", and ""I don't make love, I f***... HARD"""
rotten,"Dakota Johnson shines in this clunky, boring and domesticated sex ruse. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"There is an awful lot of rose-tinted nostalgia here for a time when women sat passively while powerful men threw wealth at them, but the interesting difference here is that the power dynamic between Red Riding Hood and the Wolf shifts."
fresh,"Shortage of exotic shenanigans apart, artist-turned-director Sam Taylor-Johnson has delivered a decently acted and technically well-made adaptation of what remains a fundamentally silly and, at times, simply rather unpleasant story."
fresh,"I've seen way worse movies aimed at men and boys, so I think everyone can chill out about a mediocre movie aimed at women."
fresh,"It may not be your conventional Valentine's Day date movie, but it looks set to give audiences more pleasure than pain."
rotten,The retention of the style of the book and its settings merges with a cinematic story more focused on buildup than execution.
fresh,"The film's a hell of a ride, often a fun and thought-provoking one, even though it's all such camp."
rotten,"In the run-up to [Fifty Shades of Grey]'s opening, I was surprised at the promotional efforts of NBC's ""Today"" show in the daily banter of the hosts and beyond."
rotten,"Fifty Shades of Grey is so much smarter than its source material, but smarter in this case doesn't mean better. Not where it counts, at least."
rotten,"Alas, I was a reluctant Dominant because the movie itself is such a mousey, uninvolving little thing that somebody had to step up."
rotten,The most anticipated release of the year is not much more than a spanking great bore.
fresh,"Then the lights went down, and guess what? Fifty Shades of Grey turned out to be not just entertaining-at least until the clunky, exasperating final minute-but it also knows exactly what it's doing."
rotten,Not as dirty as we were led to believe by the ads.
rotten,Girls memorize the lines! But it's not a 'Rocky Horror' type cultural event; it's a lukewarm soft-core-porn soap opera-basically 'Pretty Woman' with spanking.
rotten,I wish it had either been much better or much worse.
rotten,"In the lacking of an engaging subjectivity, the narrative of sexual awakening falls flat."
rotten,"While the film is arguably no better or worse than its literary source, it does shatter the fantasies of sexual desire and sexual pleasure constructed within the novel."
rotten,"A guilty, if not particularly memorable, pleasure."
fresh,"Funny (often intentionally!), ferociously unsexy, and roundly entertaining from beginning to end."
rotten,"It's a warped, disturbingly abusive adult fairy tale from start to finish."
rotten,"Certainly there is an audience out there for this kind of story, and with any luck neither you nor I will ever have to interact with it."
rotten,This is a wannabe tragedy (with whips) about the knightly failure to commit to the maiden's romantic narrative.
fresh,"Fifty Shades of Grey delivers, however ponderously, on its promise of pop transgressiveness."
rotten,"Ultimately, Fifty Shades of Grey spends two hours describing a relationship that is bound to fail and doesn't even seem all that fun while it's occurring."
fresh,"Fortunately the two leads have real chemistry. Dornan makes Christian less creepy and more angsty than on the page and Johnson brings a surprising depth to Anastasia. They also know how to play certain scenes for laughs, making the film come alive."
fresh,"Let's talk about Dakota Johnson... she's the perfect blend of innocence and confidence; a stealthy heart-breaker who at first comes across as mousey and innocent, but suddenly and convincingly becomes confident and coquettish."
rotten,I was more aroused by the immaculate shine on Christian's piano than anything in his boudoir of bondage: a set designer must have spent hours buffing those ivories.
rotten,"Rather than anything to do with sexual connoisseurship or philosophy in the bedroom, all that comes across through Fifty Shades of Grey's absence of erotic heat is a lust for the appurtenances of luxury, something that's more commonplace than singular."
rotten,"It's cheap, misogynist, Z grade exploitation masquerading as the romance of a woman trying to tame the ultimate man, who by all accounts should be alone left to his own demented fantasies"
fresh,"It's not overstating the case to say that Dakota Johnson achieves stardom with this role. She mines moments of humor that help offset the soul-searching and weeping, and she's appealing without being impossibly beautiful."
rotten,"This movie is a mess. It's glacially slow, boasts a laughably clichéd soundtrack -- Beast Of Burden, anyone? -- and is plainly a cash-grabbing set-up to promote a full trilogy."
rotten,"Yes, there's tons of nudity, but erotic? No."
fresh,This alien quality is what makes Dornan so effective as Christian.
rotten,"Fifty Shades of Grey is one of the landmark works of the new millenium, the novel that proved definitively Americans will suffer through anything for a few fleeting moments of titillation."
rotten,"One day, it may become a bad movie/cult classic -- the kind of film that people go to laugh at, like Showgirls. But for now, it's so boring it feels endless."
rotten,The film is about the best adaptation that could have been drawn from this rather dull source material -- at least until it slows to a crawl on the deathly serious and dull home stretch.
fresh,Unexpectedly delightful.
rotten,"It was less terrible than I feared, but still fell well short of being good."
rotten,"When Christian sweeps the demure Anastasia off her feet and into his world of penthouse-and-helicopter luxury and sadomasochistic sex, what lies in store is two hours-plus of glossy tedium."
rotten,"There's a really funny, sexy comedy here that might have been wonderful, were it not also stuck with being an adaptation of this loathsome novel."
rotten,"Both actors are trapped by the rigid banality of their characters, and they fail to manufacture any chemistry -- without that heat, this is just a story about a contract negotiation."
rotten,"When you take a close look at Fifty Shades of Grey, it becomes painfully clear that it's basically a plethora of sex scenes strung together with a bare minimum of support."
rotten,It's pretend bondage. Caffeine-free Diet BDSM.
rotten,"It's rare when a movie is better than a book, but in this case, only because this movie is better than its source material doesn't mean it's good."
rotten,"If they added foreboding opening and closing monologues by David Duchovny, the whole thing could easily be mistaken for a long-lost episode of Red Shoe Diaries."
rotten,"Johnson brings some wonder and vulnerability to her part, but even with a listenable soundtrack, the song that most comes to mind is Peggy Lee's ""Is That All There Is?"""
fresh,"Grey may be crass and calculated, but Johnson saves it from being completely forgettable."
fresh,"Without the baggage of having read the book, the synopsis or even the film's Wikipedia page, Fifty Shades of Grey unspools as a surprisingly engaging story about sexual naivety, concepts of consent and, ultimately, power."
fresh,"Actress Dakota Johnson brings humor, sensitivity and vulnerability to Anastasia, making her the clear breakout performance of Fifty Shades [of Grey]."
rotten,A monumentally boring motion picture.
rotten,"Who would have thought, a Twilight ripoff actually being inferior to its already inferior inspiration."
fresh,"... isn't nearly as terrible as E.L. James' novel would make you expect. There's perverted, like the sado-masochistic sex games played by tycoon Christian Grey, and then there's perverse, like the pleasure of watching trash so glossily compacted."
rotten,"Basically, they made a lousy, mid-2000s-era Katherine Heigl romance with a handful of explicit sex scenes spliced throughout the familiar clichés."
rotten,A syrupy softcore melodrama with perhaps too much dialogue.
rotten,My biggest grip with the film was that I didn't find the two leading characters all that interesting.
rotten,"He's a wealthy tycoon named Gray who takes a woman to her limits. I'm talking, of course, about '9 1/2 Weeks.'"
rotten,Perhaps it's time for all of us to recognize that fantasies come in a great many more than 50 shades - and that they're not real.
rotten,"One suspects that Taylor-Johnson was never free even to push at the edges of sexual representation, and the film's lack of explicit imagery and grit is one of its disappointments."
fresh,What emerges in Fifty Shades of Grey is perhaps the best finished product that could rise from the depths of a compromised starting point.
fresh,Taylor-Johnson has made a film that is both sexy and stylish.
rotten,"I fault no one for whatever it is that gets their crank turning, but if this movie is working you need to take that thing out for a spin far more often."
rotten,"It's a bondage movie without much perversion, a love story without much passion, and ultimately, a film burdened with expectations it could never fulfill. It never quite hits as hard as you want it to."
rotten,I can only say that boredom set in early.
rotten,"While there's some meat to Dakota Johnson's role of the ingenue, Jamie Dornan is given absolutely nothing to work with for most of the film."
rotten,"In the end, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't so much terrible as it is timid and tame."
rotten,"The much-hyped film adaptation, in which James was closely involved, sticks closely to the novel, but is both strengthened and weakened by what director Sam Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel decided to omit."
rotten,"What is this thing called love? That's a question asked by Cole Porter. In 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' the initially virginal heroine has a very different if not entirely unrelated query: 'What are butt plugs?'"
rotten,Oh...my...god.
rotten,"Sam Taylor-Johnson's movie adaptation gets so caught up in the intrigue and melodrama that it never really finds its groove. Even the film's raw sex appeal is lacking, which just leaves a poorly plotted story and laughable dialogue."
rotten,...a lukewarm exercise in timidity that - if not exactly embarrassed by its subject matter - is extremely wary of diving too deeply into it.
fresh,"""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" which gingerly crosses over into the questionable subject mark, may not be the film some of the book's readers were hoping to witness."
rotten,There is a very good chance that I will see nothing worse all year. I'm pretty sure I will see nothing more brain-witheringly stupid and boring -- or less sexy.
rotten,The movie is simply a profitable pop culture movement with the only good thing coming out of it is Beyoncé's remix of 'Crazy in Love.'
rotten,"If this fanchise plans on being the ""Saw"" of Valentine's Day, I hope the next installment doesn't torture the audience so much."
rotten,This is a film that should have gone direct to Cinemax.
rotten,"Fifty Shades the movie seems destined to inspire more eye-rolling than lip-biting, even if there's no denying that its protagonist is better served by the film than the book."
rotten,"Think of it as the ""Downton Abbey"" of bondage, designed neither to menace nor to offend but purely to cosset the fatigued imagination."
rotten,"A wimpy, wounded billionaire sadist - correction ""dominant"" - with a cleanliness fetish and no friends stalks with gifts a passive-aggressive virgin."
fresh,It realizes this story is ridiculous in ways the book itself never could. It has an actual sense of humor.
rotten,"It's supposed to be a romance, but plays like a long, boring business meeting in which the naughtiest bits are raised not in the bedroom, but the boardroom, where contract negotiation stagger on over the proposed merger of his manacles to her wrists."
rotten,This adaptation of EL James's BDSM potboiler struggles to make a spanking cinematic silk purse out of its notoriously tin-eared source.
rotten,"A charm-free hero with control issues and a passive, fretful heroine have coy and tediously vanilla pretend-sex. This is meant to be erotic?"
rotten,"Panders to Twilight's housewives and teens demo using that story's template, but with sex! Kinky sex! The sex is incredibly boring and the alleged ""romance"" between a naïve college student and her stalkerish zillionaire suitor is deeply troubling"
fresh,"As silly and, yes, sanctimonious as this adaptation is, it deserves mention as one of the first major studio releases in ages to promote sex over vigilante violence or superherodom ... And that, in a peculiar way, makes the film a refreshing departure."
rotten,"A desultory dud, that swaps out [the novel's] prolonged and explicit intercourse for tame (conceived as tasteful) inserts, padded out by the troubled relationship between a straw man and blow up virgin."
rotten,"Beneath its curious surface, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is an uninformed and unrealistic ""romance"" set in the BDSM world that dangerously dramatizes sexual violence and glamorizes domestic abuse."
rotten,"I expect most viewers would rather see the filmmakers take this franchise in a different direction. How about Fifty Shades of The Grey, with the two vapid protagonists forced to contend with Liam Neeson and a pack of ravenous wolves?"
rotten,Such silliness.
rotten,A monochromatic misfire featuring only one shade: blushing pink.
rotten,"Frankly, after watching the film, I felt ambivalent. The film's not exhausting, at least. It's not quite fifty shades of dreck."
fresh,"Perfectly capturing the tone of E.L. James' sensational best-selling novel, this tale of control, sex and submission is tantalizing, titillating and provocative"
rotten,"Part of the appeal of the tawdry romance novel is that the visuals are left to the imagination for its legions of fans, whose expectations for steam and sizzle will inevitably be left unfulfilled here."
rotten,Profound is definitely not a word that can be associated with A Walk in the Woods.
fresh,Won't ever be mentioned in the same breath as any of Redford or Nolte's classic films - it's too silly and too obvious - but watching these two charismatic actors onscreen it's not hard to remember what we liked about them in the first place.
fresh,"(Redford and Nolte) make tired clichés feel like old friends, taking us on a pleasant stroll through the woods that may not lead anywhere, but we're having such a good time that the destination no longer matters."
fresh,"As an adaptation of Bill Bryson's writing A Walk in the Woods is disappointing, but there's still pleasure to be had in seeing two veteran actors taking a hike together."
fresh,"As beautiful, witty and serene as this story of self-discovery is, and as effortlessly as the veteran stars pull it off, I can't help but hope that Redford will take on a project with a bit more meat on the bone."
rotten,"Redford, Nolte, and co. want us to leave with a profound sense of self and inspiration, they leave us instead with a fairly fun buddy-comedy in the woods. Still, it's worth the walk."
rotten,American Pie for nursing homes.
rotten,"They wander across the screen, and we gain no insight into their characters. The dialogue isn't funny or moving. Nothing is ventured, and nothing is gained."
fresh,"Worth sticking with for that, and to see Redford and Nolte spark off each other like the old pros they are."
fresh,"""A Walk in the Woods"" makes you laugh and inspires you to reconnect with people and nature. It's truly a feel-good film."
fresh,"Tents collapse, bunkbeds give way and streams are there only for men-old-enough-to-know-better to fall into. Subtle it is not."
rotten,It's enough to make those Grumpy Old Men movies seem like masterworks of grace and subtlety.
rotten,"[Walk in the Woods] is like watching your grandpa explore America, but when he starts to lecture, you realize it's time to leave the old man behind for the bears."
fresh,"A Walk in the Woods isn't a spectacular film. It's just a good, simple, solid one. Pleasurable in the most unassuming way."
fresh,"[It's] more about the ebbs and flows of friendship than it is about the walk. And when the friends in question are a brace of ageing Hollywood heavyweights brimming with charisma, its no hardship to share time in their company."
fresh,"If you're in the mood for guys who resemble old furniture or aged whisky, bickering incessantly as they trek through miles of forest, A Walk in the Woods is just the thing."
fresh,"Darned if the film didn't ultimately work for me. Mostly, it was the fun of seeing these two veteran actors riff off each other."
rotten,"Inoffensive, unremarkable and mostly just a bit naff, this adaptation of Bill Bryson's memoir of walking the Appalachian Trail is about as good as it could possibly have hoped to be, which is to say not very good at all."
rotten,"A sitcom about old men creaking along the Appalachian Trail, reminiscing about slutty girls, and maybe having a stroke at any moment. You know, for fun."
fresh,"A Walk in the Woods is a big-hearted, endlessly funny and just plain likable survivalist-buddy-road-trip-comedy-drama that also has something to say."
rotten,"Bear jokes, poop jokes, bear poop jokes -- this movie's got 'em all!"
rotten,"Here, Bryson's a wizened cipher, wrapped in a grizzled grump, inside a pickled jerk. Patter gets pat, wise old-guy talk vies with lame wisecracks, and slapstick turns slapschtick. This slog's a waste of time and space."
fresh,"The film contains many incidents, constant drops of humor and some tear-jerker. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The premise of bickering old friends forced together while out of their comfort zones has been done before and far better (Whitnail and I, City Slickers), but the two leads' star power and easy charm makes this an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours."
fresh,A fun and simple comedy that works due to Robert Redford's and Nick Nolte's charisma. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"An enjoyable comedy for mature audiences, with some really hillarious moments. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,A little more pace and purpose might have prevented this being so pedestrian
fresh,"Man, I'm such a sucker for movies about grumpy old men taking trips."
rotten,"Unfortunately, its shenanigans end up being tiresome instead of charming. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,Most of the jokes revolve around the age of the characters and an over dependence on slapstick humor make this a rocky and slippery hike of a movie. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Redford and Notle are a great comedic couple because of their respective on screen personas. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Echoing his witty writing style, Bill Bryson's memoir of his trek up the Appalachian Trail is adapted as a gently amusing comedy that combines big landscapes with sharp observational humour."
rotten,"While you might find yourself musing how much more interesting it might have been to watch Emma Thompson walking in the woods for a couple of hours, you might also be distracted by the film's presentation of the Appalachian Trail per se."
rotten,"It hits its stride now and then, and mostly because of Nick Nolte."
fresh,"In the lightest movie ever made by either one, Nolte and Redford barely pull this one out of Lake Woebegone territory."
fresh,"Nolte finds real sympathy for Katz and delivers a compellingly watchable performance, even if you're slightly afraid he'll keel over at any moment."
fresh,"It's not heavy; it's not wildly significant. But A Walk in the Woods has a redemptive tone, a gentle lesson about aging and limitations and never giving up despite any required climb, uphill or otherwise."
rotten,"Robert Redford and Nick Nolte are fine actors, yet even they cannot save this one note story of a long journey to nowhere."
rotten,"Plunders laugh-out-loud scenes from the book - getting kitted out with ludicrously expensive gear, becoming obsessed with bear attacks - and turns them into deadening Grumpy Old Men/Victor Meldrew-ish moments of bewildered outrage."
rotten,"An uninspired mixture of slapstick comedy and sentimentality, A Walk In The Woods gets by on the charisma of the two stars but there are times when it feels stretched to breaking point."
fresh,Misadventure and musing about the meaning of life and growing old ensues.
rotten,"There are a few chuckles along the way, but only the scenery has any real depth."
rotten,Upping the age of the characters has turned a bad idea into a terrible one.
rotten,Unrelentingly inept.
fresh,A Walk in the Woods is unabashedly sentimental and sometimes as slow-moving as its two curmudgeonly leads but it has an undeniable and redemptive charm.
rotten,This is a schlep.
fresh,"Like the book upon which it's based, Robert Redford's latest is a film of small but continual pleasures - an amiable amble that's almost impossible to dislike."
rotten,"Nolte is terrific insofar as he is allowed to be, but what ensues is, cinematically, a mess."
fresh,"Chugging along like Planes, Trains And Automobiles with a drop in comic horsepower, it's an unremarkable but perfectly serviceable odd-couple caper that'll pass the time when it's a bit grim outside."
fresh,"Despite plodding interchanges and lack of cinematic bravura for some of America's most spectacular scenery, Redford and Nolte are genuinely hilarious together."
rotten,Run for the hills.
fresh,"This slight, lightly charming comic adventure is most obviously appealing for the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" set -- though Bryson himself was in his forties when he made his journey."
rotten,Redford's performance is really so stilted it's as if he is playing Bill Bryson the way a famous writer with no performing skills might play himself.
rotten,Kwapis's film is so un-Brysonishly leaden-footed that Redford and Nolte might as well have walked the trail in diving boots.
rotten,A Walk in the Woods is as aimless as its title.
fresh,"Redford takes on the role of Bryson, while Nick Nolte is his travel companion Katz, and the two veterans share an engaging chemistry that quite often makes up for the film's many shortcomings."
fresh,A pleasant-enough account of two shambling old geezers taking on the grandeur of nature.
rotten,A Walk in the Woods is a trifle compared to 2014's Wild... But darned if Redford's easy charm and Nolte's gravelly lack of it aren't enticing throughout. Even when drastically lowering their standards they're stars.
rotten,"[W]ith a richer comic vision of two weathered American males testing themselves against the primordial forest, the movie...might have made it to the finish line."
rotten,"There's very little about hiking in this movie, but you do get to see Nick Nolte stuffing pancakes into his stupid face."
rotten,"t's not so much that the movie is actively bad -- well, the largely dismissive attitude toward women is pretty bad -- as that it's almost aggressively mediocre."
rotten,Crudely written in a pedestrian way.
rotten,"Redford and Nolte make for a Pleasant ""Walk."""
fresh,"Instead of sharp comedy and insight into these men, we get broader situational and physical comedy skits. Despite that, enough of the comedy works. Redford and Nolte work so well together that it is worth joining these two guys on this trip."
rotten,"A moldy, unairable, two-hour sitcom pilot that I would downgrade cable plans to avoid."
fresh,"While this long-in-development comedic/dramatic charmer as directed by Ken Kwapis has a few tricky issues in the altered and updated details, there's also no doubt that it's most enjoyable, and definitely more fun than a dose of poison ivy."
rotten,"While this film keeps the bare outlines of Bryson's story, it both misunderstands his comic voice and conveys it wrongly."
fresh,"Unlike most offerings on the multiplex menu, you can watch this one with your 80-year-old uncle and your 15-year-old daughter. Everyone will have a reasonably good time without muddying their boots."
rotten,"is not entirely without its charms, but is so scattered both tonally and narratively that nothing ever quite adds up"
rotten,"Redford and Nolte plod through the woods because the ""Sundance Kid"" and the ""Prince of Tides"" have gotten older."
rotten,"This one is strictly a walk, don't run proposition."
rotten,"A Walk in the Woods is decent light entertainment; there's just no real meat to it. Without a strong thematic center, the movie can feel a bit repetitive at times - Grumpy Old Men in the wild, so to speak."
fresh,"Sensitive and scenic, it's an amiable amble with two crusty curmudgeons..."
rotten,"In one of the most generous pieces of movie casting ever, travel writer Bill Bryson is portrayed by Robert Redford in this lazy, feather-light adaptation of his book about walking the Appalachian Trail."
rotten,"For as profound an experience as it portrays, A Walk in the Woods in retrospect feels as slight as its title."
rotten,"Decides to go for - nay, strain for - antics. You can hear the brainstorming: What can we have happen to them?"
rotten,"A Walk in the Woods is pleasant but inconsequential, a passing diversion rather than a worthy cinematic destination."
fresh,There's almost nothing here beyond the opportunity to watch two veteran actors play off one another -- and it turns out that's enough.
rotten,"Amiable, if shallow, entertainment, until it falls off a cliff."
fresh,"While this movie could have been an overly earnest drama or an embarrassing slapstick farce, it settles somewhere comfortably in between."
fresh,Some will find parts of this offensive. Grow a sense of humor. I recommend hiking to a local theater and catching this really funny old guy buddy flick.
fresh,"In the end, 'A Walk in the Woods' isn't much more than a lark; but it has just enough meat on its bones to make it a lark worth your while."
rotten,"Quaint, breezy and inoffensive... as well as entirely forgettable."
rotten,"A Walk In The Woods is much more about tame silliness, which leaves us with a dull and lifeless film."
fresh,"While older audiences will go for it, even viewers who haven't acquired the wisdom of age can learn something."
rotten,"The laughs are few, and the homespun philosophy about as deep as a fortune cookie."
rotten,"Too much of the breezy humor that made the book a delight is stripped away, replaced with predictable jokes and broad slapstick, sitcom-quality encounters with women and bears and a pushy, grating sentimentality."
rotten,"A waste of stars, scenery, and setup."
rotten,"The lax, lame A Walk in the Woods is a road movie without a road, a journey of self-discovery without discovery, and a tale of friendship without any chemistry."
rotten,[The film] is for anyone who wants to see two of America's finest screen actors completely humiliate themselves.
fresh,I enjoyed the film to the degree that comfort food extends to frozen pizza: It's warm; it's cheesy; it's not as fresh as I had hoped for.
fresh,Watching these two interact and listening to their wizened characters' riffs amid gorgeous scenery is a sheer delight -- which is a good thing since that comprises the bulk of the movie.
fresh,"[Nolte] and Redford make an agreeable comedy team, and they're framed against some spectacular scenery along the trail that Kwapis and his second unit almost can't help but find."
fresh,"A Walk in the Woods is at its best when Redford and Nolte let the laughs subside, and just relax as two guys contemplating their lives, mortality and the joys of one last adventure together."
fresh,A delightful chance to savor the acting skills of veteran film stars Robert Redford and Nick Nolte.
fresh,"Surprisingly impish, keeping encouraging distance from maudlin activities to transform into an R-rated romp through the wilderness, subverting expectations for a somber reflection on the fragility of life."
fresh,"The star power of Redford and Nolte will attract older audiences, though I'm not so sure for the under 40 crowd."
fresh,The real pleasures are not to be found in the sweeping shots of the Great Smoky Mountains but in seeing how Mr. Redford and Mr. Nolte's characters learn to get along.
fresh,"Depending on your age, disposition, and expectations about movies, A Walk in the Woods is either a soft entertainment or a refreshing meditation on man's relationship with nature, both without and within."
rotten,"Though it is pleasant enough simply to be in the company of these two charismatic old stagers, Redford and Nolte are never the hilarious double-act director Ken Kwapis makes them out to be."
fresh,A fun time spent in the company of great characters.
rotten,"Though the adventure is meant as late-life stock-taking and there are a few moments of sunset philosophy, mainly these two guys complain."
rotten,"Its attempts at broad comedy too often feel like the characters are drawn around the pratfalls, rather than the other way around."
fresh,"The narrative gets a gentle push from Nathan Larson's economic score, accented by harmonica and guitar, complemented by John Bailey's postcard cinematography."
fresh,"The finished product isn't a great movie. But every good actor, and that actor's most loyal fans, deserve their Walk in the Woods."
fresh,"Nolte's performance elevates Katz to the pantheon of disheveled, dissolute sidekicks that includes Walter Brennan in To Have and Have Not, Walter Huston in The Treasure of Sierra Madre, and Edmond O'Brien in The Wild Bunch."
rotten,"... a casual, easy-going film that only gradually reveals a deeper profundity... I'm more than thankful that I could come along for the journey."
rotten,"With no physical progress and almost no stakes other than the increasing redness of Nick Nolte's face, it's impossible for A Walk in the Woods to gain any momentum."
fresh,"Nolte has three Oscar acting nominations to his credit, Redford has one; In A Walk in the Woods they show what true cinematic chemistry is all about without appearing to be acting at all."
rotten,A man in his late 70s is simply not believable doing the things Bryson attempted in his early 40s.
rotten,"If I hadn't known it was Bryson, A Walk In The Woods would just feel like some half-assed oldsploitation version of Wild starring a poor man's odd couple with the comedic timing of a Google Translated Mexican sitcom from the eighties."
rotten,"Robert Redford remains an enigma as the lead character, and the movie would be slower than a Swedish art film without Nolte's inchoate boisterousness."
rotten,The nature of this fantasy is boringly feel-good and aspirational.
rotten,"Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau never made a movie called Grumpy Old Men Go Camping. If they had, it surely would look a lot like A Walk in the Woods."
rotten,"It's like a soft-pedalled self-help version of Grumpy Old Men: Genial Old Men Face Their Decline With Chipper Goodwill But an Inevitable Sense of the Tragedy of Decay, Plus Bears."
fresh,"The two actors carp and quip well together, enough to carry us through a plot with few surprises."
rotten,A Walk in the Woods -- based on travel writer Bill Bryson's book -- could have been more accurately titled Grumpy Old Men try to go Wild. But even that makes this movie sound more promising than it is.
fresh,"A Walk in the Woods is certainly no Butch Cassidy, but it is interesting to check in with these two still-compelling codgers."
rotten,"The to and fro of dialogue between the men never goes very far, and we don't really get a sense of the natural world that the pair experience."
rotten,"It's not a difficult picture to watch. All you want from A Walk in the Woods, honestly, is a chance to enjoy a couple of veteran actors. But the book's comic tone hasn't found a comfortable equivalent for the screen."
rotten,Tonally this movie is all over the place but none of those places are very good.
fresh,Meester and Amell are inventive comic actors who have you rooting for them from the opening moments.
fresh,"It’s romantic, funny and gives you all those holiday feels"
rotten,"EXmas has a snappy run-time and the perfect seasonal atmosphere, but disappoints with it's lacklustre laughs and lack of chemistry."
rotten,"The performances are laughably bad, with labored line delivery and strained attempts at being funny. Meester and Amell have decent chemistry, but this is probably one film they’d rather forget being a part of."
rotten,"I really wanted to like this movie but the main characters were just too unlikable and there was a bit too much going on for it to wrap up into one cohesive, satisfying gift of a Christmas movie."
rotten,It’s a poorly thought-out and joyless seasonal film I can’t recommend you waste your time streaming. Not even as a Freevee.
fresh,"To my delight, EXmas is one of the year’s most unexpected holiday surprises, a warm and highly amusing comedy that genuinely feels like a 90-minute glimpse into a big family holiday."
fresh,There’s a lot of heart as they tap into different holiday traditions with a fresh humor. Amell is as likeable as ever and he and Meester have a magical chemistry. [Jonah Feingold] does a great job telling really endearing and charming romantic stories.
rotten,"Feingold isn’t challenging anything in the writing, simply here to maintain suburban snowscapes and guide his actors through pedestrian acts of humor and heart."
fresh,A bit more patience in the set-up would have helped articulate the film's central conflict.
fresh,"Completely and utterly charming, what a great way to get into the holiday mood! Great comedic chemistry between the leads. Unexpectedly heartwarming and emotional, too."
rotten,… a Yuletide torture chamber …
rotten,"It's Christmas-decked doldrums despite its promising leads. The potential was present, but the lack of stakes, chemistry, and modicum of believability make EXmas a pass, not passable."
rotten,"Kandahar is a typical Gerald Butler’s mindless, obscenely violent action film without a soul."
rotten,"Formulaic chase thriller, that's tedious but is at least competently made."
fresh,"The beginning plants an idea that goes beyond the genre, and the audience can take it or leave it. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Though it sounds like a conventional action movie, Kandahar... subjects Butler to a journey in which he will encounter different characters who are wounded –not so much physically, but spiritually- by the war. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Their new film is a competent war action thriller that shows us the fate of the people who were not able to leave when the allied forces did.
rotten,"Kandahar frames itself within the action genre with characters that fall into stereotypes and exaggerations, even reaching the point of ridicule, and it becomes a simplistic message about its own subject. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Kandahar is blighted by predictable action, one-dimensional characters and a political sensibility that’s best described as jingoistic, jaundiced and xenophobic."
rotten,"“Kandahar” is a failed final product, with interesting intentions, but too irregular an execution. If only it were more tense, and if they had removed some unnecessary secondary characters, I'm sure the film would have been better. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"While the political machinations of how Butler found himself in hot water in the first place are frustratingly muddied... Nevertheless, he's a reliably rugged presence perfectly at ease with what he's tasked to do."
fresh,"Gerard Butler proves he has more in the tank than just thoughtless action with this Middle East-set thriller, which is unexpectedly interested in the people and politics behind the usual explosions."
fresh,"‘…a more-than-watchable star-vehicle, but falling way short of what a gallus unit like Butler should be able to bring to the fray…'"
rotten,The action sequences are not gripping and the quiet moments are as subtle as a battering ram
rotten,"With minimal dramatic elements that are included as a checklist, explosions and shootouts, the movie becomes unacceptable... [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"And though the film's reach greatly exceeds its grasp, it's something of a treat to see the always charismatic Butler try his hand at something a bit more substantial than his usual fare."
rotten,It is a bit forgettable that makes it feel too familiar to the point that you wish you were watching something else
rotten,"It’s not unwatchable, although some of it is plainly unforgiveable."
fresh,... The ensemble gives off an unmistakable '80s aroma that smells like napalm in the morning. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Plenty of action but only action. No reason to root for the characters, aside form what they were , not who they were."
rotten,"Kandahar’s remorseful tone about US foreign policy is ironic, considering where, and under whose supervision the movie was made."
fresh,"A decent action thriller with a touch of political awareness that's serviceable, but, beyond that, there's nothing memorable here and there are better entries in the Butler ""genre"". [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"We give it three stars, but five Gerard Butlers. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The movie’s pervasively underwhelming and uninvolving atmosphere is perpetuated by its continuing emphasis on thinly-developed, entirely lackluster subplots..."
rotten,"I did not care for this film. If I tell you that this is an action-thriller starring Gerard Butler, then you know exactly what you're getting."
fresh,"Very much by design, these filmmakers have crafted a unique antiwar film that allows ideas about the futility of war to rise to the surface."
rotten,"If I’m going to watch this man retcon the war on terror to look heroic, it should at the very least be over-the-top enough to be entertaining."
fresh,"We’re in Butler’s wheelhouse. He gets better in this genre as he ages, and using his native Scotland tongue is always a bonus. Say what you want about his choices after Leonidas, but he thoroughly enjoys playing these imperfect heroes."
rotten,A paint by numbers action film that struggles to find its heart.
rotten,"There's nothing wrong with these sort of movies, but there's nothing particular good or memorable about them either."
fresh,"Butler’s movies exist in a world mostly untouched by reality, as though the golden era of direct-to-DVD action flicks never went away. For better and for worse, “Mission Kandahar” fits that mold."
rotten,How much one enjoys the new action-thriller Kandahar probably depends on how much one enjoys Butler himself.
rotten,Gerard Butler action movies aren't among my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours. Butler's latest -- Kandahar -- didn't do enough to change my mind...
fresh,Waugh delivers a thrilling action film and an adventure filled with heroes and villains we’re compelled by.
fresh,"Kandahar is sturdy, Butler brings precisely what he’s supposed to, a few character actors do very nice work, and it looks good."
rotten,"A superficial gloss at best, a confusing, muddled mess at worst."
fresh,"This Afghanistan-set actioner starts off pretty rough, with tons of exposition and little character, but as it moves along and narrows its focus, it becomes surprisingly gripping, even emotional."
rotten,"Kandahar gets awfully convoluted and takes too long to get to the main mission in the story. The film editing is sloppy, while the action scenes are unremarkable. The movie's worst idea is the secret CIA surveillance room that gets unrealistic footage."
fresh,"Dir. Waugh has a way with action sequences, and given that the mission of Butler's character is to infiltrate nuclear secrets and build ups, there is some tension to what’s at stake. At what point does loss equal futility? The defines war in Afghanistan."
rotten,"Butler is good, but they still miss the exit in Kandahar."
fresh,We get to see Butler in his element.
rotten,"This film seems to want to be about more than just the action highlighted in the finale. However, with the various levels of pontification and introspection, the pace drags to a halt at multiple points."
fresh,"What [Butler] delivers is precisely what fans are likely looking for, albeit in a package that’s more politically muddled than is necessary."
fresh,"It has the virtue of being more than a quotidian action tale of espionage and its attendant machinations. By taking a brooding rather than kinetic approach, it becomes a bittersweet meditation on the idea that modern wars are not meant to be won."
fresh,"There's plenty of gunplay and explosions for the action junkies, but more importantly, the main characters are well-rounded and interesting. So if you've enjoyed Butler's last few movies, expect more of the same."
fresh,"If you’ve ever found yourself wondering why Hollywood doesn’t make films like The Hunt for Red October or Air Force One anymore, you might have found your new favorite movie."
rotten,"Our heroes need to catch a plane in ‘Kandahar’, but this pedestrian action flick never takes off."
rotten,"[A]t some point, someone carved out the ambiguity and ambivalence [in the script] but didn’t replace it with much compelling."
fresh,An explosive adventure that hurtles from beginning to end.
fresh,"The very definition of escapist entertainment, Mission Kandahar is above average Butler, no matter how disposable it is."
fresh,"Don't treat Kandahar like ""another Gerard Butler action flick,"" even for those who like them. Expect more from this movie. Because it delivers."
fresh,Kandahar is not a run-of-the-mill actioner. It’s refreshing that time is taken to develop the players and make them fully human.
rotten,"Not particularly juicy or, you know, action-packed."
rotten,Another one of these? Gerard Butler can't fix the Middle East.
fresh,"As with the other films Butler has done with director Ric Roman Waugh, like “Angel Has Fallen” and “Greenland,” plot and character are simply excuses to get to the next action scene."
rotten,Kandahar represents a so-so retread that will likely become a forgotten footnote in the Butler’s resume.
rotten,"Butler’s latest rugged action hero is within his comfort zone, although the film is less compelling between its set pieces."
rotten,Butler drives another redundant thriller towards a calculable conclusion.
rotten,"You can't ""both sides"" a one-dimensional escape film. Giving your Brown men wives and desires for modernity doesn't magically erase that you’re still equating their existence with evil. The least you could do is own it."
fresh,"Kandahar's script lives in a morally gray area, but the filmmaking is proficient enough to keep audiences engaged."
fresh,"Director Ric Roman Waugh, a former stuntman, frames and cuts with vigor and Butler’s lug mug is always a captivating presence atop his masterful slab of stillness and motion."
rotten,"In case we should ever forget, Kandahar is here to remind us of how dangerous that part of the world can be."
rotten,"As a war movie, it’s not especially insightful or gut-wrenching. As an action film, it lacks energy, momentum, and consistency. As a drama, it feels artificial and manipulative."
rotten,Kandahar is a disposable Gerard Butler adventure. There's just nothing about it that stands out in the slightest.
fresh,This is a thrilling action throwback that keeps your pulse racing and your butt on the edge of your seat. Kandahar is a reminder that great action can still deliver a bang.
fresh,An efficient and glossy action thriller…as long as we don’t think about it too much.
fresh,"The tangle of political interests is so thick you can barely see the root motivations in “Kandahar,” and thorns of personal grievance are all the sharper for it."
rotten,"The film accomplishes what it sets out to do, but it’s standard entertainment that pushes for more than it can deliver."
fresh,"While it's gritty, well-made, and realistic, ""Kandahar"" is a one-note movie with no dramatic arc."
rotten,A convoluted but tedious tale of espionage and escape that almost seems like a throwaway despite an effort to add some sympathetic notes about the damage the American involvement in Afghanistan did to many of the locals.
rotten,The sort of textureless action thriller that sounds like it’s been musically scored by a subwoofer.
fresh,"Another solid, decent action thriller led by Mr. Gerard Butler. Cinematography and sound elevate some nifty action sequences, while actor Navid Negahban stands out. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"An overlong, tedious and anemic snoozefest that's low on thrills, suspense and intrigue. In a double feature with Guy Ritchie's The Covenant, it would be the vastly inferior B-movie."
fresh,Gerard Butler and director Ric Roman Waugh are pros at this kind of mid-level action flick. Well-acted and assembled.
fresh,"While Kandahar is undoubtedly spectacular war cinema, it's also a weighty meditation on the seeming impossibility for some of walking away from conflict."
fresh,"A decent (if forgettable) military thriller where the action scenes come with a dose of emotional weight, and not just explosions for the sake of empty entertainment."
rotten,It's ultimately superficial...
rotten,"Butler is good when he’s in a movie that knows it’s junk and manages to keep a straight face about it. Kandahar gets the straight face right, but seems woefully convinced that it’s a serious drama."
fresh,"Butler represents an old school creed of gritty leading men, the kind of actor who can pull up his bootstraps and deliver a slender two hour escape where the viewer doesn’t have to use their brain cells."
fresh,"Smarter than expected, but lacking in the action one might be expecting."
rotten,"Not only is the pace tepid at best, but Tom is a bore, with at least three characters more intriguing than he is."
rotten,"Tell me AI couldn’t have conceived, negotiated, packaged/cast and scripted this utterly generic road/action picture."
rotten,"'Kandahar' finds Gerard Butler doing what he does best, and while there are some admirable attempts to deviate from formula, the end result isn't going to be regarded among the action hero's top tier."
rotten,"Isn’t sharp enough to be taken seriously as an offering of political and religious examination, and not active enough to provide a hard-charging viewing experience."
rotten,"This desert dry actioner is filled with lazy, laughable clichés and poorly orchestrated spectacle."
fresh,"Kandahar strikes at the heart of geopolitical and human rights issues embroiling the Middle East. Slick action scenes, especially a spectacular nighttime helicopter chase, rescue the narrative from lulls."
rotten,"While occasional bursts of excitement draw one back into the plight, they are short-lived reprieves from the banal displays that not even the actors can salvage."
rotten,"What it does in the first hour isn’t particularly good. Neither is what it switches to for the second. That leaves you feeling as though you’ve seen two bad movies when it’s over, rather than just one."
fresh,"While Kandahar can be a bit sluggish at times, it’s all in service of a film that goes to great lengths to be more substantial than the typical action movie or political thriller."
fresh,"By law, every summer movie season should include at least one Gerard Butler film."
fresh,The year's second best film about an American and his translator in Afghanistan.
fresh,"It’s an action and suspense film, and, like Butler’s earlier 2023 flick “Plane,” a good one."
rotten,"The script...is too much of a kitchen sink and, often times, the story goes into the weed. The resolution to this dilemma by director Ric Roman Waugh is to just leave the ends loose and hope no one notices. That is sloppy filmmaking, to me."
fresh,It’s solid and gripping and tries to do more with its storyline than you’d expect.
fresh,"Butler is like an old battered suitcase of an action hero — banged-up and rough around the edges, but dependable and durable. ""Kandahar"" plays to his world-weary strengths."
rotten,"Waugh knows how to stage bombastic destruction and admirably wants to tell a thoughtful story around that, but he also gets lost within too many characters when the compelling dynamic between Tom and translator Mo provides enough riveting drama"
rotten,"Kandahar is very much a box-ticking exercise, with Butler playing the same kind of hero he has built a career out of."
fresh,"While it isn’t the thrill-a-minute ride the trailer suggests, the action scenes we get are intense and exciting, especially in the riveting final third where things really ratchet up. As for Butler, he’s given a character who fits his strengths nicely."
rotten,"With this past January’s Plane and now Kandahar, B-movie mainstay Gerard Butler has officially entered his Sad Dad era."
rotten,"For ""Kandahar"" to be called an action film, there should be action, right?"
rotten,"For a movie that follows a man stuck in a country where U.S. coalition troops have now finally left, Kandahar never conjures the sense of paranoia and fear."
rotten,"More than anything, the greatest problem is how boring it all is. None of the action scenes have any passion to them and, even worse, they can feel downright contrived. That it then pretends to have something more to say strains credulity."
rotten,"For a film that surely wants to present itself primarily as an action-packed thriller, its abundance of extraneous details becomes detrimental to the pacing; audiences aren’t likely to care about the premise as much as the excitement."
rotten,"...Roman Waugh’s direction…elevates “Kandahar” as a production, if not catapulting it above the generic political thriller heap expositorily."
rotten,If this movie has taught me anything it’s that video game movie adaptations will never be a sustainable avenue for Hollywood.
rotten,"What will be most frustrating for fans of the video game franchise and distributors Sony is that the film fails to deliver the same level of quality as its source material, though newcomers might find more to enjoy."
rotten,Tom is a solid Nathan Drake  Sophia is a great Chloe  Mark was Mark…. Nothing against him but he was nothing like Sully.  As a long time fan of this gaming series I wanted more & left frustrated even with the fun glimmers that were throughout the film
rotten,What started as a video game produced by Play Station became a movie that just doesn’t hit all the notes it desperately tries to.
rotten,"Uncharted is an action-adventure flick, but despite a more entertaining last act, it fails to break the curse of videogame film adaptations due precisely to the lack of said action and adventure."
rotten,"With a predictable plot, rudimentary puzzles, and strawman characters, Uncharted never manages to find its narrative bearings."
rotten,"Uncharted fails to provide the most basic principles of an adventure movie. It is underwhelming and overloaded, without the charm of its clearly Spielberg-ian roots."
rotten,Uncharted heads into familiar action-adventure territory making for a forgettable video game adaptation.
fresh,"While Uncharted rarely veers away from the charted territory, the film has enough fun with itself for an enjoyable ride."
rotten,"If you squint hard enough, you'll see what makes Holland great—charm, charisma, aw-shucks levels of approachability—but none of it saves the flick from being utterly forgettable."
fresh,Uncharted seems fresh in the era of superhero blockbusters. Saying it’s not as great as one of the best video game series ever shouldn’t be a massive indictment as it’s a fun ride with a clear respect for the source material.
rotten,A globe-hopping adventure that manages to be visually boring and charm-sucking.
rotten,"It’s a fun ride, and there’s a cool cameo for gamers to enjoy, but it is not quite the film I had hoped it would be."
fresh,"“Uncharted” really leans on its star power, especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character – charismatic, boyishly charming, a bit daffy, and with an unshakable innocence (even when he tries to talk tough)."
fresh,The film's secret weapon is Tom Holland's natural athleticism.
fresh,"If you are after a relatively generic action-adventure, Uncharted probably fits the bill – although a Marvel-like reliance on digital effects does let down its larger action sequences."
rotten,"Amidst the lukewarm broth of deepfakes and green screen that make for the main entertainment of this film, there are very few fun, memorable moments except for the most stupid ones, and we'd rather forget about those. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"There's just enough that gleams here to be watchable. It's a film with a few shiny coins in its bag, rather than a whole bar, cavern or ship of riches."
rotten,Uncharted plays out like a very middle-of-the-road treasure hunt movie which emulates the likes of Indiana Jones and National Treasure and comes off as an uninventive re-tread.
rotten,There have been worse movies this year. Maybe even this month. But I'm not sure those are more unnecessary than this one.
rotten,This film will not have you returning to it time and time again.
rotten,A new [kind of] bland brand movie prefabricated to fit into the superhero film panorama... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Given the sorry history of movies based on video games -- there's last year's rollicking Werewolves Within and then there's everything else -- Uncharted is probably better than it had any right to be.
fresh,"I don't know anything about the video game... but I A) was able to follow it, and B) I had fun watching to it.... They took the very basic background of the video game and they just told a story."
rotten,We now have enough data to state unequivocally there will never be a truly great movie adapted from a video game.
fresh,... Ends up being an entertaining yet disappointing film. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Despite the big names attached, it completely lacks identity.  [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,It turns out to be a somewhat entertaining adventure romp that is not quite light enough in tone. Holland and Wahlberg have good screen chemistry together and they make for a winning pair of adventurers.
fresh,Entertainment without pretense. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"It’s the kind of film which relies as much on fun characters being clever as it does the action, harkening back to the adventure stories of our, or at least this reviewer’s, youth."
rotten,The blandest action-adventure movie seen in some time. If only we could press the “reset” button.
rotten,"A limp and crude film about a search for lost treasure that feels more tiresome by the minute, so much so that it makes Tom Holland completely devoid of any charm; pallid, insensible, and uninvigorating."
fresh,"Nathan Drake might not sport a bullwhip or fedora, and he might avoid raiding tombs, but the beats of his adventures are as old as some of the treasures he seeks."
rotten,"Fleischer knows his way around a snappy action sequence, but this is all pretty generic, high-flying/low-stakes middle-of-the-road stuff, slickly made and perfectly watchable and all the more boring for it."
rotten,"There certainly was action AND adventure, it's just neither element was particularly exciting."
rotten,"iUnchartedi really wants to be iRaiders of the Lost Arki. So badly, in fact, that it's hard to believe there weren't snakes in the hold of Magellan's wrecked ships."
fresh,An entertaining story with watchable characteristics. Not a perfect film but good enough to invest me in a possible sequel.
fresh,"The laughably atrocious screenplay is perpetually buoyed by the film's tight pacing and strong cast chemistry. Though it often seems to have happened completely by accident, Uncharted manages to be a pretty entertaining summer action flick."
rotten,"Uncharted aims for old school adventure with a modern sheen, but the end result is the latest in a long line of immediately forgettable video game adaptations."
rotten,"...a slick adventure thats been suffused with a whole host of unappealing, by-the-numbers elements..."
fresh,"While Uncharted will never be a classic on par with Spielbergs original swashbuckling adventures, it does no dishonor to that tradition, and even manages to deliver a few unique thrills."
fresh,I like Tom Holland in movies like this. I wish the the action was a little a bit more exciting.
rotten,"Uncharted emerges as a disjointed mess of a movie that cant decide if it wants to be full-on video game fun or slick cinematic treasure hunt, leaving Holland swimming upstream against the current of a story thats as choppy as it is uninteresting."
rotten,"It is wildly ironic that the only references to the action-adventure films of the past that Uncharted mimics with any skill are the ugliest, most outdated elements."
rotten,Its not poorly written for a video game-based movie. Its poorly written for a ransom note. Its poorly written by the standards of online comment sections. Its poorly written compared to an Ayn Rand novel. Its that bad.
rotten,"The best you can say about it is that it's bad, but in surprising ways."
fresh,"The vibe of it is a little bit of throwback. It feels like the sort of silly, fun action movie we got a lot of in the 90s."
fresh,"It is not path-breaking. It is also not as cinematic as its source material. Once that is clear and the pressure on the film to be perfect is off, it becomes easier to see Uncharted for what it is: a harmless action movie that does its job."
fresh,"There's not much depth to the film as it's meant to be frivolous fun, which it is."
rotten,"Uncharted is aimed squarely at gamers, although they're likely to be sent running back to their PlayStations for something a little less bland."
rotten,"Here's the deal. If you have somehow never seen an Indiana Jones movie, Uncharted might well blow your mind. If you have seen one, then you've basically already seen Uncharted."
fresh,The film doesn’t forsake its dialogue and emotions for action. It strikes a perfect balance which makes it a wholesome entertainer.
rotten,"What’s perhaps most disheartening is that Uncharted, which is meant to be about Nathan Drake, doesn’t seem very invested in him at all."
rotten,As flavorless and routine as they come.
rotten,It is kind of soulless and thats how youre likely to feel coming out of it.
fresh,"While it disappoints as an adaptation of it's source material, there's enough big budget set pieces and star power to make for a fun adventure."
fresh,"This is a fun first step, with Holland and Wahlberg proving to be a delightful pairing."
rotten,There's just not enough story that matters.
fresh,Delivers what you expect - a fanciful adventure movie where you just sit back and enjoy the ride.
fresh,"It's certainly easy enough to just sit back, turn off any higher functioning of the old brain, and just go with the flow. And there's something to be said for that."
rotten,"Casual moviegoers will enjoy this generic treasure-hunting action film, while fans of the video game series will most likely come out disappointed. Full review in Spanish"
fresh,"Many of the film's flaws are forgivable because it doesn't take itself too seriously. ... If you're looking for an action adventure unburdened by a coherent story, Uncharted might tide you over until the next superhero installment."
rotten,The storytelling can be kind of lame and derivative of better cinematic art; the gameplay itself can grow tiresome in the more unfocused moments...
rotten,"It's not that much of a movie, but a diversion. It's a big, dumb diversion; the best thing about it is that it serves as evidence that Tom Holland makes for a wonderful movie star."
fresh,"An entertaining adventure film; nothing special, but nothing offensive, either. However, ""Uncharted"" fans will probably be left with mixed feelings. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,High-quality popcorn entertainment in the tradition of the National Treasure and Pirates of the Caribbean series.
rotten,"If you haven’t yet, play Uncharted 4, or watch a let’s play of it as though it were an animated film. The reasons for which it’s better is so immediately apparent."
rotten,The result is serviceable but soulless.
rotten,"Uncharted bites the dust -- and cobwebs -- in a passionless, generic Raiders knock-off."
rotten,Uncharted reeks of cynicism and presents an inept understanding of its source material.
fresh,"A fun, rollicking adventure flick with likable protagonists, fun puzzles and big set-pieces -- what’s not to love? Isn’t that basically the gist of the games?"
rotten,"It’s all mildly amusing, mildly exciting and entirely routine, just as you might expect from a director such as the reliably faceless Ruben Fleischer (Venom), who manages to go from one hit to the next without ever showing any particular talent."
fresh,"Holland is very funny...it's so much fun, and it sets up for a sequel."
fresh,"Uncharted seems like it’s a film that knows what it’s meant to do, and that’s to entertain. Which it does well. It’s not the next coming of Indiana Jones, but it’s an enjoyable 116-minute ride."
rotten,"The term aggressively mediocre applies to many video game adaptations, but we also do not need further exhibits for people to convince us that the National Treasure movies are good because others are lamer."
rotten,"Now that another great franchise has failed to live up to the hype, theres even more evidence that what makes a movie succeed and what makes a video game succeed may be mutually exclusiveno matter how much DNA they seem to share."
fresh,"My favorite movie genre is action adventure, and its rare to find a big studio film that gets it as right as iUncharted/i. I loved it."
rotten,"It's an Indiana Jones wannabe, video-game style."
fresh,"I have sat through far, far worse video game movies, and Uncharted is at least basically competent."
fresh,"Fleischer keeps the energy up with a solid build and momentum. Its starts off with the street-smart logic and sleight of hand tricks leading up to an all-out crazy, special effects heavy climax that defies logic."
rotten,Uncharted is not bad enough to hate and not entertaining enough to engage with. Its just another bad video game movie.
fresh,Theres nothing original about this treasure hunt movie but Tom Hollands knack for action and the character's chemistry is enough to retain your gaze.
rotten,"For fans of each of treasure hunter Nathan Drakes incredibly convoluted adventures, this movie is likely going to feel like a bona fide disaster."
fresh,"For the non-purist, this might work as easy consumption popcorn fare."
rotten,Uncharted is bland and disappointing without being outright disastrous.
rotten,"Director Ruben Fleischer has a good eye for buzzy, well-framed action sequences and scenes that move until they run out of road, which is perhaps the best way to describe this film: a race car stuck on a very short track."
fresh,"It achieves the primary goal of based-on-a-video-game movies, which is that the non-stunts parts like storyline and character dont get in the way of the stunts parts, which are the reason we are there."
rotten,The main problem I had with Uncharted is everything is too easy for our protagonists...and most of the cast is wasted.
fresh,"Winning buddy-movie chemistry between ""Uncharted"" stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg helps overcome the film's weaknesses."
fresh,"""Uncharted"" isn't a terrible movie  it's enjoyable enough with a few sprawling action sequences  but the wannabe ""National Treasure"" is a generic action movie that never captures the full excitement of playing through the franchise."
fresh,"This film was good clean fun with a little bit of history and sightseeing added to the mix. Holland and Wahlberg have good chemistry--not exactly buddies, but close to mentor and student. The crosses are both gold and double. Buckle up in 4DX if you can."
rotten,"Thus, the critical process is simplified because the film sucks both as an adaptation and on its own merits (or lack thereof)."
rotten,"Uncharted drops toward the wrong end of the chart every time Holland and Wahlberg engage in juvenile bickering, which alas is all too often."
rotten,So unfailingly mediocre that I suspect even fans of the game will come away disappointed.
fresh,"This an entertaining experience from start to finish with excellent chemistry between the cast, a number of surprises, and a delightful connection to its inspiration..."
rotten,"Rather than find a way to surprise the audience, this is more of a film going through the motions and hoping the strength of the leads is enough to help it get by."
fresh,"Yes, trust is its own treasure -- and their gold-digging partnership promises a sequel."
rotten,"Makes me wonder why someone didnt find the gold before, since it's rooted in available history, and the two white men break into ancient buildings in broad daylight with no blowback. Wahlberg says ""kid"" more than a goat shepherd in the herd's nursery."
fresh,"I's mostly in good (if not particularly clever) fun, entertaining enough, but with the nutritional value of a bag of Twizzlers."
fresh,"Thanks to some nice chemistry between its stars and smart casting of its two more intriguing female roles, it is much better than the script from Rafe Lee Junkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway they are handed."
fresh,"Uncharted is actually quite entertaining, despite essentially being Indiana Jones Lite. It's not attempting to break any new ground in the adventure genre, it's simply striving to be an enjoyable popcorn flick and it succeeds."
fresh,"A generic, although fun, action movie. If they made another Uncharted movie, I would see it in a heartbeat."
rotten,Uncharted is not so much unenjoyable as it is curiously empty.
rotten,"If less is more, “Uncharted” must be a masterpiece. It’s bloodless, heartless, joyless, sexless and, with one exception, charmless."
fresh,"After over a decade being in development hell, Uncharted movie amounts to a serviceable crowd pleaser. The movie doesnt really gets its mojo until the third act, despite having a ton of action scenes moving at breakneck speed."
rotten,An ungainly excrescence.
fresh,"Fleischer consistently displays strong imagination when it comes to the action set pieces, and once we get through the set-up, these come fast and furious."
rotten,"While Wahlberg and Holland have star power and on-screen chemistry, this is the kind of film that should have us on the edge of our seats instead of looking at the clock. Unfortunately Uncharted is uninteresting, untenable and unbelievable."
rotten,... struggles to develop meaningful character depth and emotional complexity amid its barrage of elaborate globetrotting set pieces that are its very reason for existence.
rotten,Wahlberg and Holland have zero chemistry. Plot full of nothing.
rotten,"“Uncharted,” you say? That’s a funny title for an action-adventure movie that doesn’t stray one inch from the well-tread path of what came before it."
rotten,"As a standalone movie, this is a perfunctory action film that consists of shallow characters who exist to move between decent set-pieces. Its fine, but it could be much better."
fresh,One of those movies that isnt particularly special in the macro but does all the little things right
fresh,"Uncharted had a surprising amount of really cool, completely over-the-top action sequences that I found fitting and fully entertaining."
rotten,A crushingly average slice of action-adventure that will kill a couple of hours but is likely to disappoint longtime fans of the franchise.
fresh,"Moviegoers can forgive a lot if the film has some nice pacing, decent chemistry and a few laughs along the way, and Uncharted ticks all those boxes."
rotten,"Uncharted would seem to have the basics in place, with a decent cast and a simple-to-follow plot. But the film squanders it all on a script that just isn't up to the job."
rotten,"I don't hate this Uncharted movie, but if you go into this movie as an Uncharted fan, I feel like you're going to find it lacking."
rotten,"The folks behind Uncharted know that an adventure movie is supposed to be fun. Unfortunately, they dont know the difference between fun and tiresome bickering."
rotten,"Comparisons to Disney's National Treasure are inevitable. However, Uncharted is more in line with the comic nonsense that didn't connect in the infamous Bruce Willis failure Hudson Hawk."
fresh,The Grinch will always be a great holiday classic. This rendition is perfect for today’s political climate and is very much a product of 2018.
fresh,"Its a fun, harmless venture back to Whoville and serves as a solid seasonal bridge for those already ready to deck the halls."
rotten,Its lack of new ideas or interesting executions of old ones turn it into a remarkably generic experience.
rotten,"When you are working with source material as tight as How the Grinch Stole Christmas! - a lean, mean 26 minutes, after all - anything added is pure fat."
rotten,"It's moderately amusing, but it has a difficult time justifying its own existence."
fresh,Quite rad.
fresh,A feast of festive fun will appeal to both kids and adults alike. Lots of Christmas joy with a reminder that love and kindness is not just for Christmas.
rotten,"[W]hile this take on the story isn't particularly cynical or crass as one may expect, it's also pointless at its core when placed into any other context."
fresh,The purpose of the 2018 iteration of The Grinch is to bring the story to children who haven't gotten a chance to see the original. There's enough charm and freshness to keep it's spirit alive.
fresh,"The 3D animation is a pleasure to behold, while Pharrell's rhyming narration gives a hint of the old"
fresh,"It's not a work of genius, but it is one of the best things Illumination has been a part of in its filmmaking history. Let's face it, it's tough to mess up a classic."
fresh,A festive treat that is a sort-of delight.
rotten,"The Grinch is a good Christmas movie, I guess. It covers all the bases and has a good message but it fails to be as good as other versions because it chooses to do too much."
fresh,This adaptation...finds a way to tell the story anew and seeks to provide more depth to the titular Grinch while also expanding Cindy Lou Who's role in the story.
fresh,"As this is the season for family moviegoing, The Grinch throws its hat in the ring as a solid offering to spend one's hard earned money on."
fresh,A full-hearted assault on cynicism - this is a wonderful Christmas film with personality and charm enough to light up the hearts of a thousand Grinches.
fresh,"A fun family film that is beautifully animated. While not as enjoyable as the tighter-paced classic, the updated graphics can be appreciated."
rotten,"The Grinch takes a classic short story, adds some pointless plot digressions and then seems to completely miss the point by the end."
fresh,"A fun new take on a classic tale, The Grinch exceeded expectations. It isn't perfect, but it is a fun holiday movie for the whole family to enjoy."
fresh,"The Grinch will leave you with a warm, fuzzy feeling that you just can't shake."
fresh,We expand more on the Grinch's backstory...Cumberbatch with an American accent is a completely transformative performance.
fresh,...the Grinch still starts out with a heart two sizes too small and is transformed by the healing presence of a child. That's a message we can all get behind.
fresh,A paradox that only ends up filling with charisma an ideal Christmas adventure to start the holidays. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Despite its familiarity, the new version is effective and heartwarming, particularly as it emphasizes the concept of empathy."
rotten,"The Grinch is bright and colorful, but the narrative feels a bit off from the anti-consumerist message that Dr. Seuss may have originally intended."
fresh,I mean who doesn't love a grouch getting a lesson in kindness and forgiveness from the adorably scrumptious Cindy Lou Who? This incarnation of The Grinch is straight up dedicated to kindness and love...the things we need most.
rotten,"The film's positive messages about inclusivity and diversity are welcomed, but the film is lacking."
fresh,"Fortunately for Cheney and Mosier, the film is charming enough that young kids will eat it up."
fresh,Ramps up the slapstick while adding a needless backstory that threatens to undercut the text's message
rotten,"It's cute and fluffy, but it's not remarkable in its telling of the classic Seuss story, no matter how many variations it throws in."
fresh,"A fresh update from the 1966 cartoon film; its bright, colorful set designs, dry humor, and messages of love and kindness are perfect for the holidays."
fresh,[It's] a story aimed at the very young ... but The Grinch is still a nicely wrought movie that should be a nap-free experience for accompanying parents.
rotten,"He's not a mean one, this Mr. Grinch. And that's largely what cripples the latest and lamest adaptation of Dr. Seuss' classic children's book."
fresh,This new version of The Grinch meets to entertain and enlighten new generations of viewers about the history of that character and promote their message of union and solidarity. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,The Grinch should help get kids in the Christmas spirit (not that some of them need it) in the lead up to the big day.
fresh,... odds are you've already read the book or watched the original. And knowing that The Grinch doesn't ruin Christmas won't stop anyone from enjoying this delightful film.
rotten,"The result is a meandering, low-stakes affair, punctuated by fine but forgettable visual jokes."
rotten,[It] feels about 75 minutes too long.
rotten,"The whole deal with the Grinch is he is supposed to be, if you'll forgive me, a seemingly irredeemable bastard. He literally lacks the capacity for any kind of love. If he's just kind of a crabby neighbor everything is less impressive in juxtaposition."
fresh,"(Nowhere) near perfect, but ... an undeniably fun film to take the family to as Christmas approaches and to remind all that love and kindness can change things for the better."
rotten,"Colourful and amusing enough, and yet, like so many Christmas movies, it's all a bit forgettable - and iffy...Bah, humbug."
fresh,"The Grinch isn't a bad movie, but neither is it a necessary one. And that's OK - he might not be the Grinch we deserve, but he's the one we need right now."
rotten,"The colors hypnotize and the textures surprise, but something seems to have been lost in the translation. Something about the character and touch Seuss. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Whilst The Grinch may not entirely capture the festive feels, the kids should certainly get a pre-Christmas kick out of it."
fresh,"This serving from Illumination (the Despicable Me people) is a handsome, by-the-numbers kids film."
fresh,The animation is top-notch and unlikely to cause half as many nightmares as Carrey and company's grotesque prosthetics.
fresh,"For viewers of a reduced age, The Grinch will soon be all the rage. For those known to be somewhat older, the reception will be slightly colder."
fresh,There are occurrences that the little ones will enjoy more than the pre-adolescents or the occasional adult companions. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The Grinch took out too much, without adding much of anything. It wasn't Seussian enough and didn't add enough of an original plot to hold adult interest. Its humor also fell flat."
fresh,"The Grinch installs himself with an immense palette of vivacious colors, ingenuity and a bet on visual comedy. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"[The Grinch] is excessively well-meaning and very tame. No doubt it will please those who will always love the story, no matter what shape it takes, but you have to be a fan."
rotten,This newest Grinch lacks plenty of magic between some lazy animation and not taking any risks. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"It's the same. The Grinch, other than the expanded story and the upgraded effects, is exactly the same and leaves you with the same warm feelings for the holidays."
fresh,Cumberbatch... does not let us down.
fresh,Humor and physical comedy present mask the frivolous and even triteness of the central objective of the Grinch. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"No, really, that's [it] now: 'What if instead of an absurdly short-tempered psychotic hermit who snaps, the Grinch is a mildly depressed neurotic who doesn't manage seasonal affective disorder very well and eventually escalates for no good reason?'"
fresh,"Little ones will love it, but kids over eight and accompanying adults may be less forgiving of a short story stretched to snapping point for the big screen."
fresh,"The pacing could have been tighter, but overall, it is a fun family film."
rotten,"It's a beautiful-looking movie. Young kids will like it, but I was kind of bored with it."
rotten,"If you've seen the original, don't bother with this remake."
rotten,"It's best for kids and adults who just can't handle the angry, diabolical monster of films past."
rotten,"The one thing a Seuss film should - must! - do is to provide a memorably weird world, and this simply doesn't do that."
fresh,"The latest animated iteration of Christmas' most famous nemesis might not be strictly necessary, but it's still pretty fun - and revamped just enough to feel fresh."
fresh,http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=26227&s=Reviews
rotten,The concoction of overpaid simpletons who have opted for a more literal subtext and undermined the very spirit of the source in the process.
fresh,"This Grinch's brevity and bright, bold colors may be just the kind of thing to relax and get lost in this holiday season."
fresh,"For all that makes The Grinch redundant, there's enough that still warms the heart."
fresh,Was The Grinch necessary? Absolutely not. But Illumination executed it better than I thought.
fresh,"The smoothly animated result isn't as dreadful as the Jim Carrey live-action version, but it's almost as wrong-headed."
fresh,"The film feels very much aimed at a very young audience and it will delight that demographic, but older viewers may be less solidly drawn in."
fresh,"Older viewers may not appreciate the film as much as younger viewers, but The Grinch is not too cutesy and it has just the right amount of Christmas charm to go along with and enjoy its festive fun."
fresh,"It works, as a digital pop-up book that asks us to examine the Grinches inside us all, and find the willingness to let some light in."
fresh,"The Grinch is just a sweet, well-intentioned update of the classic tale, blunting some of the original's harsh edges and replacing its pointed criticisms for a story of positivity and generosity."
rotten,This animated big-screen version is three times too long and 10 times as unnecessary.
fresh,"There's no great originality or charm in the movie as a whole, but that comedy - coupled with general perkiness - is enough to make it an adequate show"
rotten,"This is a film that stubbornly refuses to come to real life, with Cindy Lou rounding up her gang in a way that never really grips or entertains and smacks a little too much of Charlie Brown."
fresh,Illumination's strong suit is creating sincerely adorable characters.
rotten,"Underwhelming, unimaginative and uninspired, this cold and careless adaptation is severely lacking in the zingers department."
fresh,A giddy sugar-rush that slows to reveal its big charms.
fresh,"Fitfully amusing, harmless, and negligible. It neither detracts from Dr. Seuss' legacy nor enhances it."
rotten,Nothing about it feels organic and fruitful; The Grinch feels like it is reaching an end-year quota.
rotten,Just another remix of Dr. Seuss' book that attempts to modernize the narrative with zero intention toward creativity or an engaging experience.
fresh,It's a modernized version of the classic that gives a little more depth to its cranky titular subject.
fresh,"It's the softness that's most interesting, and what makes the movie enjoyable to watch."
fresh,The latest adaptation of 'The Grinch' delivers a satisfying and enjoyable product that pushes Illumination Animation on the artistic front.
fresh,"Sounds like pure sugar, but really it's just sweet."
fresh,"The Grinch is a remake that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does make enough changes from the original material to stand on its own."
rotten,"There is nothing Grinch-like to this incarnation. This isn't ""The Grinch"", this is Grinchᴸᴵᵀᴱ."
rotten,"The bauble is shiny, but hollow inside."
fresh,"Of course, there are holiday tunes galore -- a few new ones and many old -- with all gloriously capped off by ""The Christmas Song"" from the still one-of-a-kind Nat King Cole. And, just who can possibly get grinchy hearing that?"
rotten,"Missing the sort of magic a film of this ilk should have in abundance, and oddly feels flat from the get-go through the end credits. (Full Content Review for Parents - Violence, etc. - also Available)"
fresh,"If you want to give kids an updated version of this story, this works. It's fine, one of those movies that I understood why they made it, but nothing groundbreaking."
rotten,"I'm glad that they tried to make this feel like a true Seuss story, rather than something to irreverent...I just feel like it didn't have to be this soft. It could've been a bit edgier."
rotten,It is as uninspired as it is undemanding.
fresh,I think we're back on the Good Grinch train. It did what I wanted it to do...
fresh,"This movie's heart, and its story, is definitely in the right place."
rotten,It just feels like more cute but disposable holiday junk to clutter this increasingly overstuffed season.
fresh,"""The Grinch"" is a respectable, if safe, retelling of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic."
rotten,"You're a Mediocre One, Mr. Grinch. Those expecting Cumberbatch to add a little Dr. Strange to his take on Dr. Seuss will be sorely disappointed as this animated take on the Grinch buries its kid audience under a blanket of bland.."
rotten,"From time to time you'll laugh and maybe shed a tear, but this isn't the kind of Grinch you'll want to see each year."
rotten,"""The Grinch"" isn't a travesty, but it is completely and totally unnecessary."
rotten,"The film, despite the star cast and even a cameo by the legendary Angela Lansbury, is uniformly unimpressive."
fresh,"Unlike the live-action version, this newly animated edition shares a lot of similarities with the original, which makes it more palatable."
fresh,"It won't make anyone's heart grow two sizes, but it could leave viewers with an ear-to-ear grin. It's equally as forgettable, satisfying, and comforting as a store bought hot chocolate. Sometimes that's all you need."
fresh,Directors Yarrow Cheney and Scott Mosier have better instincts than Howard did on how to bring Seuss' distinctive creations to life.
rotten,"This Grinch pales in comparison to predecessors, especially the Chuck Jones 1967 version with the legendary Boris Karloff."
rotten,"The new pleasantly animated Grinch, from the company that brought you the Minions, is a quaint, frictionless bauble."
rotten,"This movie is so shockingly bland, so immediately forgettable, so pedestrian in its plotting, that I found watching it to be fairly laborious."
fresh,"I'm happy to state, though my praise may be faint-ish / My critical heart is more pleased than complaint-ish. (Review in Seussian verse)"
rotten,The latest big-screen adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss short story has the whiff of a Christmas cash grab even if it inevitably provides some warm fuzzies.
rotten,A franticly paced diversion that should produce massive chuckles from your kiddos. Further proving that the wholesomeness of Dr. Seuss remains timeless.
fresh,Pratfall-heavy take on holiday tale is fun but no classic.
fresh,"Ultimately, though, this is a tender film that tries, in the most earnest way, to articulate the central Seussian idea that Christmas comes without ribbons, it comes without tags, it comes without packages, boxes or bags."
fresh,"The Grinch delivers a delightful story about valiance, compassion, and friendship."
fresh,"It does not surpass the Chuck Jones version (or having the book read aloud by a parent, which is still ideal) but it is far superior to the Carrey film and should become a welcome family tradition."
fresh,"On the plus side, the film feels true to Seuss' style and provides plenty of gags to keep the kids laughing, including some fun animated visuals once the actual caper gets underway."
rotten,Its heart is two sizes too small.
fresh,"The Grinch"" succeeds in capturing Dr. Seuss' world via digital animation, but as a holiday revival of a classic story it may succeed in inspiring viewers to seek the original 1966 version."
rotten,"There's enough silliness and pratfalls for the movie to work as a family outing, but in the end, ""The Grinch"" doesn't really justify its own existence."
fresh,"...not the mess that the live action movie was, and should entertain family audiences. Skeptics will remain unconvinced that there was any need for a new version."
fresh,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a homage to the most relevant Nintendo saga... [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a DREAM COME TRUE for lifelong Nintendo fans and PERFECT DOWN TO THE LAST PIXEL. With gorgeous animation and unforgettable music, Nintendo and Illumination have made a delightful family film filled with heart."
fresh,"Its action, color, and silliness will appeal to kids while adult fans of the franchise will enjoy all the nostalgic connotations. It manages to tell a coherent, albeit forgettable, story with ample charm, thrills, and humor."
fresh,Simple but effective for anyone who grew up with Mario in their lives.
rotten,"It is obvious that in an effort to appeal to a wide demographic, the movie fails on all counts because of a weak script, an over dependence on elements lifted directly from the video game and several voice casting mistakes."
fresh,"Packed with fantastic references that will warm the hearts of those who lived and still live with Nintendo and Mario up close. Along with energetic action, dazzling animation and world-building, and iconic music."
fresh,"If folks grew up playing the games (or still do), and already treasure everything Mario, this is a must-see movie. For everyone else, the mileage in their kart will vary."
fresh,PHENOMENAL ANIMATION!  Short & Simple (too short if I’m honest) Chris Pratt is honestly PERFECT as MARIO (yes I’m as shocked as you) Jack Black might steal the show as BOWSER. But Brian Tyler’s SCORE is so GOOD
rotten,A rather forgettable affair.
fresh,"This fun, visually gorgeous adaptation does the world's most famous plumber justice."
fresh,"The voice cast did a good job and the movie has some colorful, eye-popping visuals but overall it's pretty forgettable."
fresh,"This second big-screen adaptation of the popular video game series (after the ill-fated 1993 film) is vibrantly colored, speedily-paced (and not too long), and pleasantly diverting, if rather unremarkable in the long run."
rotten,Harmless and charmless.
rotten,"Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie feels aimed squarely at kids and fans driven by nostalgia and fan service. Too desperate to pack in game references, too frenetic and too amped up; the film operates at a 10 the whole time. Not bad, just not for me"
rotten,"If you are a parent or guardian dragged to see The Super Mario Bros. Movie, be like Lumalee and abandon yourself to a nightmarish experience."
rotten,Sometimes I get the feeling that the adventure of Mario and Luigi never goes beyond the routine level. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"A harmless, generic blur of kid’s 'content'."
fresh,"Harmless; it amounts to a Burger King kid’s meal and night of Nintendo 64. I’m not sure Illumination will ever take one single risk, but I do think their cheery, color-splosion style for 7-year-olds works for a movie about Super Mario Bros."
fresh,Allow me to push past the Mario Movie’s obvious crowd-pleasing nature and cheery escapism for some typical film-critic pedantry: This thing feels like it was written by a calculator.
fresh,"I think it did a good job of appealing to both older and younger fans of the ""Mario"" video game franchise. It hit all of the points and gave you all the IP that a viewer could have wanted. That's why it's such a huge hit."
rotten,I didn't have high expectations but do feel like it could have gone a bit deeper beyond eye candy and easter eggs. However it is enjoyable as a kids movie meant to hit all expected Illumination tropes.
fresh,"Our heroes have to make alliances, gather an army, defeat the Boss. Powerups, jumping, running, battling Kongs, Penguins, Koopa Troopas, and Shy Guys. If it was an NPC (non-playable character), you’re probably going to see it. That’s it, that’s the movie."
fresh,"The movie accomplishes the main goal of being entertaining for the whole family.  Not 'super,' but definetfly 'It's a go!' [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" unfortunately borrowed Guy Ritchie’s playbook from his disaster of a movie “Aladdin,” yep, there’s torture in ” Mario Bros,” just as in “Aladdin,”teaches kids to bully to get their way...nope, not on my watch."
fresh,"Thankfully improving on the atrocious live action flick, the animated adventure film is a nice 90-minute diversion. The adults who once were kids and loved this game will get a kick out of this much-better game adaptation. Their kids will love it."
fresh,"Older fans might be disappointed in the surface-level storytelling, but it’s hard not to smile at the affection shown for the games’ legacy."
fresh,"Viewers expecting a Pixar-level film were asking too much of the folks who brought you such classics as ""Banana"" and ""Minion in a thong."" It's fun, visually impressive, and, most of all, harmless."
rotten,... The quality of the offering is questionable from multiple angles.
rotten,"A sort of dream come true for the fans of the mustached plumber, full of easter-eggs, details and devotion, but weighed down by a narrative foundation that's fragile enough to bury its commendable efforts to entertain."
fresh,"With its message to siblings everywhere of nothing can hurt us as long as we're together,  The Super Mario Brothers movie is endearing, great fun for families to ingest and enjoy as one."
fresh,"Mario delivers on looks and nostalgia, and whilst there is enough for adults and kids to enjoy here, a deeper story seems to have been kept in another castle."
fresh,I'm not sure what high-art some of these critics are looking for but The Super Mario Bros. movie works for both fans of the long-lasting game franchise and people who want an entertaining escape. This is the best video game movie yet!
fresh,"This lively computer-animated take on the video game just opened and it’s already the biggest box-office smash of 2023. Despite lapses into dull and disposable, it’s also a godsend for parents seeking family entertainment for the 5-year-old in all of us."
fresh,"Adults with fond memories of dodging turtle shells in the ’80s and ’90s won’t mind watching the movie with their children, many of whom have dodged turtle shells in updated versions of those classic games."
rotten,Memo to directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic: seeing corporate symbols go through the motions of a half-baked story isn't much fun.
fresh,"Encapsulates charming classic video game characters within a fun, yet generic, plot that has a cult-classic worthy song stuffed in the middle and doesn’t overstay its welcome."
fresh,"It's very entertaining for children and Nintendo fans, but the story is as deep as a Super Mario puddle and the throwaway references too sparse to even matter."
fresh,"Packed full of nostalgic Mario references for all ages, and it's just fun to see these colorful worlds on the big screen."
fresh,"Fun and entertaining.  The film will appeal most to fans of the video games and young kids. The animation is so true to the Nintendo franchise that you may feel lost without a controller,"
rotten,The Super Mario Bros. Movie has a few worthwhile moments but it wasn’t enough to overcome the sheer banality of its storyline
fresh,"The script may be thin, but getting to spend 90 minutes in this world of Mario certainly put a smile on my face and made me feel like a kid again."
fresh,"You don’t have to blow the dust out of this cartridge; Mario is ready to jump, high kick and spin back into action. Let’s-a-go!"
fresh,"Scripted by Matthew Fogel and directed by Andrew Horvath & Michael Jelenic, this hectic, fun-filled origin story has redeemed the Nintendo franchise's reputation after its catastrophic 1993 live-action movie adaptation."
rotten,"If you’re a kid who spends half your time on a Nintendo Switch and the other half watching cartoons, there is plenty in Super Mario Bros to satisfy. If you’re the parent of such a kid, who are you to tell them what they should and shouldn’t be enjoying?"
fresh,Okay for the adults and a pure delight for the kids.
rotten,"Among the many errors of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, screenwriter Matthew Fogel plops him and his brother Luigi into a milquetoast Brooklyn family that doubts them and disrespects their small-business dreams."
fresh,I've been wanting a Super Mario Brothers movie like this for a long time... I was smiling the entire time I was watching this movie.
fresh,"Is this the greatest movie that is worth all those years of hype and anticipation? Honestly, no. Is it still a fun adventure to see the beloved games adapted to the big screen? Oh, absolutely!"
rotten,"Crisp animation, mostly strong voice acting and fun for the entire family. No doubt Mario is a juggernaut franchise for Illumination and Universal. But overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is nothing groundbreaking and can be very generic thematically."
fresh,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a very enjoyable and fun film.
fresh,"This is a movie for adults, children, teens, and anyone that ever rocked with them Mario Bros."
fresh,"Older moviegoers will likely be turned off by the simplicity of it all, but for fans who are young or young at heart, it’s an entertaining trip down the warp pipe."
rotten,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the Illumination style done at its absolute worst.
fresh,"While Mario has never been about its story, that doesn’t translate well to film. It misses the opportunity to expand upon its lore and characters in new ways. If it doesn’t take a Super Mushroom for next time, this franchise won’t stay fun for long."
fresh,Captures the fun and whimsy that Nintendo is known for.
rotten,"It is the laziest possible version of a Mario movie, and for most viewers, young and old, that’ll be totally acceptable."
fresh,"But for viewers who are less familiar, sitting through The Super Mario Bros. Movie may feel like watching a second grader play a Mario game: It's cute, but you can't help thinking about all the other things you could be doing with your time."
fresh,"Safe and predictable, but not necessarily in a bad way."
fresh,The sneaky surprise here is Jack Black playing Bowser... he's hilarious.
rotten,The missing ingredient for those adult audiences is any kind of wit or clever dialogue in the film's screenplay...
fresh,"Fast-paced and entertaining, if also lacking any real emotional substance, it works best as an homage to the games."
fresh,The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a little too afraid to stray from the brothers' origins for its own good but delivers an entertaining adventure all the same.
rotten,"An impressive Hollywood A-list voice cast and a script filled with nods to the video game series adds to the appeal, although by about the hour mark, you might well feel this is just one long chase movie."
fresh,Watching this movie transported me back to the turn of the millennium when I first entered the colorful Mushroom Kingdom myself on my Game Boys.
rotten,"It is, when all is said and done, intensely mediocre: prettier than a lot of animated mediocrity, but ""pretty"" only takes us so far."
fresh,"I went to see this with my boyfriend's 9-year-old brother,  and watching the pure joy on his face made me fall in love with this film."
fresh,"Adults might wish there were a few sharper jokes, but at least there’s a nice deliberate silliness in the way the film delivers the required scenes without fussing over explanations."
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is designed to be looked at, with goofball humor that kids will like."
fresh,A simple fun story. I was a fan!
rotten,The whole package is a deranged mishmash of overstimulating elements.
fresh,"Fans of The Mario Bros can take to the streets and cheer, as justice gets done to the characters they covet."
fresh,"The Super Mario Brothers Movie is a sweet, funny, action packed and beautifully animated film with a touching underdog story, some fantastic world building that honors the game, and great VO work from this cast, especially Chris Pratt and Jack Black."
rotten,"It’s fan service above all else, regressively so. Structuring a threadbare story around iconography linked to source material just isn’t enough."
fresh,"Super Mario Bros. has been one of the most popular video games for nearly 40 years, and watching this joyous, colorful concoction it's easy to see why."
rotten,A frantic Easter egg hunt of a film that does the bare minimum to please its loyal existing fanbase.
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie was made for the fans. If you love the Mario games, or Nintendo in general, you'll have a lot of fun."
rotten,"'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is super-nostalgic but not super-fun.  Granted, I haven't regularly played home video games since NBA Jam, circa 1995."
rotten,"I wasn’t expecting Pixar, but the heroes end where they started, not having been transformed by their experiences or learning anything from them."
fresh,"Leaning heavily into nostalgia The Super Mario Bros. Movie delivers fun action sequences. However, an over-reliance on Easter Eggs and pop music dampens the fun."
rotten,"So much of the action in The Super Mario Bros. Movie is predicated on the gameplay itself, which certainly makes sense in theory, but is rendered here with all of the subtlety of a barrel-throwing gorilla, consistency be damned."
fresh,The creative team seems to rely heavily on the nostalgia and the silliness of it all over taking this in a bold and new direction like The LEGO Movie.
fresh,"""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" is bombastic, silly and full of energy. Driven by spectacular voice work provided by an A-list cast the film gets props for both being able to appeal to fans of the game and just regular viewers. It's a very fun watch."
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie warps you back into childhood with nostalgia and dino eggs. Impeccably animated with a score that’s an utter delight, the film captures the charm and appeal the game has evoked for decades."
rotten,"Mario’s animated movie debut is too safe and passive, more content with referencing its source material than playing with it."
fresh,"If 2023's The Super Mario Bros Movie is a response to its predecessor, it's a happily dutiful one, doing its utmost to copy the video game. The strongest feeling it inspires: making viewers want to bust out their old NES or SNES or Game Boy."
fresh,"More true to the game than the 90s abomination, but still just a silly cartoon mostly for kids."
fresh,The film belts along with an assault of candy colours and a commendable command of canonical detail.
rotten,"Nostalgia might be the only thing that warps you through this one dimensional adaptation. Though peppered with candy coated visuals and chock full of easter eggs for hardcore Nintendo fans, the story (or lack thereof) leaves one wanting a power up."
rotten,"What it seems to have forgotten is creating an engaging story. It's bland, uninteresting and cobbled together."
fresh,This is a love letter to the world of Super Mario and a joy to dive into.
fresh,While The Super Mario Bros. Movie’s ambitions don’t stretch far beyond telling a competent story featuring these beloved characters… it at least succeeds at that.
rotten,It’s emotionally bland and yet garish enough to psychologically sedate the pre-teen Easter audience.
fresh,"Not to give damning praise, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie sets its narrative sights refreshingly low. ... It trusts the cultural cache of Mario and decides to jump straight into the fun of what people love about the games."
fresh,"It’s a great, fun, beautifully animated story of Mario, Luigi, Toad, Peach, Donkey Kong and a colorful, zany cast of Nintendo characters."
rotten,If you’re hoping for an experience that will unite the generations around a lovely piece of popcorn cinema ... Dungeons & Dragons is still playing.
fresh,“The Super Mario Bros.” Movie is an entertaining adaptation that stays true to its source material. A dream come true to fans who’ve played the game religiously and a visually stunning animated feature for the kiddos.
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a joyous event that will bring excitement to all longtime Nintendo fans and players, giving them a new generational story that they can share with their children and families. This movie is playing with power."
fresh,"... It's aimed squarely at children, and different again in that it feels rather desperately derivative. But — and it's a pint-sized 'but' — I watched it in a cinema full of kids, and most of them laughed all the way through."
fresh,"Although its humor and story is aimed more toward kids, this animated adaptation of the beloved video game franchise offers a fun and colorful ride for everyone. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Assaults audiences with lots of action and color, but not much reason to care."
fresh,"The story's admittedly thin, but this pure fun adaptation incorporates lots of power-up elements directly from the video games, plus easter eggs and some nice voice work from Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy and Jack Black."
fresh,"[The Movie] is fun, it’s funny, and it pays great respect to the source material..."
fresh,"Anticipating that the film might play like a 92-minute Nintendo commercial is understandable. Thankfully, thought clearly went into making the references feel organic."
rotten,"It's vibrantly animated, has wonderful remixed video game music, and is full of nostalgic references from Nintendo's famous IP. But the plot and writing are so lazy, so completely hollow, that there's nothing super here. Forgettable, disappointing fun."
fresh,"Don’t expect cinematic greatness or Oscar-worthy drama, but it does what it sets out to do… create a fun and nostalgic experience that families can have fun with."
fresh,"I'm still entertained by it. I still like the Easter eggs. Brian Tyler's score is amazing in this with the blending of the different themes from Mario, while making it very orchestral and cinematic and just a lot of fun."
fresh,"A light, fun-filled nostalgia trip, with enough charm and cool animation visuals to carry it across the finish line. That said, its also too safe for its own good. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Kids may have the time of their lives watching The Super Mario Bros. Movie, but for most adults, this is game over."
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie brings the vibrant world of the popular video game franchise to life on the big screen. However, the thinly written plot and lacklustre dialogue make it clear that this movie was made more for fans than general audience."
rotten,"An 80-minute speed-run through Mario World, with little in the way of the fun that actually makes the video games themselves special, crammed full of generic fan service that will be lost on at least half of the viewers."
rotten,The Super Mario Bros Movie’s trite and forgettable storyline could have used a power-up or three.
fresh,"A breathless, hilarious, knockabout action-adventure that might be slight on plot, but delivers on thrills and laughs, as well as Easter Eggs and fan service for anyone who has played a Mario Nintendo game."
rotten,"A dayglo sugar rush that will leave the most rabid gamer bewildered, Super Mario Bros. The Movie gives the 8-bit hit the poppy computer animation treatment but it ain’t worth two bits."
fresh,"Kids will enjoy it because they'll recognise characters and scenes they're used to playing, and adults because they used to play them, whether that was on a DS, a Game Boy or an N64"
fresh,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is sure to satisfy fans of the games, but it is so imaginative and clever that it will still play well for anyone who doesn’t know the difference between a Sega and a Nintendo."
fresh,"You can put ""seeing The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" under the list of parental duties."
rotten,"I found myself wanting more, as if I was only getting part of the experience. But The Super Mario Bros Movie is not intended to work in the same way that conventional films do. It’s not about cinematic enjoyment; it’s about expanding a brand."
rotten,Entering these various worlds and kingdoms felt more like an assault on the senses than a visit to any sort of magical destination; the subpar animation style doesn’t help sell the wonder of it all either.
rotten,"Colorful, energetic and empty as a sugar-laden breakfast cereal, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is the kind of kid film that gives kid films a bad reputation."
fresh,"Bright, bouncy, colorful, has a few laughs, and is faithful to the source material. Those unfamiliar with the games will be confused, but I think most Mario fans will enjoy it."
rotten,Payne stretches the film for well over two hours and never quite realizes the possibilities of his central conceit.
rotten,Medium-sized disappointment...
fresh,"Downsizing sticks in one's memory less because of the depth of its analysis than its slightly muddled, chaotic, well-meaning, bemused, troubled concern for humanity and its future."
fresh,For all its ingenuity gets bogged down in its second half.
rotten,Chau's performance is the film's highlight.
rotten,"[Downsizing]doesn't quite compensate for the placidity and silliness of Paul's core existential crises, or his flirtation with deterministic serendipity"
rotten,"By the standards of an experienced writer/director no less, Downsizing is an aggravating, half-baked idea with no teeth in its mouth and no end in sight."
rotten,"Every choice leads down the most boring, self-indulgent path, and the destination is this empty void of a movie."
rotten,The story and its metaphorical messages about life aren't difficult to decipher. It's that I didn't care enough about most of the characters to want to embrace anything they were trying to say.
rotten,This movie ruined me.
rotten,I physically hated this movie.
rotten,Downsizing fails because it is neither fish nor fowl. It can't commit as a science-fiction film and it never becomes the biting social satire the first act seems to intimate.
rotten,"Too bad Hong Chau's character showed up so late in the film, she could have possibly saved it..."
rotten,"By far director Alexander Payne's worst film to date, it has plots for about five movies, all undercooked."
rotten,"Despite its clever premise, certain cliché plot elements make Downsizing predictable and ironically, unoriginal."
fresh,"Thoughtful, imaginative and deeply compassionate."
rotten,"Alexander Payne may have started this project with big ambitions, but, unfortunately this film caused us to downsize our expectations."
fresh,"Downsizing gets increasingly more devastating as it inches through its 135-minute duration, but reminds you that being human and compassionate has nothing to do with how big you are."
fresh,"It is comforting that at this point, there is someone with enough faith in the human race to sign a feel-good movie as frank, naive and optimistic as this one. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Hong Chau's performance is superb, and she roots the movie in emotions that heretofore had largely been missing."
rotten,A rare miss for Alexander Payne.
rotten,"Just does not work, losing itself among political ambitions that are both painfully on the nose and woefully undercooked."
rotten,"With our protagonist's motivations unclear, so too is the point of the film."
fresh,"Honey, they shrunk Matt Damon in a hilariously surreal sci-fi comedy -- although they should have downsized the second half ."
rotten,"Alexander Payne's Downsizing is visually stunning, but it doesn't live up to all of its pretentious ambitions. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Downsizing is mostly a disappointment because it feels like a waste of a brilliant idea.
fresh,"Payne's script has a tendency to meander (making room for plenty of cameos), and Downsizing is overlong, but the world it creates is so simultaneously fascinating and horrifying that you don't mind spending some more time there."
rotten,Downsizing is fuddled and over crowded with little to no conflict to take the story forward. It's a beautiful looking film - with plush green vistas and sleek picturisation - that completely lacks substance.
fresh,"The first half of the movie is quite good, engaging and funny in a thoughtful way. Unfortunately, the plot gets weighed down by unnecessary additions that cause it to feel a bit heavy-handed."
rotten,"Oscillating considerably in tone and mood, Downsizing abruptly jumps from a poignant drama to a bleached pseudo-thriller, and then to a bland comedy."
rotten,"Downsizing was simply just not a good movie, in my opinion. I wanted it to be good mainly because the concept seemed really original."
fresh,Downsizing dares to ask if humans will be ready to make the sacrifices necessary for the survival and preservation of the species is on the line.
rotten,"What a disappointment Downsizingturns out to be, a nearly complete waste of an incredibly original concept from director Alexander Payne."
rotten,"Initially it has a magnetic pull, its premise familiar yet scarily out there. But then come a whole new batch of questions and answers, spinning in different directions, and the film can't maintain that initial excitement, wonder, and indeed cruelty."
rotten,"Fails to capitalize on the ""man shrinks"" concept in any meaningful way, shape, or size."
rotten,It's a real dud and (pardon the pun) a BIG letdown of a movie.
rotten,"So far so good; still synapses-igniting and discussion-worthy. Had craft been chosen over concept, Downsizing would have remained so and avoided a spectacular self-immolation."
rotten,"Once it's proven the plot is going to its logically generic conclusion, I realized the fun had stopped."
fresh,"Alexander Payne makes deadpan comedy...I loved this movie, and it evolves in ways I could have never predicted."
rotten,"What starts out as an intriguing idea swerves into an unexpected, unwelcome and irreparably clunky territory."
fresh,"Downsizing transcends its own gimmick, even if we chuckle we realize that the way things are going, it's not that bad of an idea."
fresh,"The global community writ small is kind of fascinating, a microcosm of all the world's excesses and impoverishment in one package."
rotten,All those disparate elements fail to gel.
rotten,"Downsizing starts at a fantastic pace, it looks good and the concept is intriguing but ultimately it loses its way."
rotten,"For a film that markets itself as a man's journey to self-discovery, the film needs a journey to find itself."
rotten,"I was wooed to this film by the promise of tiny people and their miniature accessories, and I paid a price of over two hours of wasted casting potential, wasted concept potential and mostly wasted time."
rotten,Downsizing is both ambitious and fundamentally problematic. Caricature of minority characters and low emotional stakes keep it from being a powerful apocalyptic allegory.
rotten,"Once Paul and Tran get together, the movie becomes something else entirely: Boring, predictable, and...small."
rotten,"Overall, Downsizing feigns at many themes and embraces none, a sampler platter of personal growth, consumerism, climate change, fresh starts, and apocalypse survival."
fresh,"It's a smart idea, and Payne uses the first third of his film to investigate it from many different angles-psychologically, environmentally, even scientifically."
fresh,We have a movie that establishes its premise impressively well before ultimately losing its intrigue and sheen as things play out.
rotten,"Just when Downsizing seems to be cruising on a steady track, it starts fracturing, fragmenting, and spinning out in multiple, largely unexpected, and almost wholly unsatisfying directions."
rotten,"It's a preachy, dishonest film that practices a continual narrative sleight of hand to keep you from zeroing in on its mushy allegorical meaning."
fresh,"Downsizing finds Payne taking a more ambitious direction, as if having something of a crossroads moment himself...Courageous, certainly. Intriguing, ditto. Successful? Not entirely."
rotten,There's a weird love story between them [Paul and Ngoc Lan Tran] inserts itself into an already boring plot. But even that is not as alarming as the hyperbole thrust in our faces.
fresh,A touching piece of high-concept science fiction with a twisted sense of humor.
fresh,"...an exquisite cast, probably one of the most intelligent comeidies of the year. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Sometimes a change of perspective helps a person to better understand the world, and Downsizing makes it literal. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Christoph Waltz and Hong Chau feature in a fine cast but the entire plot meanders too much in search of decent narrative hinge. The middle act is in particular need of a boot up the rear.
rotten,The really sobering economy of scale about this overlong auteur indulgence is that it cost $68 million to make and none of that money went on a script doctor.
fresh,The most ambitious and least convincing film of Nebraska's talented filmmaker [Alexander Payne]. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"The intentions were good, but nothing worth remembering. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"But the movie which starts with incredible promise and is utterly engrossing then morphs inexplicably into a completely different film halfway through. And so here we are, disappointed and bewildered, reading a three-star review."
fresh,There are good things in this small package but the two genres never quite fit together.
fresh,An ingenious and original premise. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"While Downsizing is not not about the end of human life on earth, it confronts the prospect with minimal sentiment, and uses it to ask questions about what the good life might consist of, here and now."
fresh,"With his latest film, Alexander Payne finds himself teetering uncomfortably atop a high-concept device and wrestling with tonal clashes."
rotten,"It's not mankind that's been shrunk, it's Payne's conception."
rotten,"There are some funny lines here, but the story rambles inordinately."
rotten,"... with a premise this ingenious, one wishes Downsizing as a whole was too."
fresh,You admire the ambitious storytelling and the craftsmanship of its execution.
rotten,It simply does not work.
rotten,"For all the high concept wonders at work, Payne can't seem to break out of his own rut."
rotten,"Because instead of continuing with the wonderfully ridiculous notion of observing a 13cm man try and win back his 165cm wife, Payne decides to deliver a thunderously dull and miserable sermon on the human condition."
rotten,The clever concept morphs into an ineffective and heavy-handed satire in which Matt Damon's character and a Vietnamese immigrant go on an adventure that rivals the excitement one would feel watching itty bitty blades of grass grow.
rotten,"It offers a jumble of barely explored, quarter-baked ideas attached to a laborious plot."
fresh,"It starts out quick, sharp and funny and ends as a solemn and slow-moving leviathan: a movie overwhelmed by its own ecological and human implications ..."
fresh,A disappointing film made watchable thanks to solid performances and some constantly polite chuckles.
rotten,"The idea is wonderful, but it feels as though Payne doesn't quite know what to do with it once his characters are in place."
fresh,"Despite the bloated running time and the sometimes unnerving tonal jumps, Downsizing is an ambitious, frequently funny, intricately detailed movie that is, for the most part, entertaining and thought provoking."
rotten,"Dare we say that this once admired indie writer-director, who made Exhibition, Sideways and About Schmidt, is developing a humourless streak?"
fresh,"It's a state-of-the-nation address by stealth, wry and wide-reaching."
fresh,"A smart, thought-provoking miniature piece."
rotten,"I usually love Payne, but his bloated Downsizing (all 135 minutes of it) needs trimming all around."
fresh,"Payne's lm is full of invention, wit, great scenes and big - if not fully realised - intentions. Downsizing may be about a small world, but it is an audacious, out-sized peach of a picture."
fresh,No small achievement. Alexander Payne re-confirms his position as one of US cinema's premier filmmakers.
rotten,A thoroughly bizarre misfire...
fresh,"The film, fortunately, ends up finding its center. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,[Downsizing is director Alexander] Payne's ultimate revenge on American film tradition. His inability to imagine an original story - to move an audience's basic aspirations without guilt - is another sign of decadence.
rotten,A spectacular premise that loses shape. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,An acute piece of social satire. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Oddly for a film about the ecological benefits of keeping things small, Downsizing suffers from a curious case of bloat."
rotten,"Matt Damon spends far too much of this film in awe, and rather than make you think, it is simply boring."
rotten,"The movie is a scattershot collection of large-scale ideas framed by the irony of its premise, but never reaches its potential for satire or commentary."
fresh,"Working from an audacious idea conceived by his long-time collaborator Jim Taylor, co-scenarist and director Alexander Payne (Nebraska) has pulled off one of the great cinematic accomplishments of the new millennium."
fresh,"While it dithers in what it wants to eventually say, it is certainly a fun watch."
rotten,Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor don't tack enough inches on to what could have been a nifty idea for our greed-filled times.
fresh,"Right now, Downsizing is ahead of its time, understandably rejected by audiences (and in an unbelievable betrayal, also by the critics). They should pick on someone their own size."
fresh,A science fiction fable that is actually less naive than it seems. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Everything is a little on the nose and the burgeoning relationship between Paul and Tran is not interesting enough to sustain the social commentary. That is made worse when the story moves into an apocalyptic tangent in the third act.
fresh,"But [Alexander] Payne and co-writer Jim Taylor maintain their sense of humor, even if the film ultimately feels less like satire and more like a poignant brief for humanism"
rotten,"Then, just when you settle into the film's preachy message about class and racial divisions, Payne throws another curveball in the final act, where Downsizing become a climate change advocate. By that time, it is too late in the game for you to care."
rotten,"It attempts...to be a wacky science fiction, a humanistic love story with a sci-fi premise, satirical social commentary, and even dabs of race and white privilege discussions. But in the end, it's too loosely spread out to fully succeed at any of these."
rotten,"It has way too much ground to cover, and doesn't know how to cover it."
rotten,"By making the political such a sharply zig-zagging personal quest, Downsizing quietly, impressively upgrades the social-issues drama for our troubled times."
fresh,"Although not everything about Downsizing is perfect, it proves Alexander Payne's strengths as a visual storyteller and his commitment to social realities."
fresh,Payne and his co-writer Jim Taylor to tell a story with multiple and unexpected elements within a well determined and defined framework. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Boring, Tedious and Dreary"
rotten,The first half of the movie is pretty good but then it all goes to hell.
fresh,"The trailer is one great big fake-out and, after the second act, the film lurches off in a completely different direction. And despite its tonal issues, it is very watchable."
fresh,"This is a funny, touching romantic comedy about a hard-headed man who luckily finds himself surrounded by wise friends who help him find his way in life. He finds love and purpose in life, despite his foolish plans."
fresh,Auteur Alexander Payne never comes up short on ambition even when he takes the movie's big idea about as far as it can go.
fresh,It maintains emotional grounding amid the abundant quirks and contrivances and adeptly steers its story in unexpected directions. The performances are terrific throughout.
fresh,"Downsizing would have been compromised if it had been designed to please everybody; Payne's undiluted vision is admirable, and you almost owe it to him to try it out."
rotten,"The result is a convoluted satire with so many critiques and messages, it's pointless rather than pointed."
rotten,This movie's many issues outweigh its attributes so significantly I can't help but feel like this will go down as one of the year's most frustrating disappointments.
rotten,"Payne has a way of making amusing movies, from Election to Nebraska. His new movie has plenty of high-concept promise, but it doesn't gel as a whole."
rotten,"It has so much potential, and yet still finds a way to waste it all. A slog."
rotten,"With a little more focus, Downsizing might feel like a more satisfying film."
rotten,"Downsizing does the bare minimum with its out-of-the-box concept, telling a story that's dull and uninteresting in execution."
fresh,What an end-of-the-world movie made by Richard Linklater would probably look like.
rotten,"Charming stars and pleasant scenery are all well and good, but can only carry Bokeh so far."
rotten,"This issue of character development is largely what holds the film back. Without understanding what makes this couple tick, we are left voyeurs in a world that we cannot understand."
fresh,As devastatingly beautiful as it is beautifully devastating.
rotten,"A pretty blur of an apocalypse happens to pretty, blurry people in this dull SF drama. This end of the world brought to you by the Reykjavik Tourist Board."
fresh,"Beautiful and challenging, Bokeh has a pristine look and chilling feel of its own that contributes enormously to the mood and tone of the whole film."
rotten,This is a film for the patient and that patience goes largely unrewarded.
fresh,"It's not really the subject that's important, but how we interpret what's going on in the background."
rotten,"... never generates much narrative momentum or profound social commentary, although it takes full advantage of the gorgeous Icelandic locations."
fresh,Only worthwhile storytellers could take an elevator pitch like this one (the last two people on Earth) and produce long-lasting curiosity about its inherent beauty and horror.
fresh,A contemplative Malick-like drama that leans heavily on its Iceland locations and the genuine chemistry between its two young actors.
rotten,"We're stuck for eternity with two perfectly decent people who, it seems, just aren't very interesting company. Not even for each other."
rotten,"Bokeh's depth of field itself is ultimately too shallow, the focus not quite tight enough."
rotten,The half-baked philosophizing and predictable outcome make the picture an endurance test for your patience.
fresh,"What sets ""Bokeh"" apart among the ""low-key apocalypse"" cinematic subgenre is not what happens, but what doesn't happen. It's the unknowing that is their undoing. The result is a subtle but ultimately profound humanist message."
fresh,"As the story gives way to repetitious sightseeing sequences and melodrama, it proves less than fully satisfying. But there's plenty to admire along the way ..."
fresh,"Small-budget indie films often have to limit their scope and their sights, but Bokeh takes in enough of the protagonists' deserted, lonely world to feel completely convincing."
rotten,"Strives to be meditative, examining art, life, and the pain of living, but it never achieve its full dramatic wingspan, wasting its potential on actors incapable of keeping their characters compelling."
rotten,Unimaginative and unconvincing ...
rotten,"Like its titular aesthetic definition, Bokeh remains completely out of focus both narratively and thematically."
rotten,Generic last-couple-on-Earth sci-fi that's too empty to offer anything deep or fun.
fresh,"[A] subtly comic drama, shot with a gliding camera and a pleasing minimalist style ..."
rotten,"Cheap and pandering kiddie comedy featuring strictly lowest common denominator storytelling and humor, although sometimes so stupid it's funny."
rotten,It's easy to see why Good Burger garnered negative reviews (including mine) upon its original release and why it's a hallowed Gen Y fave today.
fresh,Good Burger isn't a great comedy by any means but there are plenty of laughs to be found.
rotten,Your tolerance for this may be aligned directly to either your age or your IQ.
fresh,"I've never met Kenan Thompson or Kel Mitchell, but they're in that part of the brain where all past co-workers live, where memory is a thicket of colors and smells and jokes you've heard countless times, and so many special sauces."
rotten,This was so bad...I hated it.
fresh,It's not a perfect movie...it's not even a great movie but it makes me laugh and I love Kenan and Kel's chemistry.
rotten,"If you like your burger well-done, you're in for a disappointment."
fresh,"[Good Burger] will satisfy their audience's appetite for basic, messy silliness while leaving many grown-ups mildly bemused by the fuzzy obviousness of its humor, the gawky pacing of its sight gags and the second-handedness of its slapstick."
fresh,"Good Burger isn't USDA Choice by any means, but it's an enjoyable family flick with a nice message about friendship and responsibility."
rotten,Young fans of TV stars Kenan and Kel are about the only ones who will be remotely amused by this misjudged comedy.
fresh,"The rest is a pranky, sketchy romp filled with goofy capers by Kenan and Kel. Together, they generate a kind of loopy charm, taking off from Kenan's woozy naivete and Kel's rubber-faced physicality."
rotten,"There are some cute visuals now and then, but overall Good Burger may raise your blood pressure and, if you suffer through the entire 94 minutes, perhaps even lower your IQ."
rotten,"Young fans will be amused by the duo's dopey antics, but most adults will simply be perplexed."
rotten,"The wiry Mitchell and the chubby Thompson may physically suggest such great teams as Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello, but -- at this stage of their development -- the resemblance ends there."
rotten,"Whatever it is they do so successfully on TV clearly fails to translate to the big screen, particularly when saddled with a script that does no one any favours."
fresh,"Good-natured '90s comedy loaded with pratfalls, silliness."
rotten,A laboriously slow suburban adventure...
fresh,"A fresh, funny, super-sized kid's comedy that may even have a few grown-ups cracking smiles."
fresh,"The meat of the piece is definitely FDA cinematically approved, and perfect if you like this brand of entertainment with the works."
rotten,Few people can be so big-hearted as to tolerate Ed's agonizing brand of pedantic humour.
rotten,
rotten,
fresh,
rotten,
rotten,"Any energetic junior high class could have written a smarter script than the one Dan Schneider, Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert provide."
rotten,"""plenty of ham and no shortage of cheese"""
fresh,Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell [are] a sensational comedy duo the likes of which haven't been seen since Abbott and Costello.
fresh,Anyone who doesn't smile is probably either too adult to count or too dead to care.
rotten,The vast majority of me -- which is not 11 -- wanted several times to run screaming into the lobby and plunge my head into the nacho hot-cheese cauldron.
rotten,Avoid this study of stupidity like the plague.
rotten,"Take any two young people off the street and throw them into a movie, and they'd be no worse. No one could be worse."
rotten,"Good Burger equals bad, bad, bad, bad, bad movie."
rotten,"The little ones may well tune in to its wavelength, but woe betide the adult who accompanies them."
fresh,It's hysterically funny.
rotten,This is just one of those movies that really shouldn't have been made.
rotten,"Although clean as a whistle, Good Burger is what show-biz moralist Bill Cosby should be excoriating, along with booty comedies. Its black characters resolutely carry on the tradition of the minstrel show, under the guise of kid entertainment."
fresh,"Succeeds at what it tries to do, and it manages to be entertaining for adults, too."
fresh,"Although the show is one I expected to hate, I fell for Ed and his band of idiots."
rotten,Good Burger is not very well done. But it does have energy.
rotten,I suspect Mitchell and Thompson are going to be around for a good long while; their clowning talent is as apparent as their schtick is derivative.
rotten,"It is difficult to convert a skit from a television show into a full length movie. For proof, see the countless Saturday Night Live spinoffs, or, if you dare, Good Burger."
rotten,
rotten,"It didn't do much for me, but I am prepared to predict that its target audience will have a good time."
rotten,"Okay, so Good Burger, based on the recurring Nickelodeon sketch All That, is a pretty awful movie... [Yet] the film's exaggerated cartoon take on teen life has undeniable charm and, oddly enough, perceptiveness."
rotten,"This exhausting parade of white people's Christmas problems offers only banality, blandness, and the most desperately unfunny sitcom hijinks imaginable."
rotten,Allen was a bit low energy for my liking but actually came off better in his more sincere scenes towards the end of the film.
rotten,"We loved him as Santa. We loved her as the hooker with a heart. We love Christmas. ... After seeing Christmas with the Kranks, all I can say is it put me in one kranky mood for the holidays over such a waste of talent!"
rotten,"Forget the 12 Days of Christmas; there are at least 12,000 ways that 2004's fascistic Christmas with the Kranks earns the honor as the worst Yuletide film ever made."
rotten,"Unoriginal, unfunny slapstick holiday fare."
rotten,Christmas With The Kranks is the sort of film that leaves you thinking Ebenezer Scrooge might have had the right idea about the festive season.
rotten,A grueling experience.
rotten,"The notion of bullying people into succumbing into the trappings of Christmas does not necessarily represent goodwill to all, and while the situations present good comic opportunities, the film ends up feeling rather manipulative and sugary."
rotten,"Some pathetically predictable plot twists and syrupy sentimentality, which could only amuse a five year-old, lead the Kranks back to their materialistic senses in time for a Kodak moment which shouts a rather shallow Merry Capitalism to all!"
fresh,A more sweet than sour satire that sets its sight on nasty but lavishly honey coated underpinnings of the holiday season.
rotten,"In any normal year this dire comedy would be the undisputed lump of coal in our psychic stocking, but coming on the heels of Surviving Christmas, it's a close second."
rotten,There is not a single lifelike character in the entire picture.
rotten,[A] comedy so broad it barely dents its targets and a patronising moral conclusion that goes against everything its protagonists originally stood for.
rotten,This isn't a wonderful life: It looks pretty hellish.
fresh,"It is a perfectly fine, inoffensive family comedy."
rotten,What better way is there to get into a festive spirit than having it crammed down your throat?
rotten,...almost had me convinced to convert to Judaism to avoid having to go through anything ever again that even remotely resembles this movie.
rotten,"Curtis is easily the most talented actress of her generation to never garner an Oscar nomination. Unfortunately, if all she keeps doing is gifting trash like this with her presence then that's the way it will always be."
rotten,Rotten Eggnog
rotten,Humbug. American families deserve a better effort than this.
rotten,Oh boy. This was a painful experience. Very painful.
rotten,This holiday comedy depicts suburbia as a place where all true individualists are treated with a nastiness not in tune with the Christmas spirit.
rotten,Makes the colossal mistake of making Luther's obsession seem almost a valid protest against conformity -- then lets the neighbors not only win but claim the moral high ground.
rotten,See Joe Roth's movie and you'll understand the true demeaning of Christmas.
rotten,"Contains momentum-halting continuity errors and clownish antics from hammy performers that will have Santa scribbling furiously on next year's ""Naughty"" list."
rotten,Below average comedy that remains watchable thanks to a likeable cast but is very low on laughs.
rotten,Imagine someone telling you the joke about the chicken crossing the road repeatedly for 98 minutes. You have now imagined this film.
rotten,Christmas with the Kranks is a lackluster holiday comedy that can't shake the ghosts of past Christmas films.
rotten,"No mínimo, uns 30 minutos poderiam ter ficado no chão da sala de edição. Ou uns 60. Aliás, para ser mais exato, 98 minutos. Esta seria a única forma de salvar este projeto."
rotten,"An abysmal failure, and I am a worse person for having seen it."
rotten,The type of grim holiday movie that reminds you of all that is noxious and insincere about the Christmas season and then chases it down with a sickly-sweet reversal.
rotten,"I'm making my list of the worst movies of the year and I'm checking it twice, and I hope to find room for this frantically unfunny disaster."
fresh,You'd have to be a Scrooge not to crack a smile during this feature.
rotten,"A nightmare vision of a theist, conformist America... It's like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' except we're expected to root for the pod people."
rotten,There's a line separating holiday spirit from fascist intolerance that Christmas With the Kranks races across in its opening minutes.
rotten,"There's no doubt that the Yuletide has been overcommercialized but that's still no excuse for this miserable, lamebrained exercise in sloppy slapstick and silly stupidity."
rotten,"A dreadful movie, and if you've seen the advertisements you've already seen the laughs -- all three of them -- it has to offer."
rotten,"Christmas With the Kranks leaves you with the notion that if you're not out there spending, you're just not doing your part."
rotten,"Egregiously mediocre and flagrantly ill-conceived in every department, this is, truly, the cinematic equivalent of finding a single solitary Saltine in your stocking and a pair of old tube socks beneath the tree."
rotten,"There's one good gag involving the application of some Botox to Allen's face, but overall the jokes are kind of disturbing."
rotten,Christmas with the Kranks celebrates the fascism of American Conservatism.
rotten,"Movies like this make me want to skip everything, including the remainder of my natural life."
rotten,"Not exactly a turkey, but it's no golden goose."
rotten,"Hollywood's version of the annual Hallmark Ho-ho-ho card. It's made to order: just slot in the perennial Mr. Santa Claus himself, Tim Allen, and stir."
rotten,"Let's be blunt. This is an evil film. It defames Christianity, it's fascist, and while a number of the jokes work, it made me want to puke near the end."
rotten,Luther says it late in the film: 'Why am I not laughing?'
rotten,It's monumentally awful.
rotten,Purports to kindle the warm glow of love for humankind in our hearts but actually reaffirms that the trappings of the holiday season are all that really matter.
fresh,"It probably will not be your favorite Christmas movie of all times, but it is a good family outing."
rotten,It's a paragon of irony. A film based on a novel by courtroom aficionado John Grisham could use nothing more than the cold judiciousness of an egotistical trial lawyer.
rotten,"That Santa Clause guy, Tim Allen, dashes through the winter sludge of another Christmas Carol knockoff."
fresh,Christmas with the Kranks finds a comfortable balance between hilarious and heartwarming. It's the best of both worlds and a pleasant surprise to find under the cineplex tree.
rotten,"it's mean-spirited and ugly-hearted. Everyone who celebrates Christmas is portrayed as a vicious monster, a shallow hypocrite -- if not an outright bigot."
rotten,...one of the most woefully irritating and uneventful so-called comedic Yuletide yawners...a seedless slapstick romp that has all the bounce of a defective pogo stick
rotten,Skipping Christmas will earn you a reputation as a modern-day Scrooge. Passing on Christmas With the Kranks ... makes you a wise holiday-movie consumer.
rotten,"It's a celebration of conformity, a film that begs for laughs by mocking and ridiculing anyone who harbors an original thought or action."
rotten,It often seems like a lost episode of Home Improvement minus Allen's usual TV wife.
rotten,The film becomes incredibly sentimental towards the end -- despite the fact that it absolutely hasn't earned the right to do so.
rotten,Stinks like the unrefrigerated ham its studio sent me as a promotion several months ago.
rotten,A leaden whimsy so heavy it threatens to crash through the multiplex floor.
rotten,One of the worst Christmas movies in years.
rotten,Director Joe Roth misses an opportunity for true satire by making the neighbors such insanely over-the-top caricatures that the Kranks seem paragons of normality and perspective.
rotten,"Should you spend Christmas With the Kranks? Well, perhaps if you're an adolescent boy, or you have nothing better to do, then go for it. Otherwise, make other holiday plans."
rotten,This grim holiday-themed comedy is the movie equivalent of getting socks and underwear for Christmas.
rotten,"Filled with overly processed situations it tries to sell with manic energy, Kranks is canned, hammy and rolling as fast as it can."
rotten,Christmas With the Kranks has the special blend of dumb ideas and vulgar sentimentality that Hollywood likes to dispense at this time of year.
rotten,"This one is a veritable celebration of intolerance, disguised as a joyous holiday film."
rotten,"The modest, whimsical humor on the pages of Grisham's book translates as hyped-up silliness on the screen."
rotten,Avoid this lump o' coal.
rotten,"When it comes to bad movies, turkey jokes are low-hanging fruit. But if it gobbles like a turkey, it's a turkey, and brother does this one gobble."
rotten,Flat-footed holiday comedy.
rotten,Tim Allen needs to stop making Christmas movies.
rotten,"A loud, coarse and witless family comedy."
rotten,This movie reeks.
rotten,"Even if you believe in Santa, you'll never believe that this is any sort of holiday classic."
rotten,There are some funny moments... But they are too few.
rotten,It's possible the comedy contains some secret allegory about the Protestant Reformation but its main message is that everyone should believe and behave in exactly the same way. Groupthink wins again!
rotten,A band of drunken elves working with leftovers from the Island of Misfit Toys could have pieced together a better holiday film than Christmas with the Kranks.
rotten,"It's painful, not to mention flat-out witless, to see two actors this genial play fuddy-duddies who learn that Christmas is coming to their living room... or else."
rotten,"The script here is barely passable and the direction is downright awful, completely lacking in any sense of comic timing, visual grace or character development."
rotten,"Instead of a funny and relevant little bromide about capitalism, conformity and forced holiday cheer, the movie is about as fresh as a week-old mug of egg nog."
rotten,It's hard to say which is worse in Christmas With the Kranks -- the lame attempts at humor or the even more lame attempts at sentimentality.
rotten,"Here's a film that says Christmas is a sellout, that your neighbors are morons, and that suburbia is a playground of fascist conformity, and then it concludes that anyone who actually believes that is a heartless Scrooge."
rotten,"Grisham usually writes legal thrillers, but the only suspense to be found here consists of wondering whether any laughs will arrive. I'm still waiting."
rotten,"In the end -- the beginning and the middle, too -- the spirit of Christmas With the Kranks rings as false as the bell of a shopping-mall Santa."
rotten,"False, littered with lame slapstick, and leaving the impression that director Joe Roth ... threw it together in about two weeks."
rotten,It's a colossal miscalculation.
rotten,"Roth and Columbus serve up strained slapstick routines, a slew of uninvolving characters and tritely manipulative subplots."
rotten,"If Christmas means spending it with the irascible, over-the-top Kranks, then taking a Caribbean cruise really does sound like a much better deal."
rotten,"[R]eally rather chilling, an unintentional Orwellian object lesson in what happens when you deviate from the groupthink...."
rotten,Forget the Kranks going on vacation; take your disbelief and send it on a cruise.
rotten,"Shockingly aloof, and often dispassionately alienating."
rotten,You have a standing invitation to the Krank's for Christmas. My advice... Decline.
rotten,"Agonizingly cruel to its audience and actors alike, and laden with jokes that have been done many times before, and the original gags have never been done for good reason."
rotten,Kranks lacks that basic kernel of credibility that even a goofy farce needs to work.
rotten,"Unless audiences think Curtis scampering after a runaway ham is funny, they'll want to skip this Christmas movie instead."
rotten,A flat parable.
rotten,Joyless and forced.
rotten,I feel more like the Grinch with each passing holiday film...
rotten,"Phony, disingenuous family entertainment, suffocated by its green bean casserole approach to Middle America, spineless cardboard characters and paper-thin plot 'twists.'"
rotten,"...the perfect way to usher in the Fourth Reich...The film's one great saving grace is its almost utter lack of humor, which blunts its potential to propagandize effectively"
rotten,Not since the day I read Mein Kampf and rented Shoah have I had an experience so joyless and laugh-free
rotten,"Does an outrageous about-face, neatly dismantling anything of potential worth and coming out with a monumentally phony Christmas moral."
rotten,"Chris Columbus got the bizarre idea that a Grisham book, even a slight one, should be turned into a Home Alone for grown-ups."
rotten,like spending your holiday with relatives from hell
fresh,"An agreeable, if snowflake-thin stocking stuffer faithfully adapted from John Grisham's 2001 bestseller Skipping Christmas."
rotten,"A USA network-quality script, cobbled together from parts of Home Alone, The Grinch and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."
rotten,A deadpan little satire by John Grisham has been reinterpreted as a shrill and mean-spirited orgy of banana-peel pranks.
rotten,Lockstep suburban conformism enforced with fascist severity is the ugly (but admittedly sometimes funny) joke driving Joe Roth's family comedy.
rotten,A peculiar and at times even sour tale about the tyranny of Christmas.
rotten,A largely mirthless comedy.
rotten,"Given the tinsel-thin storyline, the typical seasonal gags only elicit perfunctory laughter."
rotten,As tasteless and stale as last year's cheese log.
rotten,[Christmas with the Kranks] just made me cranky
rotten,Okay. It's official now. I hate Christmas.
rotten,Hate Christmas and laughing? This is the film for you.
rotten,There hasn't been a more depressing holiday movie since 'Mixed Nuts.'
rotten,Spending 'Christmas with the Kranks' is enough to turn the most cheerful Tiny Tim into a grumpy Scrooge.
rotten,"As I write this...I have just walked out on Christmas With the Kranks after roughly 45 minutes of mind-numbingly humorless, sitcom barrel-bottom idiocy."
rotten,"Christmas with the Kranks wants to toss out the holiday fruitcake but eat it, too."
rotten,"Sacrilegious to the original and apparently the first of a proposed trilogy, it will be hard to keep faith beyond this lacklustre entry."
fresh,"The Exorcist: Believer asks us not to put our faith in any specific dogma but rather in people, in love, and in the fact that your neighbor is experiencing pain, and no matter what you believe, THAT is real."
fresh,"The outcome is a qualified success – a horror feature that tries to say something profound about good and evil, love and faith, but ultimately creeps around the edges of these big topics."
rotten,"Believer is a poorly edited-together combination of ideas that had potential. The film starts out as a haunting mystery, but it slowly morphs into an empty and unnecessary sequel."
rotten,This occasionally jump-scary homage fails to break any new ground.
rotten,"There are moments in this borderline incoherent mess of a movie in which fans may be convinced that its sole purpose is to try making the original follow-up, 1977’s legendarily godawful Exorcist II: The Heretic, look positively genius by comparison."
rotten,"Congrats to the filmmaking team, I guess: they might have made some utter, contemptible trash, but at least it's not lazy trash."
rotten,They need to stop making Exorcist movies. We don't need any more!
rotten,"This was completely unnecessary. The rules were never clear and the various character actions, particularly the lead's, made no sense."
rotten,This is not a good movie and it's even more offensive because the cast is stacked. Not sure how this misfire happened but really hoping we don't get a sequel to this...
fresh,"As he did with 'Halloween' (2018), director David Gordon Green pays homage to a 1970s classic with just enough new touches to bring it up to date. 'The Exorcist: Believer' may be unnecessary, but it's mostly entertaining."
rotten,"The film has good performances, some interesting themes - especially for people of faith - and even a relatively credible drama. Where it fails, unfortunately, is in terms of originality, and more importantly, HORROR. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"The Exorcist is now 50 years old, and luring Burstyn back isn’t enough to render this retread fresh."
fresh,An okay movie that I think will become more appreciated over the years as it isn’t the worst that this series has delivered fans.
rotten,"Despite haunting makeup, practical/visual effects, and editing, the screenwriters fail to take creative risks that would elevate the story."
rotten,The greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world to keep making bad Exorcist sequels.
rotten,"Considering Green's lousy track record with horror properties, perhaps it’s time to perform an exorcism on his career in hopes of salvaging some semblance of a bright future."
rotten,...a half-baked sequel that squanders its massive potential.
fresh,"50 years after Friedkin's masterpiece, the most basic and accessible triumph of this sequel by David Gordon Green is that it isn't a total disaster. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If it has ""Exorcist"" in the title then  it had better be scary. This wasn't."
rotten,The Exorcist: Believer is a plain film in both its intention and its execution. Green's attempt to connect this mediocre exorcism film with the 1973 horror classic is a miserable farce.
rotten,"You need more than head-twisting, jumpcuts, and platitudes about faith to make for a compelling paranormal horror in the same vein as The Exorcist; Believer isn’t even in the same country."
rotten,Any resemblance between “The Exorcist” and “The Exorcist: Believer” is purely intentional.
rotten,David Gordon Green and Co continue to bog down beloved horror franchises with poor story-telling and bloated casts of characters that only further water down the underwhelming arcs of Green’s main characters.
fresh,"Group-think and nostalgia worked against The Exorcist: Believer, with many already wanting to dislike it. Yet, the movie delivers genuine terror, an expansion on possession lore, and a story with a lot of heart."
fresh,"A rock solid first half -- character-driven, strong build of dread, and successful at conveying the sheer terror of watching a loved one, especially a child, slip away & feeling helpless in the fight to get them back. But then it becomes a forced sequel."
rotten,"More of a shrug than an outright abomination, The Exorcist: Believer wastes so much potential, which almost makes it worse than even the franchise's worst entries. At least they tried to do something different."
rotten,This is a lazy cash-grab that relies too much on goodwill from its 50 year old predecessor and has way too many characters. Most annoying is how Believer doesn't have anything new to say about religion; it certainly isn't transgressive or audacious.
rotten,The most grievous sin committed by The Exorcist: Believer is how rank dull it all is.
rotten,Let the power of the critic compel you to skip this movie.
rotten,There's no point in bringing these classics back from the dead when they are already startlingly alive.
rotten,I don't know how you could not just laugh at this film. Truly one of the worst films of the year.
rotten,"50 years removed and filmmakers still think the original worked because of pea soup, head-twisting and vulgarities instead of the terrifying internal struggle of believing in the forces for good and evil. David Gordon Green's is the worst of the lot."
rotten,"Believer won’t satisfy your need to scream. The fright level is low. The movie poster is scarier. The ending was the best, but not necessarily because it was over"
rotten,An unholy disaster.
rotten,"The Exorcist: Believer, a new legacy-quel to the 1973 horror landmark, is well acted, but so what?.. That’s only a tragedy in the sense that Green has shown us he’s an honest-to-God auteur with something to say. But he isn’t saying much of anything here."
fresh,"Offers nothing new to the formula. And if you were worried Believer wouldn’t play the hits during the exorcism, fear not. It’s all there, and fans of the original will know to what we are referring."
rotten,About as circumstantial as a used Band-Aid stuck to the floor of a public pool.
rotten,"Never mind that it's all but impossible to figure out just what the film is trying to say with the exorcism, but it is so thoroughly devoid of any internal logic or basic storytelling competence that I can't explain what happened even if I wanted to."
rotten,"The result is something that feels neutered of its power, banking on nostalgia to mask a weak-kneed retread that's never able to justify its own reason for being."
rotten,David Gordon Green’s The Exorcist: Believer fundamentally misunderstands its source material and has nothing of any real substance to say.
rotten,"The film seems like too much of a rehash of things we’ve seen before. And, despite the obvious effort involved, it still, ultimately, is a bummer."
rotten,"The film’s latter half lacked substance. The narrative didn’t offer us enough opportunities to resonate with the story or characters, so the emotional impact was diluted when revelations unfolded."
rotten,It got some jump scares and that's fun... but not much else.
fresh,"[Burstyn's] presence anchors this film to the heft of that brand name, and elevates a film that is otherwise comme ci, comme ca."
rotten,"Designed as a direct sequel to the 1973 classic, this is merely pointless freak-out horror, technically adept at creating impressive visuals but never coming close to the underlying themes that make the first film so indelible."
rotten,There are samples of formulaic movies that don't result in anything good and The Exorcist: Believer is a dramatic example that it could even be worse. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"It never gets close to recreating the miasmic chill of William Friedkin’s 1973 classic, or generating any fresh frights of its own."
fresh,"However, overall this is a surprisingly class act, with enough devil in the detail to thoroughly enjoy."
rotten,"[The Exorcist: Believer] has the same solemnity as the 18-certificate original — and brings back one of its stars, Ellen Burstyn — but the sense of evil isn’t there."
rotten,...  To tackle a prestige project that’s steeped in Christian iconography and biblical allusions by simply defanging it with kindness is beyond pointless.
rotten,I award this piece of garbage a Zero out of 5 possible stars. There was a day when the prospect of a David Gordon Green film would have me excited. Now...I get scared for all the wrong reasons with his name on a film.
fresh,"That depiction of a particular kind of horror story is extremely well done, but actually, the film loses its way as the supernatural dimension builds, culminating in an extravagantly overwrought exorcism scene."
rotten,"... The direct references to the landmark that has brought us here seem interesting, but the film results in a pastiche of reflections of the past filtered by the contemporary optics of the industry. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Although an imperfect film with good ideas that are not always well executed, it is appreciated that [Believer] goes for a mix between the suggested and the explicit in which the former wins over the latter... [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Odom Jr. shines in his performance as a man who will stop at nothing to keep his daughter safe, in a sequel the slowly builds up towards an explosive conclusion."
rotten,"The same inspirational greeting-card sentimentality about “healing” that induced unkind laughter in Halloween Ends surfaces here, just as awkwardly."
fresh,"There’s enough here to make it all hold together, even if it’s starting to fray at the edges by the end. “The Exorcist: Believer” is not a new supernatural horror classic, but it is a solid, spooky time at the movies."
rotten,"Because Green has always been a talented director, bits and pieces of “Believer” work effectively before the movie decides serious issues of belief, evil and the widening social divide in America must take a back seat to a screeching sound mix."
fresh,Respectful – and suitably scary – continuation of the mythos.
rotten,"David Gordon Green's direct sequel to the 1973 classic starts off promising and has genuinely terrifying moments, but towards the end moves into bad sequel territory."
rotten,Not that entertaining.
rotten,"The United Colors of Benneton angle is so overplayed, on the way out of the theater a pal said he wished they’d gone all the way and brought in a Hare Krishna to help."
rotten,"This is a huge waste of a very talented cast, and another very low low in this franchise. If you were hoping for scares, something to root for, or something at least moderately interesting, this is not the movie for you."
rotten,David Gordon Green needs to be stopped.
rotten,The power of Christ compels you to not see this direct sequel to “The Exorcist” (1973).
rotten,While the first half is pretty strong it starts to fall off once it becomes a legacy sequel forcing a connection to the original. The film tackles some cool ideas but never fully fleshes them out.
rotten,"It requires a rare ineptitude to take what is famously one of the most terrifying movies ever made, recycle pretty much everything (including Tubular Bells on the score) but neglect to include the scares."
rotten,It is very clear that the themes William Peter Blatty established in the original Exorcist is beyond the comprehension of director David Gordon Green.
rotten,"The Exorcist: Believer had a lot of things going for it. They gave the director (David Gordon Green) several balls, and he dropped all of them."
rotten,"'The Exorcist: Believer' offers two demonic possessions for the price of one, but less than half the scares of the original."
rotten,"Much like David Gordon Green’s recent Halloween trilogy, the filmmaker’s attempt to resurrect The Exorcist franchise with The Exorcist: Believer is wildly ambitious. It is also pretty much guaranteed to be equally polarizing."
fresh,"Somehow, the film's all-star makeup crew turns both possessed girls into eerily creepy reminders of Linda Blair's all-time bedeviled victim. Maybe even more scary is how seamlessly 90-year-old Ellen Burstyn returns as heroic mom Chris MacNeil."
rotten,"Apparently, the director is already at work on two sequels. My request is simple: please shelve them. There’s nothing in The Exorcist: Believer that makes me want to revisit this world again."
rotten,"The first hour of The Exorcist Believer is a decent Exorcist movie (...) And then, the rest of the movie happens and destroys all the goodwill that it had generated in that first half."
fresh,Fans of the original film should embrace the fact that Green has entwined the two plots so well but on the other hand the film feels like it runs too long and brings nothing new to the exorcism sub-genre.
fresh,"The Exorcist: Believer preaches more to the converted than to new recruits; the sense of faux religious conviction which was the strongest point of the series is drowned out in a flurry of Halloween-cake make-up, geysers of vomit and easily snapped necks."
fresh,"The young actresses impressively sell their possessed characters; dead stares, ominous movements and menacing line delivery to make the hair on the back of your neck stand up – even if the devil’s profanity is a lot tamer this time around."
rotten,They threw out the playbook. The iconic original had one thing not easily achieved- MENACE. It was more important then the head spinning.
rotten,"Regardless of its intentions as a reverential follow-up, the film doesn’t possess nearly the same ability to provoke or frighten."
rotten,"The Exorcist: Believer does not dazzle, does not leave a mark. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Exorcist: Believer is possible the most cynical and lazy attempt I've seen at cashing in on a beloved movie's legacy. Forcing in a bizarre and wasted cameo and a few mentions of ""Regan"" is all that differentiates this from the dozens of Exorcist ripoffs."
rotten,"The Exorcist: Believer fails to install a crisis of faith, which is the key to this universe.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The Exorcist: Believer possesses none of the thrills, scares, or originality that made The Exorcist such a big deal, spewing the pea soup to the proverbial curb and dialing down on scares that won't convert most viewers to fans."
fresh,"Exorcist: Believer is never boring, but by the time it's over it feels a bit hollow. That still puts it behind Exorcist III and the TV series but at least the franchise is back on the right path."
fresh,"Green doesn’t quite have the verve or creative ability to pull off the subtlety that made the original Exorcist an enduring classic. However, the ideas he’s exploring here are admirable."
rotten,"It’s largely a testament to an almost-50-year-old movie that The Exorcist: Believer delivers so few proper scares, even with an extensive modern-CGI budget and the enthusiastic support of its studio, Universal."
rotten,"It tries some interesting things, but murky cinematography and an unfocused plot fails to live up to the better films in the series."
rotten,"While we get why Green’s film doesn’t indulge, we would have loved to see more freaky gross moments and backwards crab walking."
rotten,I wouldn’t bet against some future boffin declaring this latest episode an underappreciated classic. It meets all the requirements: it’s terrible; many will certainly fail to appreciate it.
fresh,"While the elegantly crafted, head-swiveling sequel fails to reach new heights, it delivers on suspense and jump scares, uplifted by returning original cast member Ellen Burstyn, 90!"
fresh,"As a film, it’s at best serviceable, stronger in its world-building than in its climactic exorcism and nowhere near as unnerving as the original."
fresh,"A worthy sequel the maintains the thematic validity of its ancestor, but on its own path. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"While The Exorcist: Believer is easily the best of David Gordon Green's horror exercises, it still doesn't hold a candle to the original, or to most current horror offerings."
rotten,"After 50 years, The Exorcist has been revisited in various formats, and perhaps the most fitting way to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary would be to leave it undisturbed."
rotten,"It’s only been two months since William Friedkin passed away, but I fully expect him to rise from the grave and give David Gordon Green a beating for The Exorcist: Believer."
rotten,The build-up to the dual exorcism is so terrible it’s almost funny...
rotten,"Most notably, it fails to be even remotely scary. While there’s only two attempted jump scares, the main disappointment is the portrayal of the possessions. The title event gets very limited screen time and what is depicted is not noteworthy."
rotten,"I’ve pretty much lost faith in the franchise, and I suspect the two planned follow-ups are now in jeopardy. But as my twelve-year-old self was back in 1973, I’ll be planted in a theater seat when The Exorcist: Deceiver comes out in 2025, God willing."
fresh,"While Green did a fine job with the overall look and feel of the film and some great jump scares, will this ever touch the original? Of course not. But it does provide some seasonal scares and is fun to see on the big screen with a lively audience."
fresh,"While ""Believer"" has its flaws and really didn’t wow me the way ""Halloween 2018"" did, I still found it fascinating."
rotten,The script is possessed by triteness and the set up is dull.
rotten,...more muddled than a bowl of pea soup.
fresh,"Leaving aside its detractors and despite how far it is from the source, The Exorcist: Believer continues to maintain the core that animated its predecessor: the archetypal struggle between good and evil [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Instead of giving the film a terrifying heart, Green never creates any real scares. There are some moments that startle but that is a cheap substitute for real spooky moments."
rotten,"Exorcist: Believer attempts to reboot the franchise for a modern audience. But in the process, the movie strips out everything that made the original so great, leaving behind a pathetic imitation that hopefully won’t lead to another sequel."
rotten,"Lord, forgive Hollywood for they have sinned."
rotten,My big question is why you’d make a bad movie that so aggressively ditches the foundational tenets of the original picture.
rotten,"The film's reasonably creepy first act laboriously sets up what might have been something good and jarring, only for the script to become a mishmash of barely considered ideas that mostly end up as demonic-hued piffle."
fresh,"For better and for worse, The Exorcist: Believer delivers everything you expect from an Exorcist movie."
rotten,"‘Believer’ twists its head too far. Any smells of a fresh experience are quickly swatted away in favor of a film that operates like every other possession movie, only this one has no shakes and is incredibly tame."
fresh,"Resurrecting these franchises may be another vulgar display of power from an industry that’s been relying on existing ideas for far too long, but at least they’ve appointed a dedicated caretaker."
rotten,"If this weren't connected to the '73 film, it would be ... wholly shallow and generic ... Because it is directly connected to that great film, though, it's also a grave error in judgment..."
rotten,"By the time Burstyn was monologuing about the power of church bringing people together to syrupy music, not only did I wonder if I was watching one of the worst movies ever made, but pondering what the hell happened to mainstream horror."
rotten,"William Friedkin’s original 1973 take on demonic possession was thrillingly too much. This sorry sequel from David Gordon Green is boringly too little. Believe this: If you let the marketing devils lure you into this one, you’re in for an unholy mess."
rotten,"Though Green tries all types of terror tactics from sudden jump cuts to graphic gore, there isn’t a single scare in the entire 121-minute runtime."
rotten,"For most of the running time of ""Believer,"" I was trying to figure out why (other than money) it was made."
rotten,Believer can probably still claim to be the best of the Exorcist sequels. But that's a low bar.
rotten,"For Green and McBride, an Exorcist movie in 2023 is little more than a run of the mill possessed teenage girl movie with CGI goo and few fresh ideas."
rotten,"The film is slated to be the first chapter of a brand-new trilogy, but the only thing it’ll make you do is question what possessed someone to write it at all."
rotten,"This really is a dumpster fire of a movie, so please save your money for something more worthwhile."
rotten,After is also one of those teen dramas where every emotion has to be underscored by a pop-song and a hair is never out of place.
fresh,"Adapted from young adult fan fiction, not much happens in this adolescent love story, yet it becomes weirdly interesting."
rotten,Of such deficient quality that it's unfathomable people will actually pay for a ticket to see this.
rotten,"The music is fun and the scenery is beautifully cinematic, in a way, but the story itself is neither."
rotten,"Jenny Gage's sudsy After offers run-of-the-mill college romance targeted to the PG-13 demographic. The result, a far cry from the lustier stories upon which it is based, misses the mark despite an appealing performance from Josephine Langford."
fresh,"The leads give it all they've got, and Australian actress Josephine Langford is impressive given the limited range of her role. The film looks pretty and director Jenny Gage, to her credit, knows the rhythms of teen melodrama well."
fresh,It's a movie well made for its target audience.
rotten,After makes 50 Shades Of Grey look like Anna Karenina.
rotten,The film's illogical choices and standard teen romance mentality mean nothing that transpires on screen feels remotely fresh.
rotten,"The first movie adaptation, and it looks fairly safe to say there won't be any more Afters after this After."
rotten,"The key to the book's success lies in its artful amateurism. It replicates the tone of one teen confiding in another and in this anodyne screen translation, its intimacy is lost."
rotten,"Where are the real teen romances? This gives us a hint, but the script is so flawed that it's hard to buy anything the characters do."
rotten,...an often aggressively generic scenario...
rotten,A lost opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Full of light, pastel colors, enormous curtains, [a] bubble bath, and loud breathing while Taylor Swift plays. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The performances are spotty and half-hearted, even the most serious of lines are laughable."
fresh,"Anna Todd's novel adaptation is this generation's Cruel Intentions. The PG-13 rating holds back the story some, but stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin have impeccable chemistry."
rotten,"As assumed, After is remarkably horny and corny to the point of embarrassment."
rotten,I endured [the film until the end only because of professional duty. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Films like After aren't necessarily the best kinds of films to talk to teenagers about sex. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"It just...lingers, futilely praying that the leads can wring something out of this material."
fresh,"Because the cast is good and the movie is directed with a certain level of energy, we're never necessarily bored, just wondering when it will stop behaving."
rotten,"Gage's tepid teen romancer After plays it safe and never elevates this youth-oriented, pseudo-steamy sudser beyond its pedestrian pauses of passion. One has seen this slushy session of teen sexual angst numerous times before, folks."
rotten,"When the back-story of how a movie came to be ends up being more interesting than the finished product, that isn't going to help matters. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
rotten,"The real problem with After is that it's a lifeless slog of thinly written clichés, one that's missing the charismatic spark of the actual One Direction boys."
rotten,"A film for fans of the literary saga, but even they might wind up disappointed. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Come back, Twilight, all is forgiven."
fresh,Think Romeo and Juliet sans the poor outcome.
fresh,"After is an intimate look at the ups and downs of first love that takes some nonsensical narrative turns, but is nevertheless a captivating romance."
rotten,"The kind of dispiriting effort that thinks it's scratching an itch for masochistic young girls, but primarily suggests that romance, desire and sexuality aren't worth genuinely exploring."
rotten,The soundtrack rounds up the accumulation of clichés that characterizes the entire film. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The problems may lie in Todd's novel, but regardless, characters act illogically, as though written by someone who napped through most of Intro to Psych and skipped English 101 altogether."
rotten,"After opens with some narration about how certain moments in life seem to define a person, and from there, the clichés pretty much don't stop."
rotten,"An uninspired picture that lives at the intersection of E.L. James, Nicholas Sparks, and the Freeform network."
rotten,Much Ado About Absolutely Nothing.
rotten,"An innocuous teen pulp soap opera that flirts with ""danger"" but, in fact, keeps surprising you with how mild and safe and predictable it turns out to be."
rotten,A patina of high literature... is not enough to counteract the banality and insubstantiality of After. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,This film is closer to Twilight that the perfect comedy of manners from Austen or the romantic tragedy from Brontë. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"This American horror film has arrived in Britain too late for Halloween this year, and I’m not sure its bogeyman will be well enough remembered to inspire many costumes next October."
rotten,"Writer-director Colin Krawchuk saddles us with a poorly written, lead-footed plot delivered in stodgy lumps between killings."
fresh,"Like Art the Clown, the Jester is a great, simple concoction that is creepy enough to enter the imagination of fans."
rotten,"This is often beautifully shot, and it could have been a solid short, but the b-story is poorly written and the mythology/metaphor does't hold water."
fresh,"With nearly a decade of shorts in the book, The Jester finally gets a showcase. The result is a mixed bag. It showcases Krawchuk’s talent as a visual storyteller but stumbles with disconnected kills."
rotten,Wastes what could be an interesting supernatural monster...
rotten,"It's mercifully only 90 minutes long, but even then it’s still too long for the story content. While the concept is solid, especially as the story focuses on guilt, regret, and sadness, the lack of actual content for the story harms the overall execution."
rotten,A “Harry Potter meets Scrooge” hodgepodge enacted on a plateau of plasticity.
fresh,"While on paper everything about The Polar Express seems to point towards the feature being a disaster, the final product stays on the rails to become anything but."
fresh,"Director Robert Zemeckis adds tenderness to this roller-coaster ride of a train, the thrill and adrenaline are constantly offset with unrestrained emotional punches."
rotten,But the technology was not quite up to the challenge of Mr. Zemeckis's vision.
fresh,A worthy and entertaining film. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,The Polar Express is reminiscent of childhood classics of yore. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Polar Express has its moments, but it's not enough. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"There is something indescribably unworldly about this picture, and not just because of the pioneering use of motion-capture technology."
rotten,"The rest is easily summarized: the Polar Express arrives, Hero Boy and some other dead-eyed zombie children get onboard. . .we reach the real Santa, who exists, and drops a little silver bell from his sleigh, which the boy later finds."
fresh,The trailers and TV commercials for The Polar Express don't do justice to the breathtaking artistry of the film.
rotten,"The schmaltz content gets higher and higher, as if administered through a drip feed, until by the end we are drowning in sucrose."
rotten,"People in Hollywood should never work with children or animals, W.C. Fields once said. Maybe that should be expanded to hyper-realistic computer-generated children and reindeer, too."
rotten,"As a spectacle, The Polar Express looks remarkable. As a film, however, it's the equivalent of an elaborately wrapped Christmas present containing a nice new pair of socks."
rotten,"Tom Hanks (in a number of roles) and the other actors do a nice job of voicing their parts, but the waxy animated faces they've been given are off-putting."
fresh,"At some point very early in the 3-D IMAX version of The Polar Express, technology trumps banality and you helplessly surrender to the shock and awe of this big, often thunderous movie."
rotten,"Though heartfelt, the film tries too hard to dazzle and thrill rather than echo its own message: just believe."
fresh,Director Robert Zemeckis once again harnesses a new technology to an engaging fable in this digitally animated adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's holiday tale.
rotten,"Though the emotion feels contrived, that's nothing compared to the flashy set pieces and meticulous detail, which do more to flaunt the technology than move along the story."
rotten,A train wreck of mind-numbing proportions.
fresh,The best kids' holiday movie in years.
rotten,"Even when you look past the unnecessary dangers that the dehumanized child characters in ""The Polar Express"" experience, you're left with a hammered-home theme that says you must believe in a lie to be satisfied on a personal level."
fresh,Polar Express combines good storytelling with spectacular visuals.
fresh,"Digital data produced by adult actors wearing special suits spring to life as both adult and kid characters in this dreamy, surreal adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's popular 29-page storybook."
rotten,"Nearly as much a movie advocating a belief in Santa Claus as a belief in the real existence of CGI animated characters, the film is at once mystifying and uninvolving."
fresh,"It may not have become the instant holiday classic that its cast and crew were hoping for, but [it's] is a sweet, imaginative adventure that's awfully easy on the eyes."
fresh,"Cynics will sneeze in shock; children, young and old, will cuddle up and dream along."
rotten,"As a complete package, Zemeckis' surreal, hallucinogenic adventure is pretty inconsequential."
rotten,More like Night of the Living Dead.
fresh,"What the book does so deliriously, and what the movie only hints at, is that time-honored belief that, as a child, anything is possible and magical characters like Santa Claus and the emotions they represent will last forever."
fresh,The animation looks like an oil painting come to life and the overall viewing experience is awe inspiring.
fresh,"...might better be called The Bipolar Express, with so much that is sweet and light on the one hand and so much that is tiring and humdrum on the other."
rotten,"Unfortunately, Zemeckis has allowed his technical-savvy, circus-like movie to lose touch with its human charcaters, resulting in a cold and distanced animation."
rotten,How many kids do you know who would find comfort in a homeless ghost who drinks his own sock juice?
fresh,...the IMAX Corporation would do well to have this available every year in 3D. They have finally come upon their staple film.
rotten,The Polar Express seems overly concerned with aping real life instead of creating its own universe.
fresh,
fresh,People will be polarized by this well-oiled machine of a family holiday vehicle.
rotten,"Strap yourself in and try not to vomit, because this is more of a theme-park event than a movie -- Pirates of the Caribbean in reverse, a wild ride stripped of its story, down to a rattling series of obvious, underwhelming effects."
fresh,"The story is quite simple, but the well-written script keeps the story moving at a decent pace."
rotten,"Despite some technical pizzazz, this flick ends up leaving viewers as cold as the North Pole itself."
fresh,A warm fuzzy for the holidays
fresh,"Sure, it's overly saccharine and desperately overblown, and the film loses momentum well before the end, but it's hard not to get into the spirit and enjoy it."
rotten,A failed and lifeless experiment in which everything goes wrong.
fresh,"To help the viewer accept the creepily lifelike quality of the animated characters, the filmmakers fill in the background with beautifully illustrated vistas, dark and mysterious, greatly resembling the original paintings Van Allsburg did for his book."
rotten,"Besides its dead-eyed cast, this 'animated' escapade is thrown off the tracks by pointless detours seemingly intended just to stretch the journey time."
rotten,"On Donner, on Blitzen, on Tron."
fresh,Utterly enchanting (and 'enchanting' isn't a word I often use)
fresh,"Enchanting, if disconcerting, feel-good fare loaded with predictable, wholesome messages but crammed with enough Christmas wonderment to off-set the saccharine."
fresh,"Unfortunately, the journey proves far more interesting than the destination."
rotten,"Zemeckis had a chance to do something truly wonderful. Instead, he slaps together something depressingly mediocre."
fresh,Tem imenso potencial para se tornar um daqueles clssicos obrigatrios nas festas de fim de ano.
fresh,Maravillosas secuencias ubrrimas de color y magia.
rotten,a deeply confused Hollywood rendering of childhood innocence by way of computer-generated roller-coaster thrills
fresh,"And while this is a technological advancement, the system still needs improvement. The characters at times look and feel unnatural, their eyes are missing their sparkle."
fresh,"Frequently exciting, a little scary ... and rather sweet at times. Actually, it's mostly over-sweet."
fresh,"Artwork is beautiful, there are some good songs, but the characters lack expressiveness."
fresh,"While the scenic visuals are incredible... the character animation, presumably intended to be realistic and yet have a storybook feel, is at times somewhat creepy."
rotten,"The world of the movie is the stuff of childhood fancy, but it never engages us in that transcendent way that brings even the most hardened adults into its imagination."
rotten,"The positives are more technological than character driven, which has been the problem that director Robert Zemeckis has faced since he won the Oscar for Forrest Gump."
rotten,"has good intentions, but doesn't quite succeed because its animation style is a little too inadvertently creepy for a mainstream Christmas flick"
rotten,My first response was that I had just seen the world's first Christmas horror movie.
rotten,This praiseworthy film has been awarded highest honors from Puissant Guide and All-Fertile Giftgiver Kris Kringle.
fresh,"I found the film satisfying and a good ""G"" rated film the whole family can enjoy."
rotten,"Everything is so nearly real, down to the characters' hair fluttering in the icy wind, that it's uneasily surreal, the way that clowns scare tots more than they amuse them."
fresh,Children will be enthralled but for adults the book is better.
fresh,"Its rich characters, spectacular visuals, and unbridled sense of awe and wonder make this the kind of movie families will want to watch together every holiday season."
rotten,"Adopting ""performance capture"" animation technique, the heartwarming Christmas classic tale is presented here as distanced and cold as its title.**"
fresh,Go in preparation for the upcoming holiday season; don't go expecting groundbreaking CGI...
fresh,.......an unbelievable ride on a truly magical train. This is a film that must be seen on the big screen.
fresh,"The Polar Express is a spectacular train ride from start to finish. The movie is much more than an awesome visual experience, however.....it also has plenty of heart."
fresh,"In terms of awesome spectacle, the movie delivers and should really be viewed as it was meant to be: In 3-D IMAX."
rotten,"In a word, it's soulless."
rotten,"Its storybook look and early energy is enthralling, but the end message is not so much that believing keeps you young as it does guarantee membership in an important club."
fresh,"The numerous kids in the audience responded with rapt attention and applause at the end, so it's safe to say your kids will love it."
fresh,"In the end, the computer wizardry palls, but the story's heart chugs on triumphantly."
rotten,Some books aren't meant to be made into movies. This is one of them.
rotten,A real snoozer.
fresh,... An early and unexpectedly intelligent gift.
rotten,"A film creepy as it is uncreative, The Polar Express creates a filmmaking experience that gives us Steven Tyler as a singing elf."
rotten,"Watch out, all you kids who don't believe in Santa. You will believe. Or else."
fresh,"If you have a chance to see the 3-D IMAX version of the movie, ignore any objections."
rotten,The film falls short of present expectation.
rotten,"Truth be told, there were a few scenes when it felt like this movie could have been more aptly described as a Halloween trick than a Christmas treat."
fresh,"It's utterly sincere in its storytelling ... but [overuses shallow, vague, and sentimental] platitudes until we weary of the word 'believe.'"
fresh,"A truly satisfying holiday picture, the kind everyone can enjoy, and which may even restore a little lost childhood in many adult viewers."
rotten,"Zemeckis stuffs his holiday package with roller-coaster thrills, sticky songs, Jewish elves and a Santa Claus that either looks like Zeus or a pot-bellied monster."
rotten,"Frankly put, this film does not look good. It creates a bizarre, ugly world where everything seems more than a little bit off."
rotten,"Except for children, who might find this a breathless gift, the film's personality is defined by its locomotive: showmanship."
fresh,"It's a kind, gentle and sweet holiday confection."
rotten,"Certain moments will amaze... but these new digital characters very often look stiff and spooky, like a wax museum dummy that you could swear just moved."
rotten,"Its single best scene...comes courtesy of the vastly superior, similarly themed, thirty minute UK animation, ""The Snowman."""
rotten,"Modeled upon real actors though the movie's characters are, they lack the communicative power of genuine human expression. Frankly, they're creepy."
fresh,Aerosmith's Steven Tyler is an elf? How cool is that!?
fresh,"No matter where you stand on the jolly guy in the red suit, believe this. The Polar Express is the most magical, captivating animated Christmas adventure of all time."
rotten,Outstanding visual effects struggle to overwhelm a flawed film.
fresh,"Anytime a movie is this dependent on new technology, it becomes a science fair exhibit for what works and what doesn't about the process."
rotten,All the shiny images in the world can't hide the emptiness of the narrative.
fresh,The Polar Express is like the coolest train set a kid ever had.
rotten,Oddly off-putting and belabored.
fresh,The Polar Express is a stunningly gorgeous work of visual art.
rotten,It takes major issues of belief and loneliness and (implied) child abuse and turns them into a Hallmark card.
fresh,"It's visually astonishing and mostly engaging, but ultimately lacks the one quality essential for a true holiday classic: genuine warmth."
fresh,"Once one looks away from the people to gaze at the gorgeous landscapes and fabulous objects, one feels transported by the film."
rotten,"Without a trace of real live people, you get special effects that are not special, visual talking points without personality, virtual reality that is anything but real."
rotten,"As a general rule, I like to keep my Christmas fables Steven Tyler-free."
rotten,Another powerful children's story dulled into mediocrity by the worship of technology.
rotten,"Many moviegoers may find its colors and effects delightful enough to make the experience a thrill. Look beyond the tinsel, though, and you may be disappointed."
fresh,Faithful to its source but stretches it to the snapping point.
fresh,The Polar Express '...Visually stunning!'

fresh,"With so many resources behind it, you'd think they could have come up with something truly spectacular on every point."
fresh,Une somptueuse adaptation d'un livre pour enfants Chris Van Allsburg.
fresh,The first spectacular surprise of this holiday season.
fresh,"It's dazzling and enchanting, and will get everybody's holiday season off on the right foot. Bu make sure your kids have read the book first."
rotten,"This labor-intensive, high-tech, multimillion-dollar enterprise suffers in ironic contrast next to the spare elegance of Van Allsburg's oil pastel storybook."
rotten,The Polar Express is the most expensive vanity project ever made.
fresh,The Polar Express will shine its light for decades to come.
fresh,"Not only do Van Allsburg's darkly magical illustrations come to glorious life in the film; so, too, do his familiar words."
fresh,"Simple and evocative, yet teeming with intriguing visual effects."
fresh,the heart of the material remains uncorrupted. ...But the true genius of the filmmakers' achievement is best appreciated in the 3-D IMAX translation of the movie...
fresh,"The Silencing is an underseen, underrated film that knows why its tropes work and stick to its guns."
rotten,Well made but essentially dull crime drama: nothing we haven't seen before.
rotten,"Ultimately, The Silencing doesn't say anything much at all."
rotten,"This movie forgets that the character stuff is the side dish, not the main course, and serves an insultingly under-prepared crime procedural."
rotten,"It's desperately dull and predictable - down to the boring reveal at the end. It does moody and atmospheric well, but that will only take you so far. Ultimately, it's too muted for its own good."
fresh,"The Silencing is one of those serial killer sagas that's not so much about what it is telling you, but how it is telling you. And that's where it makes quite a killing."
rotten,Lacks logic.
rotten,"The murder mystery is underwhelming, full of awkward misdirection and characters making idiotic decisions for the sake of plot expediency."
fresh,There was something Karin Slaughter-ish about this film. That alone was enough to hold my interest.
rotten,"A good cast and first-rate cinematography by Manuel Dacosse help, but the storyline falls flat and the film becomes a frivolous mess."
rotten,"After a promising first act, it starts to get lost in a muddy plot. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A pair of fine performances from its lead actors makes the over churned narrative a bit more palatable, but the script from first time scribe Micah Ranum feels as overstuffed as it is derivative."
rotten,The Silencing concludes with a fizzle more than the required jolt.
rotten,"A film with a lot of wasted potential, The Silencing is a serial killer thriller which is nothing to shout about."
rotten,Far-fetched contrivances overshadow much of the suspense in this formulaic thriller that at least features some pleasant forest scenery.
fresh,"Wintry and woodsy, this small-scale thriller is closer to a decent episode of The Killing than The Silence of the Lambs. But it works due to the interestingly flawed characters and fine performances."
rotten,"The Silencing is a decently exhilarating thriller movie, even if the twists in the story aren't always well-earned or well thought out."
rotten,One does feel one's seen all this before.
rotten,"In this stale thriller, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau plays a alcoholic hunter who tries to catch a serial killer of teen girls. Even in these troubled times, when we all hunger for escapism, this long journey to a lame ending hardly fills the bill."
rotten,There is some promise to the setup of the tale ... but Micah Ranum's screenplay would rather play a game...
rotten,"Tries hard to be a harrowing character study as well as a suspenseful serial-killer thriller, and frankly it's mediocre on both counts."
rotten,It feels a lot like 'The Silencing' was written with a climax in mind that the rest of the story was just not up to the task of properly building toward.
rotten,"Slow and grim, The Silencing suffers from being an overused genre that's been done so much better before."
rotten,"For most of its running time, the film is as mediocre as can be, but there are two points where it shifts from the blah to the actively annoying."
fresh,"Director Tim Story and screenwriter Scott Rosenberg keep this one peppy and fun throughout, but it is the pairing of Howery and Bridges as a griping holiday naysayer that really make it jingle all the way."
rotten,Rarely have I seen a performance as lazy as Ludacris in this movie
fresh,"It’s all pretty standard fare, but a likable cast and upbeat spirit make it a genial option for holiday family viewing."
fresh,Dashing Through the Snow could prove to be a season crowd-pleaser thanks to the draw of its charismatic leads and a mostly Black cast.
fresh,"In its way, the movie takes you back: to that Christmas present you still remember, the one that touched a chord in you and meant everything."
rotten,"A more culturally inclusive family-friendly holiday movie seems like a worthwhile venture, but in the case of this silly and predictable comedy, it’s a missed opportunity."
rotten,“Dashing Through the Snow” has all the makings of the kind of movie parents will throw on for their kids in desperation to find something new and walk away in the hope they’re not asked to watch it with them.
rotten,"In film-making as in gift-giving, it’s the thought that counts, and there’s not much to go around in here."
fresh,"There’s a lot to grasp onto, fun moments for the whole family, and the kind of wholesome message everyone could use around the holidays."
fresh,"While it’s shocking to see Ludacris star in such a family-friendly role after his musical work and frequent participation in the Fast & Furious franchise, after watching this, you’ll have to admit: Ludacris was made to star in Christmas movies."
rotten,"The material is treated with such little genuine care, energy, and so few resources that it’s little more than a stocking stuffer that will be forgotten about as soon as the Christmas goose hits the table."
rotten,"Dashing Through the Snow is an occasionally amusing distraction, but a strict adherence to formula is the biggest distraction from a potentially smart premise."
rotten,"Good intentions and much needed representation in the Christmas movie genre, is nothing more than a checkbox for the Disney+ list this season. Diversity and inclusion is left hanging without a solid foundation of story, heart and relatable characters."
rotten,"“Dashing Through the Snow” has no magic or laughs, it’s just joyless. Not painfully so, but when it comes to holiday thrills, Story and Rosenberg are simply going through the motions."
rotten,"Despite great chemistry between Pine and Pugh and amazing production & costume design, the obvious and nonsensical plot and Harry Styles' unconvincing performance ultimately sinks the film. Also: Why is this 2 hours long?!"
fresh,"There is a great film in the bones of the one we are presented with, one that is neater and more compact and doesn’t struggle with the internal logic it presents."
rotten,An array of half-baked ideas that add up to nothing much more than a world of mirages.
rotten,"The ample running time clocks in at just over two hours, and there is no doubt that Don’t Worry Darling would be improved with at least 15 fewer minutes of the simmering dread..."
rotten,Don't Worry Darling isn’t a bad psychological thriller. It merely crumbles under the weight of its own mediocrity.
rotten,"a puzzle box of a movie with an engaging premise that dives into themes of control. Florence Pugh is INCREDIBLE, Harry Styles holds his own, & Olivia Wilde really ups her game as a director here… but left wanting more from the film"
rotten,"If this was expected to be a groundbreaking comment on feminism, then it missed the mark by a long shot."
fresh,"Don’t Worry Darling is ultimately a film about a woman who tries her best to free herself from a reality controlled by whiny, narcissistic men who’d rather take the easy way out than have a conversation and face their issues."
rotten,"There are worse movies than Don’t Worry Darling, and there are certainly better ones too. Some thrillers are better able to blend science fiction and shocking twists with dazzling imagery, and others manage to drop the ball more. Ultimately, it's fine."
rotten,"Olivia Wilde's dystopian thriller is a lovely poison, meaning that while it's beautiful on the surface, it's disorienting and head-scratching underneath – mostly because of that twist."
fresh,"""Don't Worry Darling"" has many imperfections, but it shows that Wilde can do more than indie comedies, and that she is willing to take on daunting projects."
rotten,The plotting is completely incoherent and balanced atop a trembling tower of absurdities.
rotten,"Pugh, Styles, and Pine pour themselves into their roles... grinds to a halt in the third act when we get the presumed twist... it defies logic no one would take it farther. A captivating idea whose explanation rips you out of it."
fresh,"DON’T WORRY DARLING is a poisoned fairy tale, and is a story of the reclamation of the self that is thrilling, beautiful, and thematically on the mark. It’s so on the mark, in fact, that it’s liable to make people angry, especially men."
fresh,"All the same, Wilde’s film has its wins, mostly in how sharp-eyed it manages to be about the violent insistence of conservative male fantasias."
rotten,"The set-up is so well handled that it’s aggravating when Wilde reveals the twist — which I won’t here, because of “spoilers” and because if I start lamenting where it goes wrong, I may never stop."
rotten,"[It's] a good-looking movie, and it has its moments, but overall, I felt like the ""1950s-type-suburbia-are-hiding-something-sinister"" theme was just too shopworn."
fresh,The script's structure (and Wilde's direction) is quite good. I just wish it was in service of having something more to say since its abruptness ultimately prevents it from having to say anything.
rotten,Hollow and disappointing.
rotten,"All style and little substance, Darling has nothing you haven’t already seen..."
rotten,"Actress Olivia Wilde follows her winning directorial debut, 2019’s Booksmart, with a movie that’s scriptstupid."
fresh,"Unfortunately, this is less strong than Wilde’s directorial debut Booksmart. Still, there is superb sound design and an action-packed finale sequence that feels mostly satisfying, even if the resolution could be better than you’d hope for."
rotten,"Don't Worry Darling is a pretty film to look at, and has a partly intriguing mystery on its outset, but it ultimately succumbs to a lack of development and a predictable, half-baked ending that just isn't worth the two-hour wait to get there."
rotten,[A] missed opportunity.
rotten,A repetitive mess that never expands past its first idea.
fresh,All depends on how willing you are to suspend your disbelief over a film that comes with so many expectations and external drama. I’d recommend just grabbing some popcorn and enjoying Wilde’s ride.
fresh,"Bets it all and goes to the depth of its possibilities... For this, Don't Worry Darling will earn lovers and haters alike, but it always plays its hand, like it or not. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"When your film becomes about everything, its actually about nothing. Without that focus, Don’t Worry Darling feels like a knockoff of better movies."
rotten,"It is deliberately opaque. Hard to read or figure out. A cool concept but I am not sure they went far enough. Meaning that it is not fully fleshed out. Plenty was left on the stove bubbling though not totally cooked. It is a shame, really."
rotten,"Ultimately it does not matter how pretty the house that Wilde built is, when it is built on the weak foundations of a screenplay that crumbles under the weight of its own, and the audiences, expectations."
rotten,Ultimately middling
fresh,Layered; a nightmare rooted in a reality that implicates organized misogyny cloaked in coolness and overt social conventions. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,“Don’t Worry Darling” (2022) tells an intricate and visually captivating story about marriage dynamics from a perspective not often considered
rotten,"Ultimately, the film tries to work with too many ideas without giving them one direction, creating a messy narrative that looks pretty on the outside but conflicting when carefully analyzed, similar to the Victoria Project."
fresh,finds enough intriguing and compelling means of dramatizing and turning its domestic horrors inside out that it remains engaging right up until the final frames
rotten,"If only the movie were as fascinating as seeing the cast act a damn fool while promoting it. As a friend of mine said recently, let’s hope this press tour never ends."
fresh,"Despite its predictability, contrivances, derivative themes, a scattered and choppy third act, and bounty of partially realized ideas the film is undeniably watchable, even engrossing at times."
rotten,"Thematically it's all over the place, never quite figuring out how to synthesize its ideas in a coherent or satisfying way."
rotten,"After this promising start the film seems not to know quite where to go next. The ending is certainly a let-down, and perhaps the screenplay should have had another rewrite."
fresh,"Muddled in places, it nonetheless shows ambition and furthers Pugh’s reputation as one of the most watchable stars of the moment."
fresh,"Don't Worry Darling bursts the bubble of virtuality and forces us to ask ourselves the uncomfortable questions that we usually avoid, is it valid to build success on a fantasy that others assume to be real? [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,Our look at Olivia Wilde’s DON’T WORRY DARLING ... The film was surrounded by controversy long before its Venice premiere. In this review we are left trying to answer the question everyone is asking: was it worth all the drama?
fresh,Wilde knows how to cast just as well as she knows how to lay impeccably manicured and yet insidiously tense scenes.
rotten,"Where Don’t Worry Darling unfortunately fumbles is the screenplay by Katie Silberman ... Based on a story credit by two men responsible for Chernobyl Diaries and, yes, Titanic II, the story is an amalgamation of a whole host of influences."
fresh,"There's no question this is an open-and-shut case of Styles over substance, but Pugh's phenomenally ferocious femme grabs the story by the throat and does not let go."
rotten,"The sluggish and predictable plot fizzles, and the film leaves little lasting impression."
rotten,"The initial charm of the visuals doesn’t go anywhere and Wilde’s approach to it feels insubstantial, all superficial flourishes with little underneath that feels genuinely interrogative or revealing or thoughtful. Great gowns, though. Beautiful gowns."
rotten,"Despite Pugh’s amazing performance, the film’s inability to go deeper into the narrative’s dark core causes it to flounder amid its superficiality."
rotten,"Don’t worry darling, you can look it up when you get home."
rotten,"The script lacks grace and polish, one star’s questionable acting skills is amplified by the other lead’s performance, and Olivia Wilde‘s direction is noticeably weak."
rotten,"Despite its compelling premise and Florence Pugh's remarkable performance, the film loses steam as it delves into its mysteries and secrets. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"“Don't Worry Darling” is a huge disappointment—a film that wasn't without potential, but ultimately took the simplest possible routes. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"For better, or perhaps for worse, we’ll be talking about this thing for years to come."
fresh,It doesn't make a lot of sense but you have a lot of fun figuring out it makes no sense.
rotten,"Don’t Worry Darling is initially captivating because of all that it promised but when it devolves into little more than a few nods to stronger, more memorable predecessors, it becomes victim to its own ambitions and set-up."
rotten,A frustratingly empty sophomore effort.
rotten,"This is a film in which the real plot only turns up for the last half-hour or so. And by that time, I wasn't worried, darling. I was nearly asleep."
rotten,"The film clearly wants to make salient points about patriarchal control and toxic/fragile masculinity, but they're undercut by the blunt storytelling and nonsensical denouement."
fresh,"""Don't Worry Darling"" serves its purpose as a thrilling, mystery drama. It's not the best film of the year, but you can have fun with it."
fresh,"The film sets out to lure us into the retro fantasy so that we can share the shock of Alice’s awakening - which looks a lot like a mental breakdown, with Pugh acting in a much more realistic register than anyone else."
rotten,"Despite the title of Olivia Wilde’s controversial movie, it turns out there are plenty of things in it to be concerned about."
fresh,"There’s more here that needed to be developed, but there’s a certain momentum present that manages to keep Wilde’s splashy dish from being entirely undercooked."
rotten,"Don’t Worry Darling originally looked set to be one of the better films of the year but it is sunk by a messy screenplay, laboured narrative, and ultimately unsatisfying finale."
rotten,"A collection of tired tropes and befuddling questions, it largely skates by on some decent performances and a mood that (intentionally) curdles in a fashion that’s all too-familiar"
fresh,"As we plummet into the Big Reveal — Black Mirror fans might see it coming — things fall apart, logistically and conceptually, though in an undeniably spectacular way."
rotten,"Once the truth is all revealed, it all feels very meh, and you find yourself saying ohh ok – that’s a decision. The editing confused the watcher at times..."
rotten,Don't Worry Darling confirms Wilde's talent as a director but perhaps she needs to be more discerning about the scripts she takes on.
rotten,"What was meant to be a triumph on screen has instead become a mere mention in the footnotes of all this drama, and leaves viewers with a story that's as empty as the egg shells in Victory."
rotten,"It takes a while for Don’t Worry Darling to reveal itself as abysmal, because it spends such a grueling amount of time being merely pedestrian."
fresh,"A tense, intelligent skewering of MAGA fantasies that nevertheless struggles with its big reveals."
fresh,“Don’t Worry Darling” is a well-made motion picture with outstanding production values and a spectacular lead performance by Florence Pugh at its core. It also proves that filmmaker Olivia Wilde can direct an action sequence with the best of them.
fresh,"Sans a few explosive sequences, this plays like a pretty straight-forward old-school, psychological thriller that is more interested in finding a way out of the mystery than establishing a more pertinent theme out of the premise it creates"
fresh,"One hoped it was either a hot mess or a cinematic masterpiece to fit with the online narrative. Unfortunately, it's a film that makes you second-guess yourself on whether it's good or bad, instead taking the boring middle way of being just fine."
rotten,Too glib to be convincing.
fresh,"If you are fascinated by stories on controlled chaos and experimental societies, you’ll enjoy this thriller."
rotten,"Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling is a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes celebrity scandal, helping to keep an otherwise forgettable film in the public’s consciousness."
rotten,It’s all very alluring and sexy and intriguing right up until the point when it reveals that it has nothing to say.
fresh,Ambitious if overwrought and undercooked.
rotten,I felt as if I'd been invited to a dinner at which the host had set a great table but didn't follow through with a satisfying main course.
fresh,An engaging and unsettling keep-you-guessing drama — at least until its rushed climax.
rotten,There’s just no hiding the massive chasm between how smart Don’t Worry Darling thinks it is and how smart it actually is.
rotten,"Plot holes and unanswered questions will nag at you once Don’t Worry Darling ends. And yet, this is a film that will dissipate from your consciousness the moment you leave the theatre, a vision as flimsy and hollow as any sold by the Victory project."
rotten,"Looks amazing, and probably had a good script at some point in development. But a lot of bad, bad choices were clearly made here."
rotten,"The film might well have a raft of “important” things to say about gender roles, sexual politics, the dreaded patriarchy and so forth, yet it's simply a languid dirge that becomes dull, a try-hard film that doesn’t ring the bell it’s clearly reaching for."
rotten,"...lingers far too long in the Victory Project. In an alternate reality, there’s a brilliant, 95-minute, reimagined, and restructured version of Don’t Worry Darling – one that leaves you with the right kind of questions."
fresh,"An entertaining thriller replete with well-built tension, mostly elegant acting performances (except for Harry Styles’s), and a richly designed world."
fresh,"It’s not easy playing most of a film in a state of paranoid terror, and somehow Pugh keeps it from becoming monotonous... This film is one more piece of evidence of this young British actress’ formidable powers."
fresh,"It is an uneven, but visually compelling, film whose emotional resonance rests on the square shoulders of Pugh, her generation’s answer Kate Winslet."
rotten,"If the film had been amazing, it still would have been fascinating, but because Don’t Worry Darling is such an out-and-out failure, it is even more so -- all of this chaos for so few returns."
rotten,"Ultimately, Don’t Worry Darling is best described as style over substance filmmaking. The movie wastes a really interesting world to set up a poorly executed twist. It is desperate to be incredibly smart and edgy but loses a step in sloppy execution."
rotten,"Metaphors abound, acting as currency for audiences to hypothetically cash out for the twist they know is coming, but the frequent use of repetitive shots ... simply eats up the film's runtime and frustrates viewers wanting to get to the point already."
rotten,"A mash-up of The Stepford Wives, The Truman Show, and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it's a fairly vacuous (though quite stylish) peculiar cinematic hodge-podge that feels as if director Olivia Wilde was channeling director M. Night Shyamalan."
rotten,"Led by Florence Pugh's redoubtable performance, this glossy thriller draws unfavorable comparisons to a whole swath of different bygone films, cribbing their unsettling undertones without adding much new to the mixture."
rotten,"Has an extraordinarily hard time keeping any of its many ideas straight, or developing any of them to any real degree."
rotten,"True, it’s a fabulous looking film but an annoyingly hollow one, and not everyone comes out of it with their dignity intact."
fresh,"Hallucinatory, sensual and delectably disturbing."
fresh,"Starts really strong, really surreal... but it kind of peters out by the time you get to the end."
fresh,"Actor-director Olivia Wilde keeps things intriguing, while deploying properly dazzling imagery. And Florence Pugh delivers such a belting central performance that everyone around her pales by comparison."
rotten,"Wilde’s film is undeniably interesting but inescapably flawed, conjuring some arresting imagery but landing at a “that’s your lot” finish with a great big indifferent thud."
fresh,"What is the perfect life, and what would you sacrifice for it? When asked that, teens might have an instant reaction that's wrapped up in identity, independence, and a modern perspective."
rotten,Don’t Worry Darling is a shoppers’ paradise for filmgoers indifferent to current crises and clueless about bygone social standards.
rotten,"It is just possible that there is a snappier, less derivative little thriller somewhere inside Wilde’s movie. Like the inhabitants of the Victory project, however, it is in dire need of liberation from its gilded, airless prison."
fresh,I enjoyed my time with the movie — which is sumptuously shot and well acted — and would watch it again to see how my knowledge of the outcome would shape my appreciation of it.
fresh,"Much like the Victory Project in the story, Venice winner Don't Worry Darling is captivating to watch on the surface with its visually hypnotic cinematography, but delve deeper for answers, and most are absent."
rotten,"It’s a dazzling enough affair while it lasts, but it’s mostly forgettable."
rotten,There are worse ways to spend one’s time than enjoying another solid performance from Pugh. There are also better ways to spend one’s time than with Don’t Worry Darling.
fresh,"It contains enough that’s good—especially, it can’t be said enough, Pugh’s performance—to make it worth a look even with the foreknowledge that it’s not going to stick the landing."
rotten,Wilde manages to heighten the mystery in spite of the outcome being so simplistic and implausible. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"There's so many plot holes, inconsistencies, unanswered questions, and just straight up nonsense."
rotten,Darling settles for morality police-proofing one of speculative fiction’s oldest yarns.
fresh,A macabre fable about the conservative pulses that currently pervade America. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,... A shattering blow to contemporary idealization. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Don't Worry Darling gets by (just barely) on the shoulders of Florence Pugh.
rotten,"Wilde’s film aims to be a feminist parable about how this idealized vision of the past is actually a curdled vision of coupledom. Abstractly, that’s a robust concept; in execution, the movie’s absurdity overpowers its message."
rotten,"It’s a drag being so far ahead of the characters the entire time, and Wilde’s maddeningly repetitive structure makes the viewer feel as trapped as the protagonist."
fresh,"People are getting caught up in some very silly gossip about the film. My response is, “Don’t Worry Darling.” See it for yourself."
rotten,“Sophomore slump” fails to encompass the badness of Don’t Worry Darling. “Sophomore cratering” or perhaps “sophomore pratfall” get closer to the mark.
rotten,"We're at least left with Florence Pugh's performance, but the rest is somewhat flavorless on most occasions and pretty ridiculous in its final stretch. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Don’t Worry Darling would have crushed if it had come out in the 1970s.
rotten,"The rhythm and protagonist's stakes may camouflage the empty discourses, but the film's one unforgivable fault is its blatant feminist empowerment message and critique against the patriarchy that is ultimately fragile and bland. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"A compelling terror tale that retains the flavor of Bram Stoker but adopts the pattern of Alien (the tagline might as well have been “At sea, no one can hear you scream”)."
rotten,"Despite the nature of its monster, the film lacks any real bite and feels very predictable and lacking in atmosphere or movement."
rotten,The concessive events that are narrated... do not successfully spark interest sufficient to maintain afloat this two-hour film that is also not very entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"A gothic claustrophobic horror tale that presents us with an animalistic and genuinely scary Dracula, who is brought to aggressive life by Javier Botet."
fresh,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is pretty in that gritty style that says everyone needs a bath and no one should share a comb. With 95% of the film taking place on the Demeter, the ship feels both vast and claustrophobic."
rotten,"You have a pretty good sense of what’s going to happen. ... If you have a boat with a “Vampire on Board” bumper sticker, there’s a good chance that one crew member after another is getting slaughtered, and it’s just a matter of watching it happen."
fresh,"The movie knows exactly what it is ... It doesn’t take itself seriously, but it’s also never winking at us, which is a fine line to walk."
fresh,"Director André Øvredal knows how to deliver jump-scare horror. … Here, though, he throttles back on the in-your-face horror, opting instead to build up tension and let it snap in measured doses."
fresh,"Did we really need this Dracula footnote to set sail at all? Perhaps not, but while Øvredal’s expansion on the world isn’t as fun as the grim fables from which it draws blood, it still has some bite."
fresh,"It’s just such a well executed, relentlessly grim, and creepy horror entry with a Dracula we’ve never actually seen before."
rotten,Nosfera-too bad this movie is boring and terrible!
rotten,"There is a lack of ideas, both in terms of staging and content, in order to keep the audience happy.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Either the undercooked screenplay needed to marinate for another decade or two or, more likely than not, the promise inherent in the premise was never meant for anything more than what it always was, a chapter in Stoker’s novel."
rotten,"Consistently creepy yet rarely terrifying, this flat spinoff doesn’t make any meaningful additions to the mythology of the source material."
rotten,There’s a brief novelty to the bloody spectacle that Øvredal’s latest provides but this supposed final voyage feels considerably thin by its end
rotten,I'm not quite sure how you make a vampire slasher on a boat boring and yet here we are.
fresh,"It manages to develop a tense and slightly bloody story, where all sexuality has been removed from Dracula in order to portray him as a true monster. It could have been better, but it's not like I regret seeing it at the cinema. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"While not the best vampire film, its phenomenal visuals, cast, and tense moments make The Last Voyage of the Demeter worth watching."
fresh,"Though there is much to decry about the film, there’s enough present here to make the price of a ticket worth your while. Just get ready to queue up some quiet music when you leave the theater."
rotten,"Dracula may fare well at sea, but his film mostly sinks under its weight of cliche-strewn course."
fresh,"After many, many Dracula/vampire movies, a good, simple idea like this one works surprisingly well, thanks to the fixed, moody setting, intricate sound design, and an eerie, malevolent monster."
fresh,"I do wonder what Øvredal would have made of a Norse monster rather than one born of a British imagination. For what it is, it's good enough."
rotten,"Directed by such an expert in the genre like André Øvredal and gifted with a score composed by Thomas Newman, The Last Voyage of the Demeter sets up the fantasy but fails to bring the terror. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"After reading the brief plot description, you’ve practically seen the movie."
rotten,The enactment of life aboard a merchant ship and the disturbing atmosphere of this journey at the turn of the XIX century are amongst the best elements of this uneven adaptation. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"And as soon as the Demeter sets sail, it begins to submerge. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"In the end The Last Voyage of the Demeter doesn’t totally suck, but it lacks the bite it needs to separate it from the multitude of Dracula cinematic entries."
fresh,"The story is tragic, the vibes are excellent, and the ensemble sells every minute. It may feel subdued, but you’ll probably still leave with a satisfying chill."
rotten,Commendable atmosphere and creature design can’t save a horrendous screenplay.
rotten,"It’s a long wait between killings, and the killings are never very impressive or even distinct from each other."
rotten,"André Øvredal should be a great choice to bring tension and scares, but he's on autopilot and his great cast has nothing to do. Cobweb's Woody Norman fares best, in part because his character has the best sequence."
fresh,"It's old-school story telling - as it should be, considering its origin - that never pulls back from the gore."
rotten,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter will certainly not be the last time Dracula is resurrected for a movie, but this take on the old monster has all the lifeblood sucked out of it."
fresh,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a relentless, heartless film. This type of bleak movie won't resonate with most audiences. Corey Hawkins really get to show his range."
fresh,"Dark, ominous, chilling equals fun in viewing an above average vampire movie."
rotten,"This loose, bloated adaptation of “Log of the Demeter,” an excerpt from a chapter in Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” could’ve used more bite."
fresh,"Overall the film starts off on some rough waters, but once it gets down to Dracula going full terror on the sea versus a standout Corey Hawkins as the film’s hero, it’s riveting and heartbreaking."
fresh,"Beyond being an exciting, effective and well-made horror, this is not an extravagant movie... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"What’s really gear-grinding is the depiction of Dracula himself, which is just frustrating in all the ways you’d expect a movie trying to make use of and differentiate itself from a hundred-or-so years of vampire films would be."
rotten,"[The filmmakers] don't make the most of the claustrophobia of the ship, and at the same time, they don't give you the vast expanse of the seas, either."
rotten,It just feels very stale and bland.
fresh,"The writing, acting and production values are of an unexpected high quality reminiscent of the work of such old-school fright factories as Universal Studios in the 1930s-‘40s and Hammer Films of the 1960s."
fresh,...a compelling premise that’s employed to watchable yet increasingly erratic effect...
rotten,"The hey-great-idea feeling you might’ve entertained gets worn down quickly and thoroughly, and it’s hard not to come away with the sense that all the previous Draculas got it right by having most of the Demeter’s ordeal happen entirely off-screen."
rotten,The Last Voyage of the Demeter expands a chapter of Dracula into a modest fright-gathering rather than a full-on frightfest.
rotten,The Last Voyage of the Demeter doesn’t make enough of an impression to stand out amongst the veritable legions of other Dracula films that already exist.
rotten,The whole production seems lost at sea.
rotten,"To call The Last Voyage of the Demeter predictable is like calling Count Dracula a carnivore – absolutely self-evident, yet still underselling things just a bit."
rotten,"If more concise, the Stockholm syndrome, some death choices, and the sheer hopelessness of being at sea with a thing you can’t combat would have been more effective."
rotten,"Given that the director brought us one of the last truly scary movies, The Autopsy of Jane Doe,  you might think this one might have some chills and thrills - and it just doesn't. It drags on and on with no hint of spookiness until it's too late."
fresh,"As this well-made movie is essentially an effective exercise in mood management, we are made to wait until the real star of the show makes his unpleasant presence felt... Traditionalists, however, will dig the slow and scenic route navigated here."
fresh,"Although the movie does not reach its full potential, particularly with the paranoia aspect the premise offers, it remains a simple, effective nightmare. It’s bloody, exciting, and everything you would expect."
rotten,"A film that never rises to the level of isolation it needs to develop genuine dread, too often sidelining Cunningham and Dastmalchian and becoming little more than serving up one character attack on deck and searching of limited confines in the daylight."
rotten,The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a dull retread.
fresh,...it turns out to be a clever enough side story that feels like a good flashback sequence in a show where we know what happens next.
fresh,"What 'The Last Voyage of the Demeter' lacks in consistent thrills, it makes up in its serious and grizzly approach to a neutered sub-genre of horror."
fresh,There are too many other good Dracula films to watch other than this flawed one.
fresh,Atmospherics can carry a movie only so far and The Last Voyage of the Demeter sinks under the weight of its unrelieved gloom.
rotten,An interesting premise but also a challenging one... because we know what happens.
fresh,"It is, simply, just a movie about Dracula on a boat and that’s okay! That’s fun!"
fresh,The Last Voyage of the Demeter is an atmospheric brutal creature feature hindered only by its scriptwriting.
fresh,This movie is scary and the monster freaked me out. That is all.
fresh,"While it has some flaws, it remains a well constructed horror movie that honors its source material. I imagine Stoker would be pleased."
fresh,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter nails the atmosphere and overall feel of the time period, but the story just isn’t as interesting as the writers want it to be."
fresh,What’s perhaps most pleasurable about The Last Voyage of the Demeter  is that it is unironic vampire horror.
fresh,This bloody period horror film proves that vintage literary monsters are still downright frightening no matter your (or their) age.
fresh,“Demeter” is as gripping as it is gruesome. It’s a dread-drenched stop on the Dracula timeline that has enough to please the iconic villain’s long-time fans and plenty to win over new ones as well.
rotten,"It should’ve been an elaborately conceived thrill-kill horror, but it instead stays in one gear: day breaks, accusations are hurled, night falls, people die, repeat for nigh on two hours."
rotten,"'Alien' meets 'Master and Commander' is a hell of a hook for a horror film, which leaves one wondering how they managed to screw it up so badly."
fresh,[...] is The Last Voyage of the Demeter a shipwreck or a thrilling voyage? Let's call it a somewhat rocky journey that will leave some delighted and others reaching for the lifeboats.
rotten,"Despite its technical prowess and its effective visual aesthetics, this predictable voyage doesn't manage to generate any thrills. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A tepid tale of terror aboard the ill-fated cargo ship that carried Dracula from Eastern Europe to Whitby, England kind of sucks."
fresh,"The type of project that manages to lift itself up above the fray by sheer will and chops, not to mention its determination to scratch a throwback-genre itch."
fresh,"After decades of neutering, it’s fun to once again encounter a vampire who is bestial and monstrous."
fresh,"The makeup and practical effects are brilliantly executed, crafting gore and a creature that can fuel nightmares. While the pacing may be too slow in spots and this lacks a scary vibe, the acting and drama work to create a grimly dire film."
fresh,"A perfect combination of gore and terror, “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” is a trip you definitely want to take if you are a horror film fan."
fresh,"A terrific cast led by Corey Hawkins, chilling visuals, and a terrifying Dracula make this voyage worth taking."
fresh,"The film is a great deal of insidious fun, and I have a sneaky suspicion that my fondness for it will only grow as I return to it again and again over the coming years."
fresh,"It’s not the best Dracula film you’ll ever see, but it is a chilling new spin on the character, and a voyage horror fans will mostly be glad they took."
fresh,"A formulaic yet effective take on the horror icon, Dracula. The Last Voyage of the Demeter nails the atmosphere, the creature design and the crew of this ship. An easy watch with potential for more in the future!"
fresh,"No yo-ho-ho's here, though, or bottles of rum, either, as told from just one chapter of the late-19th century, Bram Stoker novel that introduced the ""Prince of Darkness"" and, eventually, bloodsucking as a spectator sport."
rotten,"As the charred and barren Demeter finally lands on English shores, it’s hard not to get the sense that this underbaked and overlong film, like most of its crew, is largely dead on arrival."
fresh,Spanish creature actor Javier Botet does an excellent job capturing Dracula’s unnatural movements and physique... accomplishing the complete opposite of Gary Oldman’s sensual fiend.
fresh,Keeps the dark Gothic vibe of Bram Stoker's original work and doesn't give into the temptation of becoming too Hollywood.
rotten,A great idea with few surprises and a muddled plot and murky cinematography.
fresh,"André Øvredal directs, and while his palette is dark and murky and it’s often hard to discern who’s doing what to whom, he makes some terrifying choices that leave you wrecked, defying tired horror movie tropes."
fresh,"A well-made, atmospheric chiller that nicely differentiates itself from other cinematic Dracula tales."
rotten,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter wants to be Alien on the high seas, but drifts into shark week."
fresh,"Staying true to the mysticism and the horror of the novel, director André Øvredal offers the audience a slow burn that is perhaps a little too slow."
fresh,"If you're a Dracula fan, you absolutely should watch it."
fresh,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a slow burn, claustrophobic atmosphere piece punctuated by occasional gouts of blood."
rotten,The Last Voyage of the Demeter showed promise early on but failed to capitalize on the inherent horrors of its story.
rotten,"'The Last Voyage of the Demeter' offers a few shudders and eye-catching creature effects, but sinks on its way to shore."
fresh,"Told through the Captain's own logs, the horror film paints a brutal and bloodthirsty portrait of Dracula that is to be feared. The Last Voyage of the Demeter hits you like a stake through the heart; it's gruesome, scary, and unrelenting."
fresh,"It builds an ever-increasing sense of dread with each new scene, but even more impressive is how shrewd it is, filling the screen with smart characters, sly twists, and a sense of morality."
rotten,Smooth sailing it isn't.
fresh,It’s all vigorously detailed and hair-raisingly enhanced with extraordinary computer-generated special effects.
fresh,Voyage of the Demeter doesn't have enough scares to qualify as a great horror movie – and it is far too daft to work as a drama. But it scores as a showcase of technique and skills that are happily in resurgence.
fresh,"Stylish, creepy and very gory takeoff on Bram Stoker's Dracula, fleshing out his trip across the ocean to England."
fresh,"What truly distinguishes Last Voyage of the Demeter, beyond its thick atmosphere of dread, is its gleeful cruelty, the delicious mean streak with which it sets up its suspense set pieces and its kills."
fresh,It’s B-movie pulp executed with just the right amount of Masterpiece Theatre classiness — a refined monster mash.
fresh,"For genre devotees who are jonesing for the distinctive pleasures of a lushly produced, 1800s-set supernatural thriller, Øvredal’s film will feel like a properly bloody steak dinner after a long, demoralizing fast."
rotten,"Predictable, gruesome, but unscary..."
rotten,"""A hackneyed, clunky script and dull, unappealing characters sink this experience shortly after it embarks. This Dracula has fangs, but they are softer than butter."""
fresh,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a rocky trip, with moments that shock, moments that underwhelm, and a movie that I respect more than I loved. This Voyage had just enough bite to keep me aboard."
fresh,"Still, the Dracula-on-a-boat movie mostly delivers on the promise inherent in its premise."
fresh,An often striking take on the tale that makes up for what it lacks in surprise with a lot of style and some undeniably effective scare moments.
fresh,"It was easy to follow and piqued my interest in something I haven’t seen from a Dracula story. For me, that’s a successful movie."
rotten,"Despite its shortcomings, the cast is earnest, serious and willing to perform their roles as if this was the first time they were ever played … despite what Ripley might say."
rotten,"An intriguing idea, well-crafted and atmospheric, though its script unfortunately pits our fanged nightmare against a crew stacked with dimwitted short-sightedness. It is that one important piece that keeps this floating vessel from ever truly sailing."
rotten,"One thing is for sure, THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DEMETER aka DRACULA BOAT is truly a horror as it showcases the behaviors of a terrible roommate. Dracula is a slob."
fresh,"There’s a lovely, sad sense of adventure, as the beautiful sunsets and swashbuckling setting is flipped into a house of horrors."
fresh,"Right from the start, Øvredal gives great atmosphere...[as] LAST VOYAGE becomes a claustrophobic survival saga akin to ALIEN or THE THING."
rotten,"The central idea of The Last Voyage of the Demeter is too good to simply write off the movie... That approach, though, is simply too formulaic to give the movie too much credit..."
fresh,"This is good, fun summer fare, shot in ominous shades of darkness by cinematographers Roman Osin and Tom Stern and fueled by an effective score by Bear McCreary that isn’t obtrusive."
rotten,"Dracula himself ... is reduced to a run-of-the-mill boogeyman, little more than a leathery, silent monster who pops out of the shadows every once in a while when no one’s bled onscreen for ten minutes."
rotten,"There was a time when Botet's slavering monster might have carried the picture by itself. But that was then, and this isn't."
rotten,… the key players in “Demeter” have very little agency. They cower and hide and die. It’s dismal instead of thrilling and annoying instead of scary.
rotten,The Last Voyage of the Demeter had the base elements to be terrifying. What we get is a painfully slow slog through tired genre tropes. The characters don't have an ounce of self-preservation or rationality.
fresh,This Alien-inspied take on Dracula may not take full advantage of its premise and intriguing character dynamics but is elevated by dread and a strong ensemble injecting enough emotion to offset a subpar script
fresh,"65 may not be as refined or ravishing as the other survival thrillers or sci-fi adventures, but if you’re tired of mush and masculinity, this may be a slightly different experience."
rotten,"Silly but too serious, kinda exciting and pretty familiar."
rotten,"Wasted potential with an excellent lead, dinosaur mayhem & nice sci-fi gadgets."
rotten,The limited cast of two major players and a script that allows for little flexibility leaves the production as just being bland.
rotten,"65 is as unimaginative and predictable as anticipated, only even less entertaining and far more bland. Adam Driver and Ariana Greenblatt try their best. A dinosaur flick this uninteresting should be considered a cinephilic crime."
rotten,"A no-frills, no-thrills dud."
rotten,"65 should only be recommended after one has run out of films to watch, which might not be for many years."
fresh,A passable sci-fi survival adventure pushes a thin premise to a mercifully short end.
rotten,"Driver is always very good no matter what role he takes on, whether it is a spaceship pilot battling dinosaurs or Darth Vader's grandson battling the force and the inner conflict that wages war inside him."
rotten,"The whole desperate dad thing gets wearisome as if the movie were conscientiously telling lonely 9-year-olds how much their absent work-junkie fathers actually love them. Which it is. Driver’s big salary-earning business trip isn’t happening “to you."""
fresh,"It’s maybe too slim and uninspired for its own good, but it’s quick enough to where you aren’t all that bothered by the time spent with it."
fresh,"Driver makes it all stick. It’s his first lead role in the action hero genre, and he adds depth and nuance to a thinly written role. We don’t know much about Mills, but the actor keeps us plugged in due to his ability to elevate material."
rotten,"Confusingly bland and riddled with plot holes, 65 doesn’t give its talented lead much to work with."
rotten,"Dreary, under-developed wannabe sci-fi action adventure that strives for suspense but plays like the kind of grade B-creature feature that used to be drive-in theater fare."
fresh,"With excellent, double-strength VFX and whole-hearted embrace of B-movie aesthetics, 65 is terrific entertainment with outstanding action cinematography giving the film a visual polish that sits several grades above what we typically see in Marvel films."
fresh,"Nothing really sinks its teeth in deep enough to draw blood, metaphorically speaking, of course."
rotten,The premise doesn't hold up to close scrutiny and the narrative can be jarringly slow-paced.
rotten,"""After Earth"" with little that would pass for humor and no swagger. The limited thrills and Driver's bland by-the-book approach make this play like the extremely-padded-with-filler ""Twilight Zone"" episode it was begging to be."
fresh,"It wasn't terrible... I really feel like Adam Driver and Ariana really brought some heart to the movie, that I cared about the characters."
fresh,The unexpected is always just around the corner.
rotten,An adventure that should be more like a roller coaster and less like an intimate story. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,What is this January dumping ground movie doing on screens in March?
rotten,Just an average sci-fi story with no chemistry between the two leads.
rotten,"... A fantastic premise that fails to take full advantage of its own approach and, although it wants to amuse us to the fullest, it remains an irresistible video store cover. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"65 isn't creative at maximizing its possibilities, but... it sustains its idea with the efficiency of a sci-fi paperback. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"""65"" is from the writers of ""A Quiet Place,"" but it lacks any of the creativity or emotion of that film. The film wastes all the potential world building in the setup, and instead delivers a bare bones ""get from point A to point B"" movie."
fresh,"The Adam Driver-starring thriller is a lean, mean exercise in sci-fi suspense set far in our planetary past (if only by sheer misadventure)."
rotten,"65 is a gruesome thing to watch, even for dinosaur lovers—and not much fun, either."
fresh,Driver gives a Driver-level performance and it’s a tight 90 minutes. And those two aspects alone are enough for a passable dino actioner.
rotten,'65 operates at a pace that both manages to slog down and speed past how interesting something like this could be.
fresh,"65 is essentially a big-budget version of a simple, made-for-streaming creature feature, nothing more and nothing less."
rotten,I amused myself by thinking of 65 reasons to walk out...
rotten,65 might be the first film ever based on a movie poster. Its unoriginality and witlessness follow the blatancy of most contemporary content.
rotten,"Adam Driver’s intensely focused, utterly unironic performance is the only saving grace of this movie of few ideas and little suspense, mystery, or excitement. There aren’t even that many dinosaurs."
fresh,"I like its simplicity and straightforwardness. I like its indifference to being something revolutionary or groundbreaking. And I like its taut 93-minute frame, which turns out to be all a movie like this needs."
rotten,"The revelation that accompanies the title card for Scott Beck and Bryan Woods’ 65 all but demands a hearty guffaw, except this is a film that knows little of humor."
rotten,"While 65 starring Adam Driver isn’t a good movie, it does paint a dystopian portrait of terrible health insurance across the universe that is, unfortunately for us Americans, all too believable."
rotten,It's like defending a tree sloth: unnecessary.
rotten,[An] elementary sci-fi adventure of survival. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,... The film feels like 65 million years long. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The action sequences are equally half-baked, leaving the dinos stripped of majesty, while a climax that echoes countless 90s disaster films is further proof that 65 has precious few ideas of its own."
fresh,"While there’s not enough outer space to call it an intergalactic odyssey and barely enough dino havoc, 65 has just the right amount of vigor to survive its relatively short runtime."
rotten,"Scott Beck and Bryan Wood have written a short script. Maybe because they were in a rush, the internet ran out or they ran out of ideas and decided to milk them. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,65 is too repetitive and its premise is too simple. You'll be good catching it at home.
rotten,"A terribly underwhelming, suspense-free sci-fi, but still watchable thanks to Adam Driver’s commanding presence."
rotten,"It wasn’t enough! Whatever they paid Adam Driver for holding this feeble movie together, it wasn’t enough."
rotten,"65 plays like a studio film that’s had a lot of post-production meddling, not least in the way it repeatedly feels the need to explain its easy-to-grasp premise."
fresh,"65 might not be the kind of high-concept meme movie worth screeching loudly about to your friends... but it is a decently solid time at the movies,"
rotten,"A boring slog of an action… drama, sci-fi film."
rotten,A disappointing sci-fi film.
rotten,"65 is as disappointing and oddly misfiring as its title. Yeah, the dinosaurs are cool, but that's about it."
rotten,"Do you know why James Cameron never showed us Newt sobbing inconsolably over the dead bodies of her mom and dad? Because he’s an entertainer, not a sadistic moron."
fresh,"The version that treads forth is watchable, but also the most basic version of what it is, what viewers want and why it exists: yes, Adam Driver fighting dinosaurs."
fresh,"Adam Driver and his young co-star Ariana Greenblatt are fantastic, in this tight, to the point, survivalist, story, with a script trimmed of fat, excellent special effects and thunderous bang for buck show opposite some quieter moments of human heart."
rotten,"While this sci-fi/dinosaur movie is competently made, it really only has one good idea, and it doesn't do much with it. The rest is generic, familiar, and fails to generate much suspense or emotion."
rotten,"Entirely forgettable, partially nonsensical sci-fi fare."
fresh,"... A short, sharp, largely original major studio movie, unbound to any franchise or intellectual property — at a time when such a concept is being threatened with extinction. Also, it has a T-Rex in it. Sometimes, that’s enough."
fresh,65 delivers the guilty pleasure amusement one would expect from witnessing an endless onslaught of dinosaurs unleashed on the screen.
fresh,"While the first two-thirds of the film gets the job done, it’s the third act where “65” goes all out, and it sticks the landing perfectly."
rotten,"""Adam Driver fights dinosaurs"" is a neat idea for an exciting action/horror movie. 65's execution of that idea is decidedly poor."
rotten,It’s the serious tone and repetitiveness that unmoors a lot of what works about 65.
fresh,"Sometimes a short, simple premise with good leads is all you need. 65 is no Jurassic Park but it will entertain and get out before you want it to."
rotten,65 wastes a great concept on a bare-bones script that takes 65 Million Years to get interesting. Adam Driver does everything he can to hold the movie together but the story is dull and the action is too scarce to hold your interest even for 90 minutes.
rotten,"65 is at its best when it’s a survival story of a man trying to save the life of the little girl who effortlessly melts his stern exterior. Largely, the film is a reminder that I need to start watching The Last of Us."
rotten,"An unoriginal ""original"" film that Driver feels miscast in. Also if you're going to rip off Spielberg's Jurassic Park (or ""pay homage"") please at least take a page out of his other suspense playbooks and learn from Jaws on handling creature based tension."
rotten,"There are movies made where you are told to “switch your brain off and enjoy” in order to overlook the avalanche of flaws within them, but some films are just not good. 65 sits comfortably in the latter category."
fresh,"Terrific GGI monsters, swampy scares and Driver’s committed performance make 65 a snap-toothed popcorn multiplex movie which, at 93 minutes, is sprightly in comparison with its lumbering rivals."
rotten,The film’s in such a hurry to get to the next “thrilling” moment or to “up the stakes” (it introduces a ticking clock element around the halfway point... that it hurtles past any of the theoretical grandeur of the premise.
fresh,"By keeping its goals limited, it’s able to deliver what it promises, and that stands for something. I’ll admit I was more entertained by this high-concept sci-fi adventure than half the films I have seen thus far in 2023."
rotten,"A repetitive, frequently dull story that will have you counting down the minutes until it goes extinct."
fresh,"It's a raptor-ously wrought genre defier that's part actioner, part science fiction tale, part thriller, and all fun."
rotten,I'm always going to be here for you if something is wrong
rotten,It’s not schlocky enough to be so-bad-it’s-good and nowhere near good enough to be taken even a tiny bit seriously.
rotten,"There’s a reason such films have, in theatrical terms, been pushed to the brink of extinction, and 65 represents such an uninspired effort as to look like a fossil even before the credits roll."
fresh,Adam Driver's performance saves a great deal of this sci-fi film. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, shot this mid-budget action-thriller mid-Covid, cleaving to that kind of B-movie template, and aiming, but failing, to match those emotional stakes."
rotten,"65 is pegged as an ultimate survival saga from eons ago, but surviving this underwhelming thriller felt like a million years, literally."
fresh,65 knows what it is about and has fun with it.
fresh,"65 is an action-packed ride that doesn’t attempt to be more than it is: a smart, taut prehistoric thriller. The sci-fi is not overplayed, and it doesn’t require its audience to think beyond the surface level, which is the hallmark of good sci-fi."
rotten,"This loony, murky and muddled sci-fi action semi-thriller takes a detour through B-Movie Lane in a film that isn’t compelling enough to make for silly popcorn entertainment but isn’t terrible enough to be labeled a disaster,"
rotten,"Even at a crisp 93 minutes, there are only so many times you can watch Mills and Koa escaping yet another hungry soul that is understandably annoyed by the intruders."
fresh,It’s better than the last couple of Jurassic World sequels.
fresh,"Sure, there is the element of contrivance having Miller and Koa be compatible with our air and water, and to arrive just as the Chicxulub asteroid arrives to end the Cretaceous Era. Never mind. We get a great pot-boiler of an adventure."
fresh,"Adam Driver makes it work.  Also if you look at it as a 90 minute Twilight Zone episode.  I'm not saying it's a great movie, but it's not a bad movie either.  Will make a great digital rental or stream down the line."
rotten,"Driver treats the material like it’s Shakespeare, when the very concept calls for something a little more sincerely goofy. It’s like watching After Earth, in reverse."
rotten,"The problems with the effects reflect the problems with the film at large, in which the clashing tones manifest a wannabe goofy, gnarly genre picture that won’t put in any of the work to make it so."
fresh,"It's short, it gets up and boogies, and Adam Driver is always great."
fresh,"With economy of time blessedly in mind, its big action set pieces do triple duty, keeping the unrelenting action moving, the dramatic tension building and the pair of protagonists’ stakes at the forefront."
rotten,"It leans more toward “disappointing” than “awful,” but at least “awful” would have made it more interesting."
rotten,"... this film focuses on a handful of actors and features almost no dialogue, using little music or audio to goose the audience for big jumpscares. That is about all 65 has to offer, which makes it a disappointment to genre fans hoping for more."
rotten,"There’s nothing to these characters, and the action sequences quickly grow repetitive and wearisome."
rotten,"Aside from the surface curiosity and a few harrowing creature confrontations, this muddled science-fiction adventure struggles to heighten the emotional stakes."
fresh,"Is 65 good? Debatable. Is 65 enjoyable? Absolutely. The middle-budget film has disappeared, but 65 is an ambitious, entertaining example of why it should be returned."
rotten,Either the best or worst thing you can say about it is that it's a stinker so generic that you'll barely even remember the odor after it passes.
rotten,"There’s an appetite to discover the next great dinosaur movie that doesn’t have to do with “Jurassic Park,” Unfortunately, “65” doesn’t quite fill that desire."
rotten,[It's] lacking the one thing that really matters for material like this: some degree of imagination beyond the premise.
rotten,"The problem here isn’t that 65 is terrible—ironically, it would be easier to dismiss something incompetent, a movie focused on an actor less inherently interesting than Adam Driver—just that it’s kind of boring."
rotten,"Though there are movies that are worse than 65, it is part of a select few that manage to utterly and completely squander their own potential."
fresh,Is 65 ridiculous? Absolutely. Is it trope-y and occasionally too self-serious for its own good? Also yes. But did I still have the time of my life? You're darn right I did.
rotten,Think “Gilligan’s Island.” Not because it’s like “65.” Just because it’s more entertaining than “65.”
fresh,65 has enough to keep action and/or horror lovers at least mildly entertained.
rotten,"You might think you couldn't go wrong with dinosaurs and sci-fi, but 65 proves that you absolutely can."
rotten,"Despite a simplistic premise and a lean 90-minute runtime, that logline describing the film is basically all it’s got."
fresh,"If audiences give 65 a chance, and not overload it with expectations, I think they may find themselves pleasantly surprised. I know I did."
fresh,"If the lack of significant character interaction means that 65 becomes largely a strung-together collection of setpieces, they’ve been staged and put together by Beck and Woods to elicit some solid jumps and thrills."
rotten,Woods and Beck weirdly leash the natural momentum of the survival film to make sure viewers feel the expedition deep down in their hearts instead of at the edge of their seats.
rotten,"A lazy, vapid and tedious sci-fi thriller that's low on excitement, suspense, intrigue and, above all, entertainment. Adam Driver is wasted."
fresh,"This premise is only slightly less outrageous than Cocaine Bear, though it doesn't have the true story to back it up. Nevertheless, 65 absolutely delivers on prehistoric survival plus space weapons."
rotten,"65 million years from now, people will look back and wonder how a 90-minute movie with Adam Driver and dinosaurs never achieved lift-off."
rotten,"""65"" is set millions of years in the prehistoric past—and its ideas are only slightly younger."
rotten,"Anchored by another in a series of committed performances from Adam Driver and an ensemble of suitably menacing prehistoric beasts, Beck and Woods’ adventure delivers requisite thrills even if its creativity seems stuck in the distant cinematic past."
rotten,Not cheesy enough to be fun/bad nor awesome enough to compete with the “Jurassic” movies of the world...
rotten,A middling throwback creature feature.
rotten,"Like Mills’s emotional back story, the special effects seem to have been pulled out of a box of secondhand ideas. Nor is the execution all that impressive. There’s little in the way of awe, suspense or surprise."
fresh,It's decent entertainment but a tad familiar. Only distinguished by Driver's performance.
rotten,"If the sci-fi adventure 65 is to be believed, prehistoric Earth is a cheap-looking survival game where Adam Driver has to run from and shoot rubbery marauding dinosaurs."
rotten,"The sci-fi movie 65 might have had a major studio budget, but it’s a minor and embarrassing footnote in Adam Driver’s career. It’s a hodgepodge of ripoffs of much better films, such as Jurassic Park, A Quiet Place, and The Man Who Fell to Earth."
rotten,65 is a mostly diabolically bad film.
fresh,"It wastes a lot of potential but ultimately is more entertaining than not entertaining. If you are expecting Adam Driver fighting dinosaurs, it delivers. And you can't fault it for that."
rotten,"It’s not quite the toxic disaster it’s being treated as but 65 is nowhere near the giddy lark it should have been, crash-landing somewhere in the middle instead."
rotten,More heartbreaking than funny...
fresh,"It’s fun, vulgar and represents one of those films meant to be enjoyed on multiple occasions late at night with beers and friends. There exist other things in life that are worse for you."
rotten,"While Strays is categorized as a comedy, writer Dan Perrault (American Vandal) relies primarily on sex and toilet humor to bring on the laughs."
rotten,"Visually, director Josh Greenbaun doesn't offer anything surprising.  [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,The idea behind the movie is as stimulating as it is absurd. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"If you like dog-poop gags, you are in for a treat. ... If dog poop makes you gag, you might want to pass on this one."
rotten,"I might have liked it more if I saw it when I was thirteen - although many of the movies I saw back then STILL make me laugh - but today, I can't fully recommend it. It's different, yes, but unfortunately, it disappointed me. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"The weird thing about “Strays” is that the few really good jokes aren’t reliant on poop or penises or profanity, but good solid dog humor. … Those jokes are themselves strays, lost and in need of a good home."
fresh,"Sometimes you get blindsided by a slab of puerile, asinine comedy and you have no choice but to submit to it as your better judgment and notions of good taste expeditiously swirl straight down the crapper."
rotten,It less resembles a comedy movie than one 12-year-old blurting out “penis!” and 15 other kids giggling.
rotten,"Strays tries too hard to be edgy without nailing enough actual jokes…Josh Greenbaum’s film aims at something scattershot and scatological, but ends up feeling like something of a dog’s dinner..."
fresh,"It's uneven and should be sharper than it is, but is the dog movie equivalent of Bad Santa. Very scatological and obscene, but very funny."
rotten,"For audiences who want to just guffaw over bawdy humour coming out of the mouths of cute pups, Strays will be a winner and will probably have them howling. For anyone who wants a scintilla of humour that isn’t juvenile, they’d best move on."
fresh,"While cinematic canines have wagged across the silver screen since Rin Tin Tin’s heyday, Strays stands out by recognizing that any “man’s best friend” sentiment does neither side any favors."
rotten,"An average, predictable script is rescued from being truly irredeemable by an excellent cast of voice actors and a few bright jokes."
rotten,"Greenbaum and Perrault work the R-rated premise to the breaking point and more often than not, beyond, delivering a steady diet of anatomical and excremental humour with almost admirable regularity."
fresh,"Greenbaum delivers a tape with abundant doses of incorrectness, but correct in formal terms. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Takes a promising idea for an adult-centered comedy and blows it by shooting for the lowest bar possible.
rotten,"Testing the limits of canine cuteness, this raunchy revenge comedy might deserve credit for audacity, but even the least discerning moviegoers will realize quickly it’s more bark than bite."
fresh,"But that may be exactly why Strays is so funny: It converts the kid-friendly genre of dog movies into raunch, which shocks viewers into laughing -- kind of like South Park and Sausage Party did."
fresh,"There isn't much more to the proceedings than pooches behaving poorly. Whether or not that's enough depends on your tolerance for crude entendres, doggy-style."
rotten,"The novelty of hearing a dog say the f-word for the umpteenth time by the twenty-minute mark wears off quickly. That climax is cathartic enough to warrant a rental, however."
rotten,"Once all those dog jokes are exhausted, it falls back on the characters slinging as much profanity as possible as a substitute for a compelling story."
fresh,"It is goofy, silly, and filthy."
rotten,"While the cast are clearly having fun (Forte makes for a hideous nemesis), the central joke -- cute doggies cursing -- quickly wears thin."
fresh,There is funny stuff in the movie.. just didn't think it was funny enough.
fresh,Strays is refreshing in how it hits the high notes of sentimentality while also... [speaking] to a greater truth about the animal as something more than merely just an object of affection or as a compliment to human life.
rotten,"Granted, everyone reads comedy differently, but I just couldn’t muster up many chuckles for a film I could have seen myself enjoying more if it was handled better."
fresh,"With a stellar cast of comedic talent and plot twists few will see coming, this film is a real mutts-see for lovers of rude comedy."
fresh,"The film may target the juvenile funny bone of dog lovers, but it works in spades on that level without ever neutering its own profane sense of humor. Never say that critics can't enjoy a film paved with poop, pee and humping."
fresh,"Strays pawed its way into my heart, and I’m not even that much of a dog lover."
fresh,"At a certain point I realised it was funny, and rather touching, and that I was having fun. In other words, I was pleasantly surprised. Or, given its frequent scatological content, pleasantly surprised, unpleasantly."
rotten,Josh Greenbaum’s film is as bouncy and eager to please as a dog playing fetch. But only a few of the jokes it lays before us are properly funny.
fresh,"An at times heartfelt and enjoyably observed story that may hold interest with more patient viewers but, due to some episodic scene work and slack pacing, leave others restless."
rotten,Some clever ways exist in how Strays mocks other dog films like Marley & Me and animal-adjacent rom-coms – even as it veers into the predictability it’s critiquing in its own manner.
fresh,Strays is a quiet summer hit — just leave the kids at home for this one.
fresh,"Strays is an entertaining romp that may not have much more to offer than its elicit premise, but makes the most of its starry cast."
rotten,...a rather misbegotten endeavor that could only have worked as a five minute SNL sketch.
rotten,"Strays is a one-note gimmick than gets stretched to 90 minutes. These are ""jokes"" that would be a side chuckle in any other movie, but they're the main star here."
fresh,"Yes, STRAYS is laugh-out-loud funny, but it is also laced with a good amount of pathos. In the end, it’s a buddy movie starring dogs --- and it’s much better than expected."
fresh,STRAYS lives up to its rating and is reasonably absorbing because we quickly come to care about these animals.
fresh,"While the jokes occasionally miss the mark, Strays commits to its schtick and brings together an excellent comedic cast. The ridiculousness doesn’t always overcome the predictable story, but certain gags are creative."
fresh,While Strays may not be a film for everyone if you love stoner humour and being made laugh at things you shouldn’t then it is certainly worth a look. Strays will surprise you with some of the important messages it portrays to its audience.
rotten,"Everything that dogs do -- and doo-doo -- earns plenty of screen time, too, before a crescendo sequence, accompanied by Miley Cyrus' ""Wrecking Ball,"" seriously hits the fan."
rotten,"To sum up a review with a “dog’s dinner” line would be unconscionably lazy in normal circumstances, but since these pups routinely snack on vomit and faeces, it seems rather apt in this case."
fresh,“Strays” is wildly inappropriate. It’s also wildly funny.
fresh,"Strays is as raunchy as Ted or anything Seth Rogen ever thought of, but fortunately it also has a huge heart, and in the end that is why it works as well as it does."
fresh,"Halfway through my screening, I glanced at my notes and realized that I’d drawn a series of smiley faces."
rotten,"With a boring script, slightly entertaining performances and not enough storytelling to carry its short runtime, Strays fails to entertain with the story of a dog voiced by Will Ferrell looking for revenge."
fresh,"The appeal lies largely in the recognition that comes from seeing, unfettered by clean-up concerns, what disgusting thing it’s going to unearth next."
rotten,"While it is very funny in places, animal lovers may be uncomfortable with the amount of abuse that the dogs go through at the hands of the humans [Will Forte] -  and it may also be too raunchy for some, but smooshing your snout in it is kind of the point."
fresh,"Strays might be best enjoyed as a surface-level romp that lets these genuinely sweet dogs run wild, but falters when you try and take seriously its adult intentions."
rotten,"If watching talking canines constantly committing gnomosexual acts with inanimate yard statuary floats your boat, this might be your dream cruise. Otherwise, it could just give you a sinking sensation."
rotten,"Director Josh Greenbaum and writer Dan Perrault team up for neither of their best work with Strays, a lackluster crude dog comedy whose blessedly short run time is its most redeeming feature."
rotten,"If the film itself were a dog, it would be a homeless mutt, a dirty, smelly, unlovable street urchin ... it's simply a tedious, ruff watch."
rotten,It stalls when the humor stops and the violence starts.
fresh,"In terms of technical wizardry and patience, Strays took a clearly insane amount of work to make its woof-as-you-like comedy a big-screen reality."
fresh,"Strays is not amazing. But that’s not to say it won’t find its audience.... Because isn't there, somewhere out there, a cabal of big-hearted teenage dudes just waiting to give this disgustingly loveable/loveably disgusting comedy a forever-home?"
rotten,Past films like Dumb and Dumber showed that stupid comedy can be very entertaining. It just needs to be presented with at least a semblance of effort by the writer to show some respect for the audience.
fresh,"[Strays] understands the truth, which is: dogs, they're just better than humans."
fresh,"An aggressively raunchy, gleefully gross and only occasionally truly funny comedy."
fresh,"Funny at times, and the four-legged actors are adorable, but it suffers from jokes that could have been at least a little higher up the evolutionary ladder."
fresh,"Much of the comedy is crass yet hilarious, even though they repeatedly resort to toilet humour – literally using urine and feces as a punchline without it always being abhorrent."
rotten,"Strays was disappointing and predictable and could have easily been fixed if they moved on from overplayed jokes into something more meaningful. The film is meant to be crude, but that shouldn’t overpower the story."
fresh,It’s little more than an excuse to have dogs spew profanity and engage in raunchy hijinks. I didn’t remotely care because I was too busy laughing.
rotten,"Though it makes some attempts at finding genuine heart (and does at times succeed), Strays' contrasting tones makes for an awkward watch."
rotten,"Getting a Homeward Bound for adults wasn’t on my list of things I ever wanted, and while it’s fun at times, overall, it was ok. It’s probably really good to watch at home."
fresh,"In a cinematic world where the funniest comedies of the year are all rated R (No Hard Feelings, Joy Ride and, of course, 80 For Brady), feel free to add Strays to that prestigious list."
rotten,It’s oddly difficult to critique Strays because it’s not poorly made and it involves a lot of funny people. But it’s also not good.
fresh,"... a profane, sporadically funny perversion of homespun family adventures like Disney’s 1963 film “The Incredible Journey.”"
fresh,"That ""R"" rating means nothing is off-limits and – Foxx especially – can really take the leash off with the improvisations and delivery."
rotten,"As the script resorts to increasingly laboured gags about humping and poo, you suspect Strays may have worked better as a sketch."
rotten,"""What if dogs cursed a lot?"" is a funny idea, to be sure, but after seeing ""Strays,"" I'm not sure it was a good enough idea to merit an entire film."
fresh,"Josh Greenbaum’s comedy is built around a simple premise, which is that watching animals act and speak in profane ways is inherently hilarious. That premise is solid."
fresh,"Strays is Lady and the Tramp, except the tramp is a perverted little bulldog."
rotten,"When you have actors like Jamie Foxx and Will Ferrell in the same movie you would expect it to be a laugh riot, but sadly this one is not. I'm still amazed that you can bring these titans of comedy together and really get no significant laughs."
fresh,"This is not the best in show when it comes to dog movies, but it may be the most raucous. If you command your inhibitions to sit and stay, you're sure to get a treat."
rotten,"Dogs deserve a better movie than this lowbrow, unfunny adult comedy."
fresh,"Strays is a loquacious Homeward Bound, and the super sweet yet seriously sour antics of these pooches are filled with filthy, gut-busting, leg-humping hilarity."
rotten,"Any comedy about dogs has a high standard to meet, in that it ought to be at least as funny as your actual dog just sitting there doing dog things."
rotten,It’s probably not a good sign to walk out of a raunchy comedy like Strays and being more struck by the level of craft that went into making it than the resonance of any of the jokes.
fresh,"“Strays” is pretty much a one-joke movie, one last romp at the end of summer. But it finds enough ways into that joke within its perfectly pithy running time to remain zippy and enjoyable."
rotten,"Strays is a gross-out canine comedy that fails to produce any laughs, leaving it fit only for the doghouse."
fresh,"We laughed just enough throughout Strays to give it a tepid recommendation, even if a lot of our chuckling made us feel pretty childish."
rotten,"Strays is a throwback in all the worst ways: An entire film founded on gags rampant in the mid-2000s, fixated on how funny it is that dogs hump and pee on things."
fresh,"Perhaps it cannot sustain a feature-length film, but if you’re also the sort of person who realizes you’re not above puerile humor – and to be clear, none of us are – then it might be enough."
fresh,"Strays is a raunchy, R-rated blast"
fresh,"Profane, outrageous, slapstick and funny in that distinctly stoner-friendly way, Strays also conveys a powerful message about the importance of companion animal care. Nicely done."
fresh,"Strays is silly and simple, but no less successful because of the silliness or the simplicity."
rotten,"As a movie, it is not a good boy; it is a bad dog. But if I were currently 12, I might have reacted in a more positive way."
fresh,"The obscenity is over-egged, especially the dialogue, but Strays comes together with sight gags, heart and a seamless blend of canines and computer imagery."
rotten,The film’s greatest offense is its lack of humor.
rotten,[It's] a movie that quickly bleeds its one gag dry.
rotten,"None of it is particularly novel, and there are better antecedents to revisit rather than watching this. Time to call the SPCA."
rotten,"he course, foul-mouthed R-rated comedy Strays” is the evil twin of “The Incredible Journey.”"
rotten,"Strays plays like a movie thought up in a stoner’s house, watching Pixar movies and telling his buddies, “You know what would be funny? If the dog from Up said F*** a lot.”"
rotten,"Moments of inspired digressions and non-sequiturs are so sporadic they almost feel as if they’ve been airdropped in from a better, weirder film... [and] the screenplay is a pie made up entirely of low-hanging fruit."
fresh,"When it comes to movies about talking animals, I’m not in the target audience. With only a few exceptions, I hate them. This one, however, is made for someone like me in mind."
fresh,"“Strays” balances human expectations and lost-in-translation animal experiences for a smart, suitably raunchy adventure that should resonate even if you don’t have a furry friend waiting at home for you afterward."
fresh,"The purpose of Strays is to disrupt the image that people have of movies where cute animals talk. It's the Jackass of talking animal movies: crude, comedic camaraderie. If you can't tolerate a lot of jokes about bodily functions, then avoid this film."
fresh,"Dogs really are totally gross in so many ways, and yet we, like this film, love them anyway."
fresh,"You could probably make the case that “Strays” is easily the most gag-inducing dog film of its kind, complete with visual stints about gentiles, bodily fluids, and one memorable needle drop involving “Wrecking Ball.”"
rotten,"The canines drop as many F-bombs as Pacino did in “Scarface.” Then there are the scatological jokes, each one more outlandish than the last, none bearing the slightest tinge of wit or joy."
fresh,"Breezy but occasionally bizarre, unhinged while still being cheeky and fun. And when it’s done, if you have a dog, you’ll probably want to give them a big ‘ol hug."
rotten,There are a few golden (buttery) scraps strewn around like discarded pizza crusts. You'll just have to paw through some garbage to find them.
fresh,"The crude Strays is a clever crowdpleaser that follows this simple story to its logical, grossly, and riotously hilarious conclusion"
rotten,"It's sort of amazing, amid an ultra-sanitized theatrical landscape, to see dialogue like that make it from page to screen. But it soon wears thin."
rotten,"Mostly, it's neither here nor there."
rotten,[Strays] spins its wheels through an interminable series of penis jokes that left many at the advance screening covertly checking their watches.
rotten,"Viewers that have little or no tolerance for alternating sex and bodily excretions gags will not want to adopt this dog, even if it does know a few tricks."
rotten,"A painfully unfunny, repetitive, uninspired and witless misfire. Strays makes Cocaine Bear look like a masterpiece."
fresh,Strays turns the bromide of man’s best friend on its ear.
rotten,"But outside of some solid observational dog humor, your enjoyment of “Strays” entirely depends on how funny you find pooches saying and doing outrageous things."
rotten,Is zooming into a Great Dane’s penis really that funny?
rotten,The most irritating film of 2023.
fresh,Foul-mouthed dogs on a mission are as fun as you'd imagine.
rotten,"If you removed every f-word and reference to the various properties and functions of genitals it would be ten minutes long, and most of the remainder would be the  dogs' mushroom-inspired hallucinations resulting in the fatal mauling of a bunny."
fresh,"Strays will have audiences rolling in the aisles with its unabashed embrace of raunchy humor. The naughty script cleverly tackles themes of animal abuse, cruelty, and neglect."
fresh,"Perhaps two gags out of 10 win a treat, but when they do — as in a bizarre digression involving a labrador’s internal monologue — the audacity can be jaw-dropping."
fresh,"It is a safe bet to call Strays the most adorable, yet rudest movie of the year. Reggie and his pals are a cute canine quartet but the film’s “beyond the chain” jokes and situations, mostly involving poop, vomit and doggie sex, are anything but sweet."
rotten,"I don't know that the writers - Tennant shares credit with Rick Parkes and Bekah Brunstetter - intend to break as many hearts as they might when real-life viewers don't get, as one character does, the pony they wish for."
rotten,"If I wish it hard enough, can this pseudo-Christian self-help melodrama become better?"
fresh,"While 'The Secret' doesn't tell you what you don't know already, it does so with simplicity and sensitivity. Overall, it's a well-meaning film that gives you cosmic hope"
rotten,"Maudlin to a fault, this shamelessly manipulative movie awkwardly puts forth its life-affirming platitudes with the subtlety of a sledgehammer."
rotten,"As a movie designed to deliver a message, the job gets done efficiently enough here. However, as a three-act drama with a simple story to tell, the whole thing is flat and uninspired as can be."
rotten,"Too bad it doesn't mention how much it helps to be white, have money, look great, or live in the first world. Those things. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"... Dare to Dream is less of a strict adaptation and more of an interpretative one, weaving the principles of The Secret within a romantic drama buttress as a means of empowering the audience to look at life a little differently."
rotten,Holmes was a good choice to portray Miranda because she offered a softness to the character while hiding an inner strength that Miranda needed.
rotten,There are too many annoying conventions that will drive viewers away. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,[A]ll the insidious messaging ruins even its limited appeal as a goofy romantic fantasy.
rotten,"The Secret may preach to dare to dream, but it fails to dare to be anything more than another failed attempt at translating self-help to the big screen."
rotten,Even beloved actors can't save this shallow attempt at inspiration.
rotten,"Despite the book getting an Oprah recommendation, it's no secret the book stinks and the film is even more of a stinker."
rotten,"Aside from the fact that the tree that falls into the house looks real, nothing about The Secret can overcome the fact that the movie aims to spark a romance that's as tepid as nearly everything else that precedes it."
rotten,"Everything I visualized about this movie - that it would be thinly written, barely acted, and painfully hokey - came 100 percent true."
fresh,"With strong performances from the leads and emotionally affecting material, I find myself overlooking or at least forgiving the flick's issues. (Full Content Review for Parents - Profanity, Injury images, etc. - also Available)"
fresh,"Even with my suspicions about how the laws of attraction could make a difference, I still had a decent couple of hours that kept me from discovering the latest doomsday predictions on social media. I'd call that a win."
rotten,"For the sheer inanity, bordering on toxicity, at its heart, The Secret: Dare to Dream is only ever going to be remembered as, maybe, the film this bloody awful year deserves."
fresh,"Just what we need right now - an entertaining rom com that is uplifting in every way. Try it, you'll like it."
fresh,"A movie doesn't have to be Oscar-worthy to be enjoyable ... The Secret: Dare to Dream sticks to a certain formula that people can expect, especially in how the story ends, but the movie's positive message makes it an uplifting ride along the way."
rotten,"""The Secret: Dare to Dream"" wants to remind us of those bland, coastal Nicholas Sparks romances where white, pretty people don resort wear to take walks on beaches and barbecue shrimp together."
fresh,Self-help book inspires so-so romance; some peril.
rotten,Nice Guy garbage man Josh Lucas negs sad sack Katie Holmes. Based on the pernicious self-help philosophy that insists that everything wrong with your life is your fault. You know: feel-good romance!
fresh,"Easy to trash, yes, but it's a movie that does what it's supposed to do without fuss or pretense."
rotten,"If you're looking for 107 minutes of utter pabulum disguised as a motion picture with characters and a plot, well, you should ""Dare to Dream"" no more."
rotten,"A dumb, silly and treacly concoction that will sorely test the patience of anyone who tries to sit through it without the aid of a box or two of wine."
fresh,"It's otherwise an admirably mellow experience... But zoomed out just a bit, Dare to Dream reveals more insidious dimensions."
rotten,"Good intentions aside, this is not a good film. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"...the kindness of this movie only amplifies how implausible and irresponsible all this ""Secret"" stuff truly seems to be."
rotten,"In the time of uncertainties amidst a pandemic, I welcome a film with a hopeful & uplifting message, sadly this one is pretty much drowned out by its own schmaltz."
rotten,You won't derive much inspiration from The Secret: Dare to Dream besides some unintentional laughter to briefly brighten your day.
fresh,This one's for the dreamers. The predictable but satisfying romance features a charming Holmes and Lucas. You'll either fall in love with this film or hurl.
fresh,It is a nice change of pace to see a studio like Lionsgate make a film that promotes positivity without it being about religion.
rotten,"The bayou scenery is nice, although for a movie about the power of positive thinking, the relentless contrivances and heavy-handed melodrama tend to have the opposite effect."
fresh,Its sincerity is admirable.
rotten,"The Secret: Dare to Dream at best feels like a tepid distraction even for those receptive to its blueprint, far from the stuff that dreams are made of."
rotten,"The Secret: Dare to Dream isn't a nightmare, but..."
rotten,"""The Secret: Dare to Dream"" is innocent and innocuous enough to make Nicholas Sparks look like David Lynch."
rotten,"The Secret: Dare to Dream definitely isn't a good movie, but it's a far worse sales pitch."
rotten,If you tried to parody 'The Secret's world view to make it look bad it couldn't be much worse than 'The Secret: Dare To Dream.'
rotten,"Perhaps there was a time when this very old fashioned romance could have been viewed as, I don't know, sweet?"
fresh,"A self help movie importing the key message from Rhonda Byrne's 2006 Best Seller ""The Secret"" in which Katie Holmes and Josh Lucas pull out the emotional beats to speak to the true believers and give them hope in troubled times."
fresh,"Once you start this film, you might not want it to end."
rotten,"It's the sort of movie in which kids express their desire for a pepperoni pizza during a torrential storm, and a few seconds later a pizza deliveryman miraculously appears at their front door."
rotten,"""The Secret: Dare to Dream,"" a romantic drama about the power of magical thinking, may not be the worst movie of 2020, but it has to be the dopiest."
rotten,"It's a frothy, forgettable translation of the hit book that takes its central belief system and uses it as the basis for a vaguely magical romantic drama for moms."
fresh,'The Secret: Dare to Dream' is positively uplifting.
rotten,"Whoever put the new film ""The Secret: Dare To Dream"" on their vision board should be locked up."
rotten,"There will be a receptive audience for it, especially with viewers willing and able to put in the time to mind-bend this effort into a better movie."
rotten,"Littered with confounding clichés and hokey devices, it's the exact inverse of what a passionate romance should aspire to be, let alone one preaching the power of positivity."
rotten,They should have put a better movie on their vision board.
rotten,"The film becomes so bad that no amount of positive thinking - as recommended by Rhonda Byrne's 2006 mega-selling nonfiction book ""The Secret,"" from which this narrative film is drawn - can save it."
rotten,As generic and bland a tale you can possibly get ... feels more like a Lifetime movie than something particularly revelatory.
rotten,"A genial, but increasingly absurd romantic drama."
fresh,Charming and impeccably scored...
rotten,"Thoroughly preposterous, utter bourgeois fantasy of a romantic comedy."
fresh,"Kate Winslet is one of my all-time favorite actresses. She's known for making heavy dramas and period pieces, but I love seeing her in a lighter, more comedic movie..."
fresh,"Not much more than a trans-Atlantic take on the same gloopy matters addressed by Love Actually, but it an effective date movie nonetheless."
fresh,"While some people might accuse Meyers of sleepwalking in her latest film, The Holiday, it still worked for me thanks to a likable cast and some rather smart dialogue."
fresh,A great example of an affable rom-com. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"You begin to suspect that Meyers isn't actually a movie director at all, but a features coordinator at World of Interiors."
fresh,"Nancy Meyers pulls off a classic comedy tribute...the cast pull it off, selling their characters' singlehood, nailing their occasional sight gags and earning our laughs and tears, which often occur in the same scene."
fresh,"The Holiday is what you want out of a romantic comedy, without expecting the moon."
fresh,"Nancy Meyers is a whiz at turning out fun, frothy commercial fare."
rotten,"Grindingly predictable and sickeningly convenient, it's as false as a plastic tree."
fresh,"The Holiday is as corny as it gets, but in a cinemascape full of macho grunting and aggressive irony, Meyers is perhaps right to believe that corniness is what women - and their boyfriends - will be wanting..."
rotten,Isn't it reassuring to know in these troubled times that it's possible for gorgeous rich people to find love?
rotten,Each scene in The Holiday is more annoying than the last.
fresh,One of the best date movies I have seen this year.
fresh,Who cares if the housing-swap conceit makes little to no sense?
fresh,"What makes The Holiday interesting - and worth reexamining more than a decade after its release - is that unlike most holiday-themed movies, it exhorts the viewer to take time for themselves, not just others. It's the ultimate self-care flick."
fresh,"If you're looking for a ""good"" movie, I don't recommend this one, but if you want something fun that you can still understand after vaping all afternoon, ""The Holiday"" is perfect."
rotten,"Even with the beautiful view, this is one holiday I wish I hadn't taken."
rotten,"A reminder to all producers: alluding to iconic romantic comedies in a bid for legitimacy can be a dangerous game, even when you have appealing stars."
rotten,Patronizing antimatter
rotten,Dialogue hits the floor like frozen eggnog in writer/director Nancy Meyers' protracted exercise in cliché-mining.
fresh,"It was if I was watching two simultaneous films, while by themselves may not have been too arresting, but cut apart and pieced together made an absolutely fun and winsome date movie."
rotten,I have absolutely no qualms in saying that I didn't really like it.
fresh,"My reaction to The Holiday was no different from my reaction to Meyers' other pieces. It's cute enough, the atmosphere is sufficiently romantic comedy-like, but somehow, for some reason, I just don't bond with it."
fresh,"As a voracious consumer of chick media (I like alien shoot 'em ups too!), I tell you that the story arc is extremely surprising & delightful, and that you fellas can feel safe watching this as well."
rotten,"No amount of ironic gift wrapping can conceal the triteness within, in this double-plotted festive chick flick that is too long by half, and too cloyingly sweet to be healthy."
rotten,"About as far removed from burning your bra as you can get. Too much of this chick flick feels like work, with the unfortunately long running time sandbagging it with a kind of cinematic jet lag."
fresh,"a warm, charming, extremely clever and often hilarious romantic comedy that will be a sure-fire date movie for any guy looking to please his significant other"
rotten,"Meyers gives it an honest shot, but she can't distract from a paint-by-numbers plot just by having us watch it dry."
rotten,"While the director tips her hat to classic Hollywood comedies -- Iris watches Howard Hawks's His Girl Friday for lessons in leading-lady ""gumption"" -- The Holiday wallows in too much earnest relationship talk, without saying much."
fresh,"Because everyone is rich and in love, you can see the happy ending coming a mile away, but with a film like this, it's the journey that's important and not the destination."
rotten,"Sweet, sentimental and sickly."
fresh,A leisurely feelgood rom-com.
fresh,"A lot of ideas are circulating and the characters have taken hold of our emotions. If only Meyers had taken the quickest way there, it would be a much better movie."
fresh,The Holiday's redeeming feature (and it's a considerable one) is the 91-year-old Eli Wallach's astute and endearing performance.
fresh,"Give this to The Holiday: It lives up to its title. The writer-producer-director, Nancy Meyers, who last created the delightful Something's Gotta Give, knows how to throw a yuletide bash."
fresh,"The movie clocks in at just under two and a half hours, so the staying-awake part may be a challenge for some, but not one scene in the film feels extraneous or doesn't serve to tell the story."
rotten,"Watchable, but overly long and ultimately disappointing romcom, despite spirited performances and the occasional sparkly moment."
rotten,"This romantic comedy ends up feeling soggy, syrupy and so bloating it'll put you to sleep before the pudding's done."
rotten,
rotten,"It would seem that Meyers wanted to make an old-fashioned romantic comedy but the result is formulaic and phony. And no amount of crying, conga lines, cute children, champagne or Christmas cheer can change that."
rotten,
fresh,An entertaining romp that succeeds on a level of pure escapism.
rotten,Nancy Meyers é uma diretora medíocre e uma escritora sem talento.
rotten,"The Holiday pretends its happy endings are premised on the women realizing their capacities as leading ladies. Really, what they're doing is finding the ""right"" men, not quite the same as finding ""gumption."""
fresh,The Holiday works its magic because Meyers invests time in the characters instead of the scenarios.
fresh,Writer-director Nancy Meyers' fluff machine is on overdrive...
fresh,"A very pretty, safely balanced, sweet and sour film, for some nice bonding time with your other half."
fresh,"Running away from a broken heart has never been so much fun as in The Holiday, a delightful romantic comedy about love, life and making a change."
rotten,At least 60 percent of this film tries too hard to be as cute as a Christmas puppy and just ends up piddling on the carpet
fresh,"A finely polished piece of romantic cinema, with a generosity of spirit so all-encompassing that it's easy to forgive its occasional excesses."
rotten,Saying that Nancy Meyers' The Holiday is the best of the year's Christmas movies to date isn't saying very much.
fresh,We can all figure out where this thing is going but getting there is the prime attraction here.
rotten,"There are bad movies, and then there are Nancy Meyers movies."
rotten,"Myers has established herself as Nora Ephron Lite, which is the same as establishing yourself as white bread without the crust."
rotten,Fast food merchandising of the heart.
rotten,"Despite the honeyed charms of its female leads, the 138-minute Holiday wears out its welcome ... When Diaz meets Law's cloyingly adorable two girls, it's like choking to death on a saccharine candy cane."
fresh,"Through its awkward meet-stupids and believable meet-cutes, ""The Holiday"" rings so many notes of joy that you can't help but like it."
rotten,It takes a certain amount of power to convince four talented actors to deliver performances that are shrill and irritating.
rotten,The Holiday is too predictable and at 138 minutes way too padded to thoroughly enjoy.
rotten,"Nancy Meyers' trademark thinking comedies always deliver a perceptive perspective on relationships, but this one forgets to be funny too."
rotten,"There's a minute glimmer of joy to be had from this frosty piece of cake, but you have to work awfully hard to find it."
rotten,There's nothing authentic or personal about The Holiday -- it's as chilling as heart-warmers get.
fresh,"The characters pace and putter around in the story like animals building their nests, and by the time they finally settle down with their mates, we have a grudging affection for them."
fresh,"There's good news for Jude Law fans. With The Holiday, the actor has taken a sad career song and started to make it better."
rotten,...The story goes on at untoward length.
rotten,"...The surprises would be surprises only if this is, like, your fourth movie ever."
fresh,"Admittedly, this is a chick-flick. Guys may groan but gals are gonna love it. Like 'Love, Actually,' it's the Christmas comedy you've been waiting for."
fresh,"While Meyers overwrites and has a tendency to dwell on her stars goofing around, her best material makes the less-successful stretches worth sitting through."
fresh,"Watching The Holiday is a little like ordering a sticky cinnamon bun: You know the gooey, warm sweetness will taste good, but you'll feel guilty eating it."
fresh,It's actually one of the most educational chick flicks of the decade...
fresh,"Admitting that it's formulaic doesn't make it any less so, but it's enjoyable in a mushy, easily digested sort of way."
rotten,"...It's the women who come out the worst in Meyers's sexist worldview, where men are hopeless and women are helpless."
fresh,"Winslet, who's never done a Hollywood romantic comedy before, turns out to be a natural, blushing prettily and smiling so broadly the camera seems ready to embrace her."
rotten,The Holiday suffers from a dreary predictability.
rotten,"Winslet, Black, Law and to some extent the others are often swell. But the script limits are still there, knots in the weave, and you need to be a goner for manipulation not to notice."
rotten,"Winslet gets time to build a lovable, kind character. In the process, the English actress known for serious roles shows she can handle just about any part -- even one in a formulaic American romantic comedy -- with exceptional grace."
fresh,"It's a pleasant-enough premise for a romantic comedy, created by an experienced veteran (director Nancy Meyers), and is boosted by entertaining performances."
fresh,The sheer volume of intense emotional content has a cumulative effect that will easily win over anyone whose heart and mind are open to it.
rotten,Winslet brings a sweet enthusiasm to Iris' emotional blooming that makes you wish Diaz... had taken a holiday.
fresh,"It is a fizzy champagne cocktail that provides a pleasant buzz, many smiles, and Jude Law with the role of his career."
rotten,There is evidence in The Holiday that the declining value of the dollar appears to have distorted the status of leading men on both sides of the pond.
fresh,"Any holiday movie with a dollop of sweetness and a touch of wistful deserves a little slack at this time of year. This one is pleasant enough, but The Holiday won't be one you'll remember after the eggnog has worn off."
fresh,"For all its charm, there's nothing in The Holiday you haven't seen in a dozen romantic comedies."
fresh,"The movie, which runs two hours-plus, has its highs and lulls, but the charismatic cast offsets flawed storytelling."
rotten,"Complaining about the gooey and generic The Holiday is as useless as railing against fruitcake -- this is a slick, throwaway chick flick designed to provide nothing more than mindless diversion between bouts of shopping."
fresh,The Holiday is a harmlessly cheery confection.
rotten,"Although it is inoffensive and well-intentioned, The Holiday is neither the sum of its parts nor an especially effective whole."
fresh,"This melding of comedic minds is one of the better holiday gifts we've received, cinematically speaking."
fresh,"There is so much to not like about The Holiday. Yet this humorous romantic fantasy is really, really easy to enjoy."
rotten,"[Director Nancy Meyers] hits all the notes of the chick-flick formula -- heartbreak, ice cream, Aretha Franklin -- but she never creates a melody."
rotten,Way too much cute.
rotten,"The Holiday, like the holidays, will require some girding up, and is best met halfway with a self-immunizing smile."
rotten,"Obviously intended as a romantic throwback to the good old days of Hollywood, The Holiday instead comes off as a self-indulgent, insipid piece of seasonal trash."
fresh,The Holiday is as advertised: a respite from everyday demands and acquired cynicism.
rotten,This romantic comedy has an almost terminal case of the cutes.
fresh,"The Holiday isn't a great movie, but it should appeal to those who like their movies comfortably upholstered and primed to tug at the heart strings."
rotten,"The problem with Nancy Meyer's romantic comedy The Holiday is that it is contrived, too long, and insufferably cute."
rotten,The Holiday is a drippily sentimental and contrived movie that ladles on the treacle with a particularly heavy hand and strands some good actors -- and not so good ones -- along the way.
rotten,"The Holiday is a lark, with pretensions to be more."
fresh,"Truth be told, this movie isn't rocket science. If you don't know what happens than you certainly don't watch enough cinematic entertainment. This thing is about as predictable as Mom's Apple Pie and, thankfully, just as delicious."
fresh,"Brace yourselves. Writer/director has made a romantic comedy in which the plot complications do not depend on one or both halves of the couple in question behaving like a ditz or a jerk, nor even seriously misunderstanding each other."
rotten,"Everyone in the cast knows how to act, but it looks like they gave their talent a holiday and showed up on the set clueless."
fresh,Bridget Jones's Diary meets L.A. Story in this feel-good romantic chuckler doused with a healthy layer of seasonal schmaltz.
rotten,"every time the film threatens to build up a head of genuine charm, it bogs down in treacley melodrama and/or maudlin sentiment"
fresh,"'The Holiday' is a fun, warm, and lighthearted romantic comedy that's easy to settle into."
fresh,Romantic comedies have been a bit of a dying breed in recent years. Perhaps that's why it's so delightful to see The Holiday tucked amidst all the war and gore at the cineplex.
rotten,Might be considered a decent date movie... but only if guys were allowed to leave their testicles at home.
rotten,"No formulaic romantic comedy needs to be over 100 minutes, let alone over 130."
rotten,"At one point Amanda remarks, 'In the world of love, cheating is not acceptable.' Also no longer acceptable: romantic comedies set in 'the world of love.'"
rotten,"If Nancy Meyers were to have sex with James L. Brooks, she still wouldn't have enough of him in her to craft worthwhile material."
fresh,"After such a horrible run of dreadful, I-want-to-poke-my-eyes-out-to-stop-the-pain holiday movies (Deck The Halls and The Santa Clause 3), The Holiday practically looks like the Citizen Kane of Christmas tales."
rotten,After sitting through 138 minutes viewers may feel they've earned a real holiday.
rotten,"It really is stunning how at odds the two halves of the movie are. Almost everything on the Diaz side... is weird or uncomfortable or icky or just plain nonsensical, and almost everything on the Winslet side... is smart and cozy and affectionate and just"
fresh,"[The Holiday] largely entertains, but has no business being two hours and 15 minutes long."
fresh,It's hard to say whether the movie is being meta in its movie references or just unimaginative and derivative. Probably a little bit of both.
rotten,"Meyers' movies would be far less offensive if they were simply shiny, shallow entertainments. But they always read like pronouncements, monitor readings of how 'real' women think and feel."
fresh,"If you're willing to embrace a bit of corniness for the sake of some incisive humor, a few poignant moments and enjoyable scenarios, make time for The Holiday."
fresh,"Like a magic trick in reverse, The Holiday reveals the mechanics of the formula while trying to keep up the illusion."
rotten,"Its undeniable dramatic, narrative, and audiovisual shortcomings undermine any attempt to, at the very least, entertain with its repertoire of setpieces for viewers over 18."
rotten,"If they're going to make Statham's Lee Christmas the star, time to latch onto the latest action trend. Set it during Christmas, give it a Christmas pun for a title, wrap some tinsel around a knife, and 5LAY RIDE is a sure-fire hit."
rotten,A glorified made for TV movie that beyond all odds made it to the cinemas - EXPEND4BLES is a callback to the direct to video sequels that exceeded their limit.
fresh,"Though the stunts are good, sometimes the backdrops are questionable."
fresh,"While there is arguably only one extended sequence that truly pays its way, there is consistent value to be drawn from Statham’s work here. Not only as a leading man, but also a lightning rod to spark his co-stars into action when needed."
rotten,Same old same old.
rotten,"Though running at around 100 minutes, Expend4bles’s plot is paper thin and brimming with stilted conversation."
rotten,"While the first three films in the series showed grit and charm as they brought together old and new action stars for B-movie mayhem, Expend4ables is an embarrassing comedown."
rotten,"Never has a title been more apt, whatever nails weren’t secured in the coffin of this series following the misguided part 3 are more than bashed to obliteration here."
rotten,"At this point, you know what you're getting into: this is either your thing or it's not. It's not for critics, overly sensitive people, or those looking for a cinematic masterpiece.  It's for those that want to relive those silly '80s action matinees."
fresh,"It's the third best out of the four, but better than [The Expendables 3] -- and still very entertaining."
rotten,"What should've been a fun, silly action movie (like its predecessors, and especially the second one), ended up becoming a frustrating experience, with poor visual effects, dumb dialogue (and weak one-liners), and very poor action. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"If Expend4bles turns out to be a swan song, it’s a fitting one, since it so neatly encapsulates the series’ formula."
rotten,"Besides the cacophonous dialogue and spasmodic storytelling on the part of the director, the actors simply don’t appear to have much invested in their roles any more"
rotten,An embarrassing excuse of an action film
rotten,The fourth installment of the Expendables franchise narrows its scope with middling results.
rotten,"This isn't just a bad movie, it is a boring one -- not exactly what you would want in a film that relies on non-stop action."
rotten,"The series, mercifully, has some potential, but it’s hard to see any of it in this risible, frequently exasperating, piece of sadism."
rotten,... Lament4bly predict4ble stuff.
rotten,"Expend4bles betrays so much of the series’ comforts and pleasures, and the roster of action heavyweights (and their characters) that delivered them, that it was really a project not worth doing in the end."
rotten,The shocking twist during the first act is quickly wasted away when generic Action tropes takes center stage in the most tiresome sequel of the franchise so far.
rotten,It's just a huge waste of people with incredible talent.
rotten,"For a franchise that has never really lived up to its potential, it’s kind of amazing to see it find new lows."
rotten,"The punches were pulled, the writing was bad, and the action was forgettable. 99.9% of this was genuinely bad, despite it leaning into its own ridiculousness. In terms of your watch list, the movie lives up to its title."
rotten,The worst farewell possible. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Almost a decade after part 3, old and new faces gather for another slice of pointless action. The script is flimsier than ever, never bothering to create characters while only barely connecting random fight and stunt sequences."
rotten,Some of the most appallingly cheap-looking digital effects this side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
rotten,Dull and tasteless. The insertion of “4” [in the title] is unfortunately just about the most clever thing the fourth installment of this action series has to offer.
rotten,"Expend4bles fails to live up to the gusto and fun of the first three films, despite star Jason Statham doing everything he can to elevate it."
rotten,"Expend4bles features a storyline that would make an elementary schooler chortle at its lack of originality. This isn’t second-rate 007, it’s third-rate Fast and Furious."
rotten,"Audiences can expect 90-ish minutes of ho-hum action bolstered by CGI gunfire, blood and backgrounds, very little of which would be convincing enough for a mid-range PlayStation title, let alone a “blockbuster” with a reported budget of $100 million."
rotten,"It must also be said that most of the jokes aren't good, even if they are in excess in the banter (thinking that more is better does not help in this case). [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"This is a dumb-as-rocks exercise in violence and stupidity, which represents a low for a franchise that was already scraping the bottom of the barrel, and it's on the very short list of candidates for the year's worst movie."
rotten,"Dull, predictable and completely lacking any good one-liners or likeable characters, the only thing you’re rooting for is the end."
rotten,The knuckle-headed appeal of this dopey action franchise has finally evaporated with its latest instalment aka Expend-Four-Bles!
rotten,"Once you’ve resorted to casting Megan Fox as a credible action star, it’s time to wrap it up and call it a franchise."
rotten,"It is resolutely terrible, far beyond any sort of guilty pleasure viewing. There is no pleasure to be found in this fourth film, only guilt."
rotten,"I think it’s time to let this franchise die. With a humorless script, an uninspired plot, and the most predictable twist of all time, this film limps along, as tired and creaky as the senior citizens in its cast."
rotten,"“Expend4dbles” wants to be the kind of movie that’s best seen on cable with commercial breaks or on a beat-up VHS tape, but there are far more entertaining classics that can get the job done. There’s no need to enlist this tired team."
rotten,Nothing here makes sense.
rotten,"The action is not engaging, the gaps in logic are overlaid with the loud music, the stunts are silly, and the one-liners fall flat with a soft, apologetic squelch"
rotten,It mostly left me feeling expendable.
rotten,Watching the cast of Expend4bles... sweating and straining their way through the “casual banter” section of the screenplay is like watching contestants on The World’s Strongest Man attempting to climb a ladder while carrying a tractor tyre.
rotten,Might be the new definition of drivel.
rotten,"This one isn't the worst entry in the series, but it's not very good, either; it has a few amusing character moments and some decent fights, but most of it is draggy and repetitive."
rotten,"Expendables 4 might easily be mistaken for a straight-to-DVD release that relies more on explosions and R-rated deaths than genuine, pulse-pounding action."
rotten,"It’s the fourth movie, and the franchise is still trying to decide existential questions like is this about old-school action stars or new wannabes, as well as whether to shoot it for a PG-13 or an R rating."
rotten,"Expend4bles is rife with clichés, and it is evident that the cast and crew did not believe in reinventing the wheel."
rotten,"I had a feeling this was going to be bad, but “Expend4bles” still found a way to exceed my wildest expectations."
rotten,"Expend4bles is a serious contender for the year’s stupidest movie, and that’s not just for the awkwardly stylized title."
fresh,What we end up with is a hefty serving of unabashed fan food. It’s a movie meal custom-cooked for fans and it should satisfy the appetites of those hungry for more goofy banter and gleefully violent action.
rotten,“The Disposables” would describe it better.
rotten,"A cheap and cheerless sequel, Expend4bles gets old real fast."
rotten,"The characterisations here are functional at best, and attempts at humorous banter between Statham and Stallone feel limp and forced. Still, the action sequences are slick and speedy."
rotten,"Plot, you say? What plot? In a word: negligible."
fresh,"Come for the blood, gore and one-liners -- stay for a fun and touching plot twist at the end that I, for one, didn’t see coming."
rotten,Dumb.
rotten,"In an action film landscape that has recently delivered great films like “John Wick: Chapter 4” and “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One” this year alone, maybe it’s time that “The Expendables” retire for good."
rotten,"If all you want is a body count, then the annoyingly named Expend4bles will satisfy that bloodlust. Just know the same experience can be had at home with a good first-person shooter video game."
rotten,"Of the Expendables crew, Jason Statham's the one that exhibits any sort of screen presence or charisma. The rest of the crew eels like they're here out of some sort of contractual obligation."
fresh,"As a super-violent action film comedy, ""Expend4bles has its merits, Stallone being one, even though he is absent for much of the  time."
rotten,"Expend4bles resembles a rundown car running on fumes and sputtering out its last gasps as it slows to a crawl and a sad stop. The sequel isn’t even an entertaining car crash. It’s just a poorly made, incoherent piece of cinematic junk."
fresh,...a top-notch entry within a fairly consistent action-movie series...
rotten,"At the end of the day, Expend4bles is nothing more than one of your standard-issue Statham actioners that proved moderately popular for a decade beginning around 2005."
rotten,[A] laughably lazy exercise in utility-grade meat-and-potatoes filmmaking.
rotten,"There are certainly shorter erectile dysfunction advertisements and with more believable settings and backdrops. Forget worrying about an erection that lasts four hours. ""Expend4bles"" can't even maintain excitement for four minutes."
fresh,"Very little of it makes sense, and slapdash visual effects show in some scenes. On the other hand, Jason Statham ... calls a bad guy a sneaky little sausage. So it's fine."
rotten,"With the series running on fumes at this point, it’s time to blow it up."
rotten,"Nobody appears to be having any fun in Expend4bles, so at least we can empathize with the actors."
rotten,"The novelty of assembling the greatest action stars in history has more than worn off, especially considering most have abandoned the series altogether. If they don’t care for it, why should anyone else?"
rotten,"Statham fighting skills can't carry this mess of a movie. There's plenty of wasted talent, a weak script, and Megan Fox is horribly miscast."
rotten,"Whilst its predecessors varied in quality, its fourth outing is comfortably the worst. This franchise is past its prime—time to put it out of its misery and send it to the retirement home."
fresh,a serviceable action film that will likely satisfy those in search of violence and explosions.
rotten,"The bar was already so low, and yet this film manages to sneak under it."
rotten,"Expend4bles delivers quips and kills galore, but to paraphrase Tony Jaa’s character Decha, “The more people you kill, the less joy you have.”"
rotten,"The clip is out of ammo on this franchise that has NEVER lived up to its potential, and this is the worst of them all."
rotten,"The fun final act is absolutely not enough to save a movie that is two-thirds boring, but it does at least elevate Expend4bles above the irredeemable third movie."
rotten,"With such a dismal fourth instalment, it may be time to put the Expendables on ice."
fresh,"…passable, forgettable action cinema for hardened veterans with an emphasis on nostalgic indulgence…"
rotten,"To paraphrase the poetic lyricist 50 Cent, I don’t know what you have heard about Expend4bles, but it is mother****** C-R-A-P"
rotten,"'EXPEND4BLES' is comfortably the weakest entry in the franchise so far, making it look as if the decision to dust off the property following a near decade-long absence was the wrong call."
rotten,Many involved stopped trying on the first take or third rewrite. It’s just gassed.
rotten,"An inane, tedious and exhausting action thriller that's heavy on action, but light on the suspense and palpable thrills. It's essentially a long, dull video game."
rotten,"Expendables 4 is mind-numbing, an awful entry into the series that stood no chance of being one of the better installments in a franchise that — much like its heroes — is long past its prime."
rotten,The film’s last reel is so awful — so sneeringly contemptuous of our good-faith efforts to play along with these shenanigans — that we leave the theater still thinking of that shot of a corpse's middle finger. It sure seemed pointed at us.
rotten,Expend4bles feels like a bargain-brand imitation of the series it’s part of — a regression in quality that’s achingly visible on screen between billowing fireballs and splattered noggins.
fresh,The most bombastic action movie of the year
rotten,"Expend4bles is a bloated, festering corpse with a gaping head wound floating face down in the river at the bottom of the hill that the buzzards don’t even want any part of."
rotten,Expend4bles: wh4t a lo4d of cr4p.
rotten,Expendabes 4 is ambushed by its own utter lack of new ideas or better ways to use the talents of the many charismatic actors who did turn up to work for various lengths of time.
rotten,"Weirdly flat, unable to cook up exciting sequences for the crew as they slowly assemble to take on a generic enemy in a sequel that’s nowhere near as entertaining as previous adventures."
rotten,The best that can be said about The Expend4ble s is that it at least it acknowledges Statham is the star.
rotten,"Passable for fans of the franchise, but by far the worst entry in the franchise. The VFX are quite frankly embarrassing. But Statham is good and teams up well with a very funny Tony Jaa. Far from theater worthy though."
rotten,It all gets very tiresome. It doesn’t help that the special effects sometimes seem thrown together with about as much care as the script
rotten,"For all its efforts at wit, Expend4bles offers exactly two kinds of laughs: unintentional (seriously, the explosion effects and green-screen moments are hilarious) and unearned (the joke that lands best is a direct quote from another movie)."
rotten,"To the extent that The Expendables 4 succeeds, and by most reasonable terms it does not, it’s predicated on pairing ol’ Stath with various other stars to trade testy barbs, affectionate barbs or meaningful glances."
rotten,"Old-school rough-and-readiness is kind of the point of the Expendables brand and the films have never been masterworks, but now the hokum has gone from well worn to worn out."
rotten,"It makes for the worst Expendables yet. The occasional moment of machine gun motorcycle jousting aside, it is a largely dull and dreary experience that never feels like it is ever anything more than a hollow mimicry of far better action works of the past."
rotten,Expend4bles feels less like the next installment in a beloved franchise and more like the aborted pilot for a straight-to-streaming spinoff shoved into theaters at the last minute.
rotten,"""Expend4bles"" may be the best of the series. This is not a compliment to Waugh's film, but a mere note on how badly this series of films has fared over the last 13 years."
rotten,"If “they’ll die when they’re dead”, The Expendables 4 is the ultimate death knell."
rotten,"Lackluster on practically every level, this ought to be renamed The Disposables as it’s a giant waste of everyone’s time and talent."
rotten,"Expend4bles stretches the franchise to its limits, and those limits frankly don’t reach very far."
fresh,"... Installment number four of the elite mercenaries series manages to not be entirely extraneous to our entertainment needs, disarming as often with easy charm, as with a high-kick to the hyoid."
fresh,"The movie is unsurprising and not especially ambitious, but it’s agile enough to vault over most of its flaws."
rotten,An unbelievably dull action thriller.
fresh,"It took the franchise four tries, but with “Expend4bles,” they’ve finally made a solid and consistently effective action movie."
rotten,"A slight improvement on Expendables 3, Expend4bles still works better as character posters than a movie you have to actually sit through. To paraphrase the tag line, old blood meets new blood equals tired blood."
rotten,This may be the first “Expendables” movie that doesn’t feel linked to the old Cannon Films spirit of trash taken to the extreme. This is true 21st-century trash: a movie in which the action itself is expendable.
rotten,"[A] hideously constructed, beautifully 90-minute orgy of stupid ideas and silly executions..."
rotten,More like the dispos4bles.
rotten,"Expend4bles is not a good film by any objective standard. But as preposterous as it is, a movie that offers up beloved beasts like Stallone, Statham, Lundgren et al and sets them to work noisily slaughtering bad guys, at least has goodwill going for it."
rotten,"Expend4bles has a vague understanding of what you like, but no resolve to make sure you have fun. You can figure that one out yourself."
rotten,"As ever, the guys are texting it in – or most of them, as Statham always looks as if he could handle some comic dialogue (or any sort of dialogue) if he was given the chance."
rotten,These aren’t the Expendables returning for a new adventure; they’re the leftovers sitting around in want of something to do.
rotten,"Fun in a B-movie kind of way, but still a bargain basement afterthought. All involved deserved a better send-off."
rotten,"The definition of Expendable is “of relatively little significance, and therefore able to be abandoned or destroyed.” It used to refer to the disposability of these guns-for-hire. Sadly now, it refers to the franchise as a whole."
rotten,"It would have been great to have rounded the series off with a fifth entry, but after this flat and uninspired effort, the franchise doesn’t deserve that last hoorah."
rotten,"Tony Jaa and Iko Uwais are the standouts in this, but even they aren’t enough to drag this out of the mire of mediocrity to make it memorable. Wait until it hits VOD where your investment will then match the movie’s CGI budget."
fresh,"Excellent fight scenes, lots of guns, massive explosions, and some truly horrific and gory kills including a decapitation you never see coming."
rotten,"The Nun II might be a slight step up from the slog that was The Nun, but that’s a low bar to creep up from."
fresh,"Does not claim that its storytelling integrity is more important to it than providing a nice, rickety old thrill ride of bumps and shocks."
rotten,"It settles for a half-baked story and the same old never-ending series of cheap, lazy, and ineffective jump scares, ultimately making this sequel an even more forgettable horror outing than the original."
fresh,Director Michael Chaves (The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do it) starts the film with plenty of energy and continues the pacing throughout the duration of the movie.
fresh,"The Nun 2 isn't as compelling as the first installment, and feels a bit scattered, but it serves as a worthy sequel that expands on the demonic lore, adding in some new jump scares."
rotten,You’ll lose your faith in this movie before you’re even halfway through it.
fresh,"From the first scene to the last, this director proves to have the skills for a better screenplay. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Despite some effective scares, The Nun 2 offers stereotypical scares and a story that lacks any real urgency and is bogged down in over explanation."
fresh,"Despite the scares being a tad repetitive, they are made and photographed well, meanwhile, the special effects are first-rate.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"...the movie segues into a seriously (and typically) stagnant midsection almost entirely devoid of attention-grabbing, compelling attributes..."
rotten,There are certain moments from the original The Conjuring that have stuck with me for a decade and counting. I’d be surprised if I remember anything from The Nun II within the next couple of weeks.
fresh,"Leveraging girl’s school games, gothic locations, and a few decently disturbing moments, Michael Chaves finally delivers the goods missing in his previous Conjuring Universe efforts… even enough to forgive another in a long line of misdirection McGuffins."
fresh,"While the story is lackluster and poorly told, the film delivers the jump scares and creepy imagery that fans of this franchise have come to expect. The Nun II is an effective thrill-ride and little else."
fresh,The Nun II is one is one of my genuine surprises of 2023. It is a film that is not only going to be embraced by fans of The Conjuring universe but is going to be universally loved by horror fans as a whole.
fresh,"The Catholic horror wheel isn’t reinvented, but the jump scares are so nonstop and occasionally clever that I was left wondering: is this the most fun I’ve had at the movies all summer?"
fresh,Taissa Farmiga returns as Sister Irene for cloistered encounters of the second kind. Darker and more frightening than its predecessor. The gothic atmosphere and shadowy glimpses of the terrifying nun make for the perfect horror atmosphere.
rotten,"Well made, entertaining, scary Nun of the above."
fresh,"…The Nun films seem to be successful even as the over-arching Conjuring narrative sputters, largely because they deliver such visually imaginative shocks, even if the connective tissue between the visuals turns out to be rather unimportant…"
fresh,"A step up (however slight) from the first film, The Nun II is still a mess, but it's an entertaining mess."
fresh,"The Nun 2 is exactly what I wanted the first film to be - creative jump scares, evenly paced without being weighed down by exposition, and quite entertaining."
rotten,"The movie then becomes almost a comical race against the clock, “Da Vinci Code”-style, as Irene and Debra travel through various cities until they discover a Vatican archive where they are informed of the existence of the fourth century St. Lucy."
rotten,"This horror sequel certainly looks good, but rather than spending time on atmosphere or character, it concentrates on powering through its silly story and generating typical jump scares."
fresh,"Screenwriters Ian Goldberg, Richard Naing, and especially Akela Cooper, who explore Wan's material with simplicity and cunning, renew the franchise and steer the movie into an almost existential terror. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"I actually like this better than the first Nun, in terms of its atmosphere, in terms of its mood; and then eventually 4:59 there is some emotional groundedness that the first one lacks."
fresh,"The Nun II doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it rolls well, and much better than The Nun did. While it might not be the most terrifying or unexpected of the Conjuring movies, Chaves delivers a solid entry in the franchise."
fresh,A solid horror thriller with some great mystery and some surefire scary images...
fresh,"It features all the visuals one would expect from a film like this —floating people, characters with demonic voices and red eyes, sudden and disturbing appearances of the titular Nun. It's predictable, but overall, quite well done. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"Your mileage may vary on a mid-credits tease that further hints at future directions the franchise will take, yet there's no denying the grip that these movies — like Valak itself — continue to have on us."
fresh,"I was never bored by this sequel, and even if I always knew how things were going to work themselves out, my eyes nonetheless remained glued to the screen."
rotten,Send it to hell.
rotten,"Although this one is an improvement from the first film, it's still not that strong of an entry in the universe. The atmosphere is great and the jump scares are solid, but there are way too few scares and very little of the title character herself."
fresh,The Michael Chaves-directed sequel is a messy but entertaining one that finally seems to justify this sub-franchise’s existence.
fresh,"Michael Chaves' direction is as effective as it is lazy when shooting the same idea over and over again, revitalizing us only with a successful plot excuse to link this story within the great Warren saga... [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"If you were disappointed by the 2018 The Nun, this movie is sure to lift your spirits with its scarier, more unpredictable moments and imagery surrounding the antagonist — brought to life by Bonnie Aarons."
fresh,"This entry absolves the spin-offs' worst sins; it's sometimes sillier than it is scary, but it's never as boring as either its direct predecessor or Chaves's The Curse of La Llorona."
fresh,"The Nun II certainly has a few cinematic sins to confess, but its creative scares and engaging story make it a fun and frightening blockbuster horror."
fresh,"I appreciate the artistry of the film and some of the performances, but the story was lacking and they traded it off for cheap scares."
rotten,"There’s one visually inventive set-piece, but mostly the action is dark, dingy and fatally short of scares."
fresh,"The Nun 2 isn’t groundbreaking for the horror genre, but with an engaging cast and creepy setup after creepy setup, it’s a solid film in The Conjuring franchise with some harrowing moments."
fresh,I found the story and creatives decisions made in this sequel to be significantly better than its predecessors. Really solid performances across the board but the story suffers from too many underwhelming subplots that don't add much to the main plot.
rotten,"A narratively bland sequel that grants star Taissa Farmiga a bit more agency (while wasting Storm Reid), The Nun II proves that while there's plenty of box office in The Conjuring Universe, the storytelling techniques are phoning it in."
fresh,"The Nun II improves certain aspects of Coryn Hardy's offering, giving the two main characters personality and soul... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"As a movie, it adds nothing to the Conjuring franchise or to its premise."
rotten,"Although its visual proposal is interesting, The Nun 2 drowns in its mythology and ends up becoming one of the worst installments in its universe. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Poses elements of interest, but this entertainment is covered in disappointment. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It isn’t as messy as the first, and the third act delivers the right amount of over-the-top scares, but the story is an absolute dud through two acts. The pacing drags, and almost every jump scare is too obvious to be effective or even remotely scary."
fresh,"The Nun herself might be no more frightening than a malnourished panda, but around her, the sets, costuming and art direction are often superb."
rotten,"Although the movie maintains the pace, builds tension and gets to land a few scares, the spin-offs are still way behind the main films in The Conjuring franchise. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,A sequel to a spin-off of a sequel with no reason to exist except the most baldly commercial: the Conjuring Universe is the highest grossing horror franchise of all time and 2018’s The Nun is its most lucrative film yet.
fresh,"The cast, often more talented and skilled than the screenplay demands, delivers uniformly strong, committed performances. Cheaves and his collaborators fill the periodic set pieces with all-enveloping, neo-Gothic darkness."
fresh,"t is unexpected to like The Nun II so much, but in its over-the-top horror and action filled finale there is the sense of a filmmaker looking to shock and surprise, but to do so playfully."
fresh,"The Nun II is a masterpiece in comparison to the first film. It may not be anywhere near getting a spot on a list of best horror films, but when it works, it really works."
rotten,"Not a complete waste of time, though, decidedly underwhelming despite the ickiness. Superbly shot and directed with an understated flair by Michael Chaves, who, along with Taissa Farmiga, gets about as much as can be extracted from an anemic script."
fresh,"It feels more like a drama than a horror movie when Valak is not present, and while imperfect, it's a fun, scary group watch. Fans of The Conjuring universe should add it to their collection."
rotten,"The Nun II is an example of nice, safe, major studio horror. By that, I mean it delivers very familiar elements in a pre-programmed way, with no genuine surprises."
fresh,"A pretty standard religious horror film which lacks the originality & heart of the main Conjuring films.  Still it has solid performances, great locations and some good visuals. Mostly for hardcore horror fans as there's few new elements here."
fresh,"A slick if familiar addition to the very fertile “Conjuring” universe that, by deftly expanding on the 2018 hit, appears destined to become another cinematic habit."
rotten,"This has some decent elements, but it gets a bit too convoluted and goes way too big to retain the necessary “it could happen” element of a possession film."
rotten,This entry into The Conjuring Universe isn’t even bad enough to be amusing and deserves to be thrown on a funeral pyre for its sins.
rotten,"For the first half of this movie, I was bored out of my skull... but I gotta say, the second half of this movie far better than the first."
rotten,"The movie has nothing to say, adds no new layers of intrigue to the overall series, and repeats the same tricks ad nauseam; it exists only to perpetuate a franchise."
rotten,"It's hard to explain how The Nun II even justifies its own existence. Shoehorning a middle chapter serves nothing, and no one, other than to push The Conjuring Universe to nine films,"
rotten,"The screenplay it's predictable, though it's difficult to find originality in such a regurgitated and tiresome genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Putting The Nun II in IMAX is like serving human excrement on a gold-plated platter. “What if this sucked bigger?” is a bold theatrical gambit and a frequently used political strategy these days.
rotten,"If you came to see more of The Nun, you do get it - mainly in the form of subliminal imagery."
rotten,"This happens. Then, that happens. Do they even know their demon nun resembles Alice Cooper?"
rotten,"If you’re looking for nothing more and nothing less than a film where a barbaric nun slaughters everyone in its sight, well, look no further. Everyone else will be nun too pleased."
rotten,an utter snooze.
fresh,It takes everything that worked about The Nun and elevates it while correcting the sins of the past and ramping up tension and scares. A smart script and great performances deliver the emotional depth that helped make The Conjuring films so successful.
rotten,"The Nun 2 rises slightly from its slumber towards the end, by which time I was hoping for the bowels of hell to open up beneath the cinema."
rotten,"Amazing to consider how it's actually been a decade since James Wan's The Conjuring released in 2013, and quite less so amazing to see the McDonalds-ification of this horror property at full strength as it stands in The Nun II."
rotten,"... a technically proficient yet otherwise uninspired follow-up without meaningful twists to drive the suspense, so the plot spins its wheels well before the inevitable climactic showdown between good and evil."
fresh,"...a sequel that is a nice step up from its predecessor, yet one that still hasn’t fully realized its terrifying potential."
fresh,"“The Nun II” is a serviceable “Conjuring” entry that expands the mythology while continuing to build the power of its charismatic hero, Sister Irene."
rotten,"[T]he repetitious setup-and-scare approach ... is much more satisfying than the loud, generic bombast that follows."
rotten,"There's an overall lack of thoughtfulness in “The Nun II” regarding scares, and Chaves is vehemently loyal to oversaturated tropes."
rotten,'The Nun II' suffers by taking itself far too seriously.
rotten,"They’re just trying to get from one jump scare to another, after all. Let’s not pretend they’re thinking about this story."
fresh,An effectively spooky gothic horror that features several well-structured sequences that will frighten movie fans this Halloween season.
fresh,"Michael Chaves is growing as a director, and this might be a situation of 2 worlds colliding at the perfect time. Here we actually have compelling characters, some gorgeous set pieces/locations, as well as genuine and creative scares that work."
rotten,The loud and unnecessary creep chords and jump scares overwhelm the excellent visuals while doing nothing for the weak and insubstantial plot
fresh,"One could argue that there’s way too much screaming going on — I mean, after you’ve seen the demon four or five times, is it really that shocking? — but that’s a minor complaint."
rotten,It's the second Warner Bros. horror sequel in as many months (after MEG 2: THE TRENCH) to give short shrift to its titular creature.
rotten,"The Nun 2 is about on par with the original. Not sure where I fall on this one as the set pieces are great, the production design is eerie, & the genre blend of a murder mystery is intriguing but everything just feels middle of the road… mixed bag"
fresh,"Visually stylish and atmospheric with some palpable scares, but it's also overlong, unsurprising and unimaginative."
rotten,"Mostly a lifeless endeavor, laboring to restart the engine of a one-note idea, getting as far as the heavy recycling of scares before the whole thing limps to a dull conclusion."
rotten,"A random, almost plotless debacle... I was only bored for maybe 100 of the 108 or so minutes of this mess. There’s only so much admiring the production design will do for you."
fresh,"There are a few good jump scares and the demon in full nun regalia is still an unsettling sight, but the movie is just a little too similar to The Nun—it’s another story about Irene and an ancient demon destroying relic—to feel anything but familiar."
rotten,"While a stronger film than its predecessor, it still suffers from the same things that plagued that one."
fresh,Here’s another helping of lavish pseudo-religious hokum...
fresh,"The Nun II redeems its less-than-divine predecessor, and is packed with plenty of solidly spooky, memorable moments."
rotten,"Choosing what feels lazier is tough: its relentless, telegraphed jumpscare approach to horror or the empty screenwriting that comes without any real purpose, whether as a standalone story or tied to Conjuring lore"
fresh,"It’s fine. It’s rated R, so that’s a start, although I’m not certain how it was deemed so problematic as to deserve the “keep the kids away” rating. There are a few creative deaths, almost elegantly macabre."
rotten,"The Nun II puts a lot of effort into setting up dark and foreboding scenes, but it's all style over substance. This lazy sequel just churns out weak jump scares and tiresome horror clichés about demons and Catholicism. The story has very little suspense."
rotten,"A convoluted, lacklustre retread of The Nun, only with even more ludicrous plotting and severely diminished scare returns."
fresh,"The Nun 2 starts as a tepid follow-up but deviates into a rollicking monster mash as the pace escalates, events intensify, and the story buds into supernatural bedlam..."
rotten,"Scene after scene builds fear and tension, and then a monster appears, and then … not much else, in most cases."
fresh,"The Nun 2 does a freakily effective job of making a little go a long way, building a moody, broody atmosphere of blasphemous menace within a French girls’ boarding school before getting to the Irene-Valak rematch we’ve all been waiting for."
rotten,Nun the wiser. This sequel needs its bad habits exorcised.
rotten,A movie that seems destined to pound a nail into this franchise’s undead coffin.
rotten,"Its many inane moments sound entertaining when you list them all on one page, but they’re so spread out through this movie that the entertainment is usually quite scarce."
fresh,"Thanks to some vicious violence, well-crafted scares, and an exhilarating finale, “The Nun II” is a welcome improvement on the tedious first film."
rotten,The Nun II dials up the fear factor as it takes the “more is more” approach to everything from set pieces to mythology. It makes for a livelier entry that stumbles in its excess and can't capture what made Valak so scary in the first place.
fresh,"Well-constructed, deftly executed scares and a few creative choices that elevate even the more expected frights make this a winner overall."
fresh,"More thriller than outright horror, and all the more intriguing for it. Excellent casting has elevated this chapter of The Conjuring Chronicles, and it's a solid, if unexceptional entry."
rotten,A disappointing sequel that fails to capitalize the fan-favorite Valak character.
fresh,"The Nun II is an effective, gory, and impressively scary addition to the Conjuring universe..."
fresh,"Ultimately, thanks in large part to its smart simplicity and the lead performance of Taissa Farmiga, The Nun II does its job. It scares us. It delights us. It leaves us wanting more, even if it doesn’t quite stick the landing."
rotten,"While The Nun II had some fun moments that will make you jump, it’s weighed down by a weak story with no real stakes. It holds tight to cliched and sometimes cheesy horror tricks that you will be able to spot a mile away."
rotten,The Nun 2 is a massive improvement from its 2018 predecessor but is ultimately hampered by its script and abundance of cheap scares. Valak’s role in the IP is still as confused as ever.
fresh,"The Nun II was able to silence some of the demons of the past and deliver sufficient bumps, jolts, and eerie goats."
fresh,“The Nun II” has some interesting ideas and some thrilling sequences...
fresh,"Notching up his third entry in what I suppose we’re meant to call the CCU, Michael Chaves looks alive, as often, with the set pieces..."
fresh,An entertaining entry in the Conjuring canon that proves there are still whimpers to be wrung from what’s under that wimple.
fresh,"In some respects an improvement on its predecessor, in others not, this is finally one more good-enough if unmemorable entry sure to extend the series’ life in lucrative fashion."
fresh,"If you can stomach roughly an hour of a scary nun with a subpar skincare routine popping her head out of doorways and chasing French people down corridors, there’s a gleefully demented finale waiting for you..."
fresh,"Call it ""Demon movies gonna demon movie."" And so ""The Nun II"" does its thing, efficiently and with lots of jump scares, as Irene and the Defiler go toe to toe."
rotten,"While Valak may be everlasting, I’m unsure how many more abandoned chapels are left to terrorize."
rotten,"When even the makers of the Nun films are losing interest in malevolent nuns, it’s time to start looking for new ways to be scary."
rotten,"It’s a sequel that copies previous Conjurverse entries, lacks discipline, and overstays its welcome like the rough draft of something tighter, trimmed, and better focused."
rotten,"Locked In is exactly what you think it's going to be. The plot is contrived. Predictably, the dialogue is eye-rolling, and the character behaviors are over-the-top. This erotic thriller could ruin your Netflix and chill."
rotten,"Locked In is heavy on plot and light on character, the kind of movie designed to shuttle you from beginning to end before you notice how bored you are."
fresh,"There are elements of gothic fairytale, psychological horror, and illicit revenge thriller, but Locked In ultimately feels like it could have had its tone a little better locked down."
rotten,"The climax is so anti-climactic that twists or no twists, it just leaves the viewer frustrated that we didn’t get a tale of rising suspense, rising stakes and increasing peril instead of the movie they chose to muddle out of this promising premise."
fresh,Locked In is the type of made-for-TV thriller you’d expect to catch on Lifetime on a Friday night. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.
rotten,"Aping the format and tease of a novel that you just can’t bear to put down, Locked In is instead a film you wish you would have stopped far earlier."
rotten,Locked In is yet another bland-as-hell Netflix thriller.
rotten,"Netflix's new franchise-starter, starring Gal Gadot and Alia Bhatt desperately needed some meat."
rotten,"The major problem here is the lack of emotional development for Rachel's character, which takes away the possibility of Gadot becoming a durable action heroine. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"This is a perfectly solid action movie, even if it offers nothing we haven't seen a million times before."
rotten,"Gadot proves she doesn’t need Wonder Woman to kick butt, but the script is too complicated for its own good. Viewers are used to MI6 secret agents, but when there are super secret agents beneath that, it’s hard to keep track of who’s double-crossing who."
fresh,"On the surface, Heart of Stone may come across as just another spy thriller from the saturated genre. But not if one peeks into its heart..."
rotten,"While some action sequences feel new and exciting, the rest of—well— everything else, feels like there was no effort put into them."
fresh,The film's international cast is a big part of its appeal and neatly fits with the storyline's idea of a non-nation-based spy outfit.
fresh,"The problem lies in originality, the lack thereof."
fresh,"Needed another round with the script to polish up its rougher edges and questionable plot choices, but at least the action scenes make it an average enough weekend time killer."
rotten,Will surely be in play for one of the worst films of the year.
rotten,"Heart of Stone, in this instance, is just a disposable product of a highly proposed idea. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The brilliantly-shot action set pieces aside, ‘Heart of Stone’ will disappear into the abyss as yet another forgettable high-budget espionage thriller that splurges on the genre’s opulence."
rotten,There’s neither a palpable physicality to the set-pieces nor a genuine hum to the storytelling.
fresh,"Harper makes a generic action picture, though a very fun one. Heart of Stone is the kind of movie that audiences watch, have a great time, and forget five minutes after the credits roll."
fresh,"Ms. Gadot is magnetic... and is spinning her wheels in the snow of the Alps, the dust of the African desert and the lava sands of Iceland in an effort to place the cornerstone, so to speak, in the construction of yet another kinetic movie series."
rotten,Tom Harper's film could only be more of a Mission Impossible rip-off if it were called Mission Unbelievable.
rotten,"Heart of Stone thus serves a stiff offering of spies and twists who instead of suspense, deal in pure automation."
rotten,"Like far too many Netflix original films, ""Heart of Stone"" is a star studded, big budget, slickly produced mediocre film."
rotten,The slam-bang stuff in this picture is too tediously routine.
rotten,"Heart Of Stone puts star producer Gadot through her paces in a knock-off espionage thriller that is positioned to launch a Netflix franchise. Feel free to say stop, no more, after this uninspiring introductory experience."
rotten,"Heart of Stone starts out decently enough with a big action sequence at a ski resort, but the script goes nowhere new as Stone hops from one exotic location to the next while chases and explosions are thrown in."
rotten,"The inert script, soulless characters and vapid MacGuffin plotline that feels like a twice-flushed Bond idea make this high-production-value tale of intrigue and continual action a joyless thrill ride."
rotten,"It gets the adrenaline pumping, yet the slick and stylish film is more generic between its kinetic set pieces, leaving Gadot’s compelling character in search of a better movie."
rotten,"I will say this though, compared to Red Notice or The Grey Man, which matched the charisma of its stars with the opportunity to be some of the worst-looking $200 million blockbusters one could look at, Heart of Stone at least reads coherently."
rotten,Heart of Stone is a Mission: Impossible wannabe that mostly misses.
rotten,"A bombastic action thriller that feels like a patchwork of bits and pieces recycled from other, better movies."
fresh,"Whew ... it's like folks have never seen an action film before. Standard & redundant after the latest Mission Impossible film, but has legs due to Gadot and Dornan's charms. The action events are decent, yet as always … who is funding these rogue spies?"
rotten,"Generic where it needs to be inventive, and fussy where it needs to be streamlined, new Netflix spy thriller Heart of Stone is like a dry-clean-only article of clothing fresh out of a washing machine."
fresh,"The fact it is real people leaping out of airplanes, or off the top of a cliff, or riding a motorbike down a snowy mountain gives all of the actions an edge that no C.G.I. can match."
rotten,"Despite a surprising twist early on, Heart of Stone features an underwhelming final battle and will ultimately leave you stone-faced."
rotten,Apparently AI has reached the Multiplicity stage where making a copy of a copy starts with loglines of Mission: Impossible films and then tries to capture the banality of Ghosted and casting the least charismatic presence of Red Notice.
rotten,"There is so much going for Heart of Stone, at least in terms of its essential components, that it is a tad surprising and disappointing that one is eventually left with a nagging sense that the film is not quite all that it could have been."
rotten,Will likely have you craving something better the moment those credits roll.
rotten,"Everything is very serious, yet Heart of Stone comes across as an involuntary parody. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Heart of Stone is too cookie-cutter and uninspired... It isn’t even exciting from a kinetic standpoint: bodies and frames careen down slopes and across tight indoor spaces... further diminish[ing] the stakes without injecting a shred of irony.
rotten,"Spy movies are supposed to be built on intrigue but there’s not much of that to be found in Heart of Stone. As a franchise starter, this Gal Gadot action vehicle fails to ignite."
rotten,"""Heart of Stone"" is another bland serving of Europudding... a sloppy, forgettable, and tasteless misfire."
rotten,"Gadot has charisma, she has impeccable nails and her makeup never smears, and yes, she emphasizes the humorous moments, but everything you see is pretty shallow. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Heart of Stone features an interesting idea or two, but the execution is poor. The twists do not feel earned, and the exciting fight choreography is hidden behind bland effects."
rotten,A disposable action film.
fresh,Heart of Stone isn't a game changer. But the Gal Gadot-led Netflix flick does offer a solid enough experience -- bolstered by a strong cast and overall good execution -- to justify a watch.
fresh,"HEART OF STONE seems to be an attempt to launch a new spy thriller franchise and if this is any indication, it just may take off. It checks the boxes of exotic locations, over-the-top stunts, and a plot in which the fate of the world hangs in the balance."
fresh,"Gadot is a pleasure to watch and the supporting cast all chip in. If this is the first in a series of Gal Gadot-led MI-like films, as the producers said when the project was announced, I look forward to the next one."
rotten,"The film comes across has hollow and soulless, and I get enough of those in a given year on the big screen that I don’t need to switch over to a streamer to get one more."
rotten,"The conquer-the-world machinations, the unoriginal action choreography, the blandly-written characters, and the unstoppable formidability of the superspy make it so hard to care about any of it."
rotten,"Heart to Stone progresses into a meandering, padded-out midsection that’s compounded by Harper’s staggeringly bland approach to the material..."
rotten,"“Heart Of Stone” purports to have characters made of gritty, golden, unbreakable stuff, but that’s a tagline, not a movie; it’s really just flimsy work easily tossed off as it tumbles into the ever-filling bin of disposable Netflix movies."
rotten,“Heart of Stone” capitalizes on Gadot’s inherent likability... without bringing enough distinctive elements to this exercise to make it feel like much more than a “Mission” wannabe.
fresh,The screenplay is a rudimentary thing – scaffolding to support the set pieces – that starts to creak whenever it attempts any depth of character. But the action is terrific...
rotten,Heart of Stone is a great movie for your dad to fall asleep watching; not for much else though.
fresh,"With all its flaws, it’s ultimately an entertaining film with some beautiful scenery and a solidly satisfying ending."
fresh,"The entertainment value is there, as is the star power, but the film never quite digs deep enough into any particular element to make an impact. The result is a slick action film that never has, well…heart"
fresh,"There’s a lot to enjoy in “Heart of Stone” if you can kick your feet up, recline back, and toss aside any baked-in preconceptions you may have."
rotten,Shoveling down heaps of nothing like Heart of Stone is like chewing through a mountain of cotton balls.
fresh,"Heart of Stone certainly doesn’t sink, often flying by with excitement, impressive stunt work, and a solid performance from Gal Gadot emphasizing violence and heart"
fresh,"Heart of Stone is a fun-while-it-lasts kind of summer movie, boasting enough action and thrills to keep you occupied."
rotten,"Heart of Stone joins the streamer’s seemingly endless stable of star-driven action films, but it does little to differentiate itself... There’s no big action sequence, or even a single moment that merits any sort of feeling other than déjà vu."
rotten,"Paint-by-numbers plot and action collapses under uninspired writing, painful clichés, and overproduced spectacle."
rotten,None of the dialogue here is worth listening to; it’s just deadass yammering.
rotten,Heart of Stone is a waste of money on things as grandiloquent as they are dramatically unnecessary. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"The success of movies like Heart of Stone lies in the ability to provide uncompromising entertainment while also provoking reflection. In this sense, this one accomplishes its mission... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If you’re just watching Heart of Stone between glances from your phone or as you fold your socks, then it’s reasonable to assume that Gadot is a glamorous movie star... But that’s never really good enough."
rotten,"Gal Gadot accepts a Mission: Impossible-type job in this potboiler action movie, which justifies its title in a groan-worthy style."
rotten,"Gadot gives a great physical performance but is let down by lacklustre writing and directing. Constant, distracting fight scenes annoy, and somehow old-fashioned imagery of future AI can't hold a candle to the scarier real-world implications of AI now"
fresh,Just engaging enough to recommend it.
rotten,"For almost any action in any scene throughout the film, there seems to be someone describing exactly what we’re seeing...it’s so heavy-handed, it feels like the film comes with Cliff Notes."
rotten,Another dump from the giant Netflix Originals factory. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,There's plenty of action to enjoy and intrigue lurking around every corner in Rucka and Schroeder’s story about a secret agent who feels like she doesn’t belong anywhere in the world.
rotten,"Tom Harper tries to hold things together, but when state-of-the-art tracking technology leads to an online chat that seems straight out of the ‘90s-set Sandra Bullock-starrer The Net, it all feels a little too shambolic and cobbled together."
rotten,"Gadot and Dornan are appealing, but this film steals most of its aesthetic and thematic ideas from the Bourne films, which have since been passed by."
rotten,"Heart of Stone becomes overly dependent on increasingly generic, formulaic storytelling, action, and character-building methods, ending up completely devoid of emotion or impactful resolutions."
rotten,"While it does get better as it goes along and offers some solid performances from our main leads and some occasional fun action sequences. This, unfortunately is yet another run of the mill forgettable Netflix action film, you've seen 1000 times."
fresh,Pretty surprisingly fun spy action movie that's really rewatchable.
fresh,"Director Tom Harper (see 2019’s “The Aeronauts”) does a good job staging loads of gunplay, car chases, a James Bond-like parachuting sequence, and all manner of hand-to-hand combat."
fresh,"This is one of the stronger recent Netflix original films to date, at least from the subgenre one might entitle Action Dramas Featuring an A-List Star That Won’t Be Getting an Oscar Push."
rotten,"Heart of Stone is not simply a movie devoid of ideas, it’s a story in active opposition to them."
rotten,This Gadot vehicle has neither a single set piece nor performance to make it worth your time.
rotten,Heart of Stone is a generic action movie held together by Gal Gadot. That comes together thanks to some inventive set pieces and a committed ensemble cast.
rotten,"The film’s vast potential is sabotaged by generic writing.  Despite the considerable charisma of Alia and Gal, Heart of Stone remains strictly average."
rotten,One of the most banal action movies from a Hollywood studio this year.
rotten,"An overly calibrated hodge-podge of better movies with absolutely no original thought of its own, populated by stock characters, and brought to life with uninspired filmmaking."
rotten,"Dumb, but watchable."
rotten,"It's the routine of it all that underwhelms in Heart of Stone, a pretty typical espionage thriller with a few moments and ideas that suggest at least some level of creativity..."
fresh,Heart of Stone is a decent introduction to a potential franchise thanks to a charismatic leading turn from Gal Gadot and some solid action sequences.
rotten,"Netflix's ​​​​​​​Heart of Stone attempts to put its own spin on a familiar action flick and break through that mold, but its results are mixed."
rotten,"Even though “Heart of Stone” follows the basic formula, which can result in a passable spy movie, there is simply too much going on."
fresh,"The movie is fun, which could be all we need right now. Let’s do it again next summer."
fresh,No question Gadot’s presence will mean something here. She brings a level of humanity that lifts the material.
rotten,"Heart of Stone is an ideological mess. AI is great until it’s not, and then it’s fine because Gal Gadot can just kick someone in the face. It’s conflicted without embracing that conflict, resulting in a film that’s really about nothing at all."
rotten,Heart of Stone is a cliche-filled actioner that is sadly missing its ticker. Gadot is the standout but even she can’t pump much life into the anemic script.
rotten,"Heart of Stone opts for broad strokes, which would be a bit more forgivable if the rest of the movie hit the heights it was so clearly aiming for."
rotten,"Heart of Stone works like a dutiful, beaten-down undercover agent, on deep background, while you watch something else on your laptop."
fresh,I’m open to seeing more of Rachel Stone and the Charter save the world. But I’ll also add that I hope to see Gadot stretch beyond action-hero roles. She’s got the talent for it.
rotten,"In a year that has seen some solid action thrillers, ‘Heart of Stone’ pales in comparison."
rotten,"Heart Of Stone is a perfectly watchable and often daft bit of fun, but its mission to supersede Ethan Hunt might prove to be impossible."
rotten,"All the pieces here are fine but nothing is distinct from dozens of films before it. You would swear that the movie’s star AI wrote it — and even gave itself first billing, too."
rotten,"Heart of Stone is a poorly made action. If you want to watch something like Mission Impossible, just watch any of the Mission Impossible films. Why waste your time on a copycat?"
rotten,"What makes Heart of Stone frustrating is the inattention to detail – there’s the core of a story here that might have come off, if screenwriter Greg Rucka (rehashing many problems from The Old Guard) had finessed things more intelligently."
fresh,"This fun, explosion-packed actioner has franchise potential, but is missing a final ace up its sleeve."
rotten,"The film, of course, sets up for a sequel or two, another franchise for the algorithm to chew up, more artificial entertainment to consume, another screen to watch. Next time, we humbly ask, can we get a little more human?"
fresh,"Heart of Stone has been designed, allegedly, to launch a franchise. If this is the first instalment, count me in for the second."
rotten,"For international intrigue to be, you know, intriguing, you first have to care about the characters, and ""Heart of Stone"" skips over that part. It's generic, spy-by-numbers, and you've forgotten most of it by the time the credits roll."
fresh,Efficiently entertaining if you don’t take it too seriously.
rotten,What makes “Heart of Stone” such an enervating experience isn’t that it’s incompetent but that nothing in it matters.
rotten,"Netflix's new franchise-starter, starring Gal Gadot and Alia Bhatt, isn't as terrible as Red Notice or The Gray Man, but that doesn't mean it's much better either."
rotten,"If [Tom] Cruise is trying to save the movies, as he’s often credited with doing, he’s trying to save us from films like this."
fresh,"“Heart of Stone” is better than the usual two-fisted streaming affair, mainly because of Gadot."
fresh,"“Heart of Stone” is clearly intended to jump-start an action franchise for Gadot, and it’s off to a promising start."
rotten,Let’s hope this is not the beginning of a secret-agent franchise.
fresh,"It’s all total nonsense that barely warrants a first think let alone a second, but it’s surprisingly propulsive nonsense, packaged with a studio slickness one wouldn’t expect..."
rotten,"Heart of Stone is below-average spy thriller that acts as a pilot for an action franchise rather than a stand-alone film. The action is uninteresting, predictable, and highly digitized."
rotten,"Tom Harper's Heart of Stone is the sort of generic action movie whose bland, by-the-numbers masala doesn't have an iota of originality in it."
fresh,"Cinematographer George Steel shoots for the big screen, and has an eye for action. The location work gives the movie an up-market sheen, but don’t be fooled, this is an expensive knockoff, a Canal Street copy of other, better spy movies."
rotten,"The formula is tried and true, and the Wonder Woman star packs a punch even if the film itself struggles to set itself apart."
rotten,"[We] get … a world run by super-agents, answerable to seemingly no one, keeping the world safe with the help of an omniscient AI. That sounds like a nightmare, but for Heart of Stone, it’s all peachy. A reckoning is due."
rotten,"Make of it what you will, but 'Heart of Stone' ticks all of the boxes in the exact order you'd expect from a star-powered Netflix action extravaganza."
rotten,"What does it say about ""Heart of Stone"" that the most attention-grabbing moments are entirely derivative of previous ""Mission: Impossible"" films, with several sequences from 2018's ""Fallout"" followed almost to the letter?"
rotten,"Heart Of Stone is zero-gravity filmmaking, the kind of movie that floats along amiably, an amusing two-hour-long flight in which nothing ever seems to land – not the emotions, not the punches, not the twists."
rotten,Heart of Stone is a spy-thriller that uses terribly tired espionage cliches to give us another serviceable action film that has to lead a franchise.
fresh,"Heart of Stone is not at the level of a Bond or Mission Impossible, but it's sufficiently thrilling and action packed to warrant the rising Netflix subscription costs."
rotten,"Braff has not grown as a filmmaker or writer and still believes putting a bunch of indie songs over a scene is enough to make it dramatically coherent. Still, for those who love Florence Pugh, her performance will not disappoint even if the film does."
rotten,"Though Pugh does her customary excellent work here, she’s ultimately undermined by all the overlong, transparently manufactured, and downright whiplash-inducing melodrama around her."
fresh,"Zach Braff’s latest won’t change the screenwriting or filmmaking game one bit, but a pair of solid lead performances made it worth watching. Morgan Freeman helps every movie he's in."
fresh,"The entire cast elevates the heavy-handed, predictable and contrived melodrama, though there are magic human moments that land because of the performers’ skills."
fresh,Zach Braff's direction is solid but his writing is the best aspect of it all as well as Florence Pugh great performance.
fresh,"Director Zach Braff delivers many insightful, poignant scenes about grief, guilt, and how hard it can be to forgive ourselves, even when other people have already forgiven us."
fresh,"There are some undeniably foreboding moments, but thankfully, it wades into darker territory without quickly brightening everything with a cute scenario."
fresh,Touching story about three people who are able to face addiction and grief through their kindnesses to each other.
fresh,"A Good Person is a story of shades of grey that loses itself in its third act, but just as well deserves our attention to attend a display of honesty told by a regretfully insecure hand. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It’s a deeper issue than the stakes of the film not manifesting, there’s something about the clear-eyed presentation of its bleary-eyed characters that seems to signal a quality of inauthenticity."
rotten,A forgettable sentimental melodrama about a family tragedy.   [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Writer/director Zach Braff’s well intentioned but predictable drama A Good Person is saved by another stunning screen performance from Florence Pugh.
fresh,"A Good Person mostly works, thanks to the strength of its performers and its compassionate spirit."
rotten,“A Good Person” veers between moments of genuine feeling and moments of phony schmaltz — and ends up delivering more of the fake stuff than the real thing.
fresh,"After an annoying beginning, A Good Person hits its stride and turns into a movie you definitely should not miss; a meditation on the ravages of opioid addiction, featuring dramatic heavy-hitters Pugh and Freeman. Very heartwarming."
fresh,"The pleasure lies in watching Pugh and Freeman face up and finally come around to one another. It’s not straightforward, a dance of advance and retreat with both revealing their strengths and weaknesses, but it’s always worth watching."
fresh,Every one of these characters is up to their necks in a mother lode of woe that makes perversely compelling viewing.
fresh,"… manages to eke out a good experience off the strength of its visceral lead performances and its eventual, if still rocky, ability to wring proper catharsis out of occasionally screwface-inducing developments."
rotten,The answer to a question no one asked (what would happen if you smushed misery porn into eldersploitation and had Zach Braff do it?)...
fresh,"Pugh gives a mesmerising performance and Freeman, for once cast in a very substantial role, is better than he’s been in several years."
rotten,"A Good Person is well-intentioned and offers admirable, fully committed performances by Pugh and Freeman, but its A Bit Muchness too often derails the train."
rotten,"Overlong, paced horribly, little momentum and cliches about grief, addiction, the opioid crisis and teenage rebellion."
fresh,A Good Person is about a good person involved in a tragic incident and the actions she takes to feel good about herself again. The film is a two hour well intentioned therapy session. It’s about overcoming grief.
rotten,"""A Good Person"" presents all of the wrong optics and feeds into some pretty disgusting stereotypes Hollywood has always produced in how it portrays drug addiction and mental health. And the Bagger Vance vibe is insulting to say the least."
fresh,"Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman elevate this bittersweet story about addiction, grief, and second chances. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,A Good Person is a simple yet complex drama with the intention of bringing some good to this world.
rotten,"Stellar performances by Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman aren’t enough to salvage “A Good Person,” an earnest but heavy-handed, melodramatic multiple redemption story from writer-director Zach Braff."
fresh,"This is a film that belongs to its leads. Pugh gives a visceral portrayal of a young person who has succumbed to addiction, and Freeman is haunting as the sharp-tongued, stern ex-police officer who has a dark past of his own."
fresh,"A Good Person is a slightly above-average character study on grief, with Pugh’s outstanding performance at its center."
fresh,The best narrative film thus far about the opioid impact.
fresh,Writer-director Zach Braff goes dark with the addiction film “A Good Person” featuring compelling performances by Florence Pugh as an opioid addict and Morgan Freeman as a recovering alcoholic. Freeman is terrific and Pugh has never been better.
fresh,There are times when casting really does matter and A Good Person is an excellent example.
fresh,"Though it’s early in the year, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Pugh could snag an Oscar nomination for her performance in A Good Person."
fresh,It's impossible to imagine anyone besides Pugh and Freeman playing the two battered and bruised souls whose fates are intertwined in A Good Person.
fresh,The best reason to see this movie is to watch Pugh. There's no other actor quite like her working in movies at the moment.
fresh,"Braff has a way of making films that hit upon melodramatic angles and syncing it to specific soundtrack choices that can feel grating. With that in mind, this film does feature very strong performances from Pugh and Freeman."
fresh,The film always felt grounded thanks to its central performances from Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman.
rotten,"Pugh has never been better than she is here, utterly immersed in the character’s accent and world-shrinking despair. Freeman lends some flint and fire and sparkle to this simple redemption tale that touches, amuses, overreaches and overstays its welcome."
rotten,The contrived screenplay is the film's downfall.
rotten,Zach Braff presents another competent movie that checks all of the dramatic boxes.
rotten,"This tonally awkward melodrama means well but rarely, if ever, finds its feet."
rotten,"An exploration of grief and addiction that can’t decide if it wants to be grounded or melodramatic and ultimately fails to be either, or much of anything at all."
fresh,Writer-director Zach Braff maintains a lightness even as this becomes a perhaps too-heavy film about a group of wounded people who are trying to get their lives moving in a positive direction after a tragedy.
rotten,... A bizarre mix of gritty drama and slushy nonsense.
rotten,"Featuring Braff’s usual soundtrack of breathy pop-folk tracks, the movie refits personal tragedy as a Tumblr moodboard."
fresh,"A Good Person even has a calculated title, but with Pugh there’s still some heart in there that gets through."
rotten,"The tone is jarring throughout, mostly preachy and po-faced, and built upon several awkwardly overperformed scenes (Lots of “ ‘F*** you!’ ‘No, f*** you!’ ”) that mostly feel like offcuts from an Edward Albee tribute play."
fresh,"""A Good Person"" is a sincere depiction of grief, addiction, forgiveness, accountability, pain and redemption anchored by two strong and moving performances."
rotten,"Having redeemed the rather silly Don’t Worry Darling through sheer charisma, Florence Pugh is once again called upon to bring her magic to otherwise indifferent material."
rotten,A bad movie about unreal people.
fresh,The reason it doesn't become a rambling mess is because Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh are so damn good.
rotten,"It's got its moments, but a very frustrating film overall."
rotten,"Person is just wall-to-wall agony, with Pugh getting the brunt of it."
rotten,"The lengthy whys and wherefores, offered up in another behind-the-camera effort from comic actor-turned director and writer Zach Braff, should be seen and likely judged by others who have not watched dozens of similar recovery dramas previously."
rotten,"It’s all very capital-A acting, with a serious enough subject to justify the emotions on display here, and that’s the kind of movie Braff can comfortably make."
rotten,Pugh has a way of reminding you why a close-up is the single best gift the moving pictures have given us... You don’t blame Braff for wanting to craft a movie around her. But you can blame him for the movie itself that surrounds that performance.
fresh,"A brutal and heartbreaking film, anchored by emotionally devastating performances by Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman, that forces us to confront our grief but also leaves you with an offer of hope."
fresh,"The intimate story is darkly funny and rich, anchored by Pugh’s unsparing and deeply satisfying performance. Out of darkness, Braff finds hope and the potential for connection among unlikely (yet deeply likable) characters."
rotten,"Despite an excellent cast, this melodrama strains to be profound, with heavy-handed sentimentality overshadowing any noble intentions."
rotten,A misfire of a movie that tries to stuff  its two-hour and five-minute running time with more issues than you'd need to stock an eight-part series.
fresh,"A Good Person brings us another amazing performance from Florence Pugh in the midst of a heart-wrenching story about grief, addiction, and finding the will to overcome all of the obstacles life has thrown at you."
fresh,The cinematic chess match between Freeman and Pugh is spectacular to behold together and separately. A Good Person is an intriguing film leaving  one's heart tattered and hopeful for a humanity able to look beyond  indiscretions and see what lurks beneath
rotten,Pugh has been on a roll recently but hits the buffers with this dollop of schmaltz.
rotten,"... The script gestures vaguely at the wider US opioid crisis but, Lord knows, Braff is no social realist. The stuff of addiction and loss is instead sprinkled with cuteness, then smothered with a custard of speeches about us all being works-in-progress."
rotten,"Director Zach Braff had the advantage of recruiting the transcendent Florence Pugh and all time great Morgan Freeman to tell his story. If they couldn't give his film weight, nothing could. Nothing did."
rotten,"If we indeed sympathise with Allison, we experience a lot of typical addict starts-and-stops with her before she ""kicks"" it. If it’s a frustrating experience for this fictional addict, it can be equally frustrating for the audience."
fresh,"You’re not seeing Pugh and Freeman at full strength. Still, even in this half-hopeless effort, they’re as good as it gets."
fresh,"A GOOD PERSON is the sort of grown-up movie that the people who haven’t returned to movie theaters for action or special effects extravaganzas have been hungering,"
fresh,Decidedly forgettable
fresh,"Writer/director Zach Braff anchors the film with tender-hearted, touching performances by Morgan Freeman and Florence Pugh."
rotten,"Unfortunately, Braff is just not a great writer. As a director, he’s worse."
fresh,"[Braff's] dialogue is robust and speakable, and he's helped by a unifying theme: the ubiquity of addiction in modern life."
rotten,"A Good Person adds schmaltz where it does not belong, and instead of observational distance that could further humanize the events Allison and the others are confronting, Braff forces ghastly treacle down the viewer’s throat."
rotten,"A Good Person is about the opioid epidemic, but what it’s really about is the imperfect but earnest ways in which messy people attempt to mend the trajectories of their broken lives."
rotten,[Zach Braff] achieves something accomplished by no other filmmaker to date: he extracts a bad performance from Florence Pugh.
fresh,"A Good Person does occasionally spill over into the realm of the mawkish... But on the whole, it's rooted in truths, it tells a human story and its heart is in the right place. It's a good movie."
fresh,"It’s a haunting slice of real life that will make you think, feel and maybe even want to reach out to your loved ones. As the film vividly shows, they can be gone in a flash."
fresh,"Heartfelt and honest, albeit scattered in places and increasingly strained down the stretch, writer-director Zach Braff’s A Good Person is an effectively familiar look at the dark point where addiction and grief intersect."
rotten,“A Good Person” highlights the director’s inability to deal with heavier material. He punctuates this film’s depressing subject matter with hit-or-miss moments of humor and comedy.
fresh,"There are enough moments of grace and threads that defy the obvious cliche to keep you interested, even if you’re not wholly buying or invested in every character."
fresh,"A Good Person is well-crafted for the most part, with impressive performances but not everything flows seamlessly from one scene to the next."
fresh,"A Good Person’s set-up suggests a deep dive into survivor’s guilt, addiction and, ultimately, forgiveness, but the lack of jagged edges and grit feels more Hallmark than harrowing."
fresh,A Good Person is not perfect...But the feeling the movie offers is realistic and sometimes shattering.
fresh,"Pugh is watchable doing just about anything, including sweating through her shirts as Allison tries to kick her addiction."
fresh,"Florence Pugh gives another magnetic performance in this hard hitting redemption drama, written and directed by Zach Braff. Aided and abetted by Morgan Freeman, an otherwise average melodrama is elevated by two movie stars on top form."
fresh,"Florence Pugh is terrific in this sincere, moving addiction drama."
fresh,[I]t creates an infectious and genuinely touching spirit of good will.
fresh,"It's been a tough few years but as A Good Person and Florence Pugh's stellar performance reminds viewers in its own way, bouncing back may become challenging at times but it's still possible to get back on one's feet."
rotten,Much of the film reads as a crassly manufactured setup for the arc of redemption and healing that follows.
rotten,"The drama is a cluster of scenes with bad dialogue and platitudes instead of actual pathos. The comedy comes in when it’s uncalled for, breaking whatever genuine emotion the actors worked hard to craft."
rotten,"Overlong, maudlin, overstuffed and contrived despite a moving performance by the always-reliable Florence Pugh."
fresh,"For most of the film, I watched with a lump in my throat and tears welling up in my eyes—largely despite my awareness of Braff’s manipulations—because Pugh and Freeman make every dramatic beat more compelling than it might be with other actors."
fresh,"Florence Pugh, Morgan Freeman, and Celeste O'Connor give standout performances in this searing drama about addiction and grief. An unrealistic 'rescue' scene at a party almost ruins the movie. However, most of the film has emotional authenticity."
rotten,"A Good Person looks like it could have been made by any working director in Hollywood. It’s closed-in by precision and a cold professionalism, but does succeed as a vanity project."
fresh,"A Good Person will have audiences crying buckets. Fleeting moments of levity somewhat alleviates heavy themes, but the characters' crushing sadness takes an emotional toll during a long runtime."
fresh,"A powerful story of addiction, forgiveness, and grief anchored by truly remarkable performances from Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman"
fresh,"It’s a tough indie drama, but A Good Person doesn’t wallow in its own tragedy. It beautifully expresses the flaws in human nature and the tangled mess that results from life and death."
fresh,Pugh delivers a superb starring performance that serves to accentuate her growing artistic stature and co-star Morgan Freeman turns in his best work in years after appearing in far too many sub-par vehicles.
fresh,"A work of art such as “A Good Person” cannot be the product of some casual connection. It’s the product of a soul connection, and I hope Braff and Pugh get another chance to work together."
fresh,Zach Braff’s latest feature excels at taking the measure of how people cope with personal tragedy and does so in a vital and engaging way that’s far more invigorating than depressing.
rotten,"Though Pugh valiantly muscles through the melancholy beats of Braff’s melodrama, there are too many other characters and plot threads to allow her to do much besides heave the story forward."
rotten,"The relentless pummel of pathos wants to break our hearts, making the fatal presumption that we were in love from the start, too."
rotten,"It is as if Pugh is having to push her way through narrative waters that threaten to wash away her performance. No matter how she continues to rise to the challenge, the film’s cascading of contrivances drown her out."
fresh,Congrats to Braff for his return with such an undeniably special and daring film.
fresh,"“A Good Person” never becomes unwatchable by any means, as Pugh and Freeman are too intricately invested in the story to stumble alongside the script. Still, it is a shame to see the film settle for “good” when this person could’ve been “great.”"
rotten,A Good Person fails in both writing and direction.
rotten,... The film uses America’s opioid crisis as a backdrop for a neatly packaged redemption saga that’s far too schematic and polished to really reveal much about anything.
fresh,"Well, all prior hangups and skepticism be damned because A Good Person is actually not a bad movie. In fact, it’s quite good, in a head-scratching, mind-boggling sort of way."
rotten,"A Good Person doesn’t manage to find anything new to say about its themes and Braff’s refusal to break free of obvious cliches brings the whole film down. A Good Person is without a doubt elevated by Pugh’s performance, but that can only save so much."
fresh,"Raw, emotional yet touching, and melancholic, A Good Person film soars on its two lead performances, and while there are a few bumps, it’s one of 2023's brightest early sparks."
fresh,"Although it sometimes feels like a first film with certain choices and edits, A Good Person is an altogether poignant, emotional & thoughtful drama."
fresh,"Led by two solid performances by Pugh and Freeman, A Good Person shows growth from Braff as both a writer and director, as he attempts to push himself into a more mature story that we’re used to from him."
rotten,"In due course, Braff’s toughest, messiest movie spins out of his control."
fresh,"Despite a number of character choices which defy credibility, “A Good Person” is an honest portrayal of grief, addiction, forgiveness and accepting personal responsibility and Braff’s best film to date...Pugh has delivered for him in spades"
rotten,"The intentions of the movie are clear and admirable, but the execution of ""A Good Person,"" in the end, misses the mark."
fresh,"A Good Person sees Zach Braff's filmmaking take on a heartbreaking and moving new dimension, with ace performances from Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman. I loved it."
rotten,"The more that Zach Braff’s script tries to thematically tie its disparate threads together, the more that A Good Person comes to resemble the very same type of neat and tidy self-contained version of reality that it ironically skewers in its prologue."
rotten,"In his dual capacity as writer and director, Zach Braff here puts us through an ordeal of excruciating contrived nonsense: a masturbatory Calvary of ersatz empathy and emotional wellness."
fresh,"Storytelling is sacrificed for spectacle, resulting in something breathtakingly epic yet partially unsatisfying and unfortunately forgettable."
fresh,"The ballistic bloodletting of the battle for Jerusalem is indeed awe-inspiring, but Scott also finds some space inside such heavy, hellish traffic to humanise the conflict."
rotten,"Even with the addition of 45 minutes of new footage, Sir Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven remains a rather uneventful epic with a story that fails to engage."
rotten,"Cinema's least potent leading man, Orlando Bloom, stinks up the screen in Ridley Scott's unsatisfying ""epic"" about the Crusades..."
rotten,Just another sword and sandal epic...
fresh,Kingdom of Heaven is profoundly relevant for our troubled times.
rotten,"The miscasting of the lightweight Bloom proves fatal: instead of galvanizing this epic, he sucks the energy out of it."
rotten,
fresh,"... an extraordinary work of art, a plea for religious tolerance that works because of sheer filmmaking prowess and good, old-fashioned storytelling. (Director's Cut)"
rotten,One of the more violent films in recent memory. But maybe the violence serves a purpose-it keeps your mind off the inanities of the plot.
rotten,quick review in Greek
fresh,"Kingdom inevitably invites comparisons to Gladiator, Scott's last major epic. But it is a better film, partly because it does less violence to the history."
rotten,Kingdom of Heaven has little going for it outside of its lavish and gory battle sequences.
fresh,"...the movie survives its lackluster star and cluttered plot, thanks largely to director Ridley Scott, who makes most of the goings-on fun while we're sitting through them."
rotten,"There's an audience for ""Kingdom of Heaven"" it's just difficult to know where to find them."
fresh,"Kingdom of Heaven isn't quite the next Gladiator with a fair share of boring moments, but it tries hard"
fresh,"In the end, Bloom shows promise, Scott's work still impresses, and the epic film lives to fight another day."
rotten,
fresh,"Any film daring to touch upon the rivalry of the children of Abraham deserves to be appreciated for its candor & for its delicacy. Plus, come on, it's Ridley Scott."
rotten,dives into the middle of a political-religious morass and still manages to avoid any significant implications
rotten,Where have all the world conquerors gone?
rotten,"Most of the actors have elected to play their knights like crotchety Western gunslingers, a bizarre choice that blows a good deal of fresh air into the stuffy pageantry."
rotten,Ridley Scott shies from addressing faith.
rotten,
rotten,"So much attention has been spent on making a big, lavish piece of Oscar bait that the soul of the movie is completely ripped out."
rotten,"""Kingdom of Heaven"" isn't what I'd been praying for from Ridley Scott."
fresh,"... Flawed, but Scott is such an accomplished filmmaker that he is still able to shape it into an entertaining picture."
rotten,"Once Liam Neeson's noble knight Godfrey exits, Orlando Bloom's lightweight Balian can't carry this message-heavy lecture."
fresh,... director Ridley Scott has proven once again that with a decent script the battle epic does have a place in modern times ...
rotten,"I'm going medieval. As a leading man, Bloom is doomed."
rotten,"a film that tries to be something special, but ultimately fails because of an over-padded script and too many poorly-cast actors."
rotten,"A sanitized version that celebrates a surrender. Saladin never mentions Allah. It's not religion, but economy that drove 8 Crusades across two hundred years?"
rotten,Hopelessly naive ... The final impression is that a few bad apples were all that prevented the Christians and Muslims from joining hands and participating in sing-alongs.
rotten,"The movie flirts with ideas and then runs away from them, so ultimately, it's not much more than a dishonest, spectacular bore."
rotten,
fresh,"When he's surrounded by his men of brawn and battle experience, does Bloom look like the guy they're going to follow?"
fresh,"Scott's visual style and knack for epic storytelling carries us through, and makes his latest work passable, if not memorable, oversized entertainment."
rotten,"Kingdom of Heaven, at nearly 2 1/2 hours, fails to really hold your attention. You drift off at times, waiting for something to happen."
fresh,"Monahan ... gives us glimpses of ways in which Christ's teachings have been distorted, exploited, and misinterpreted. But the film's idea of a better way falls short."
rotten,"Scott has certainly uncovered a fascinating era, but not necessarily the right hero to do it justice."
rotten,It feels spectacularly empty.
fresh,"It all sounds juicy, but Bloom is sadly not up to the task at hand."
rotten,All lecture and no humanity.
rotten,...may be the first hippie war film.
fresh,"Even though it is a long film, it feels compact. The characters are well-defined. The action scenes are well-staged."
rotten,Bloom's listless performance dooms the film. Where is Russell Crowe when you need him?
fresh,"Scott cares more about getting across an ideal of religious tolerance than recounting history - which is, in the long run, perfectly OK"
rotten,"Ultimately, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN can't change actual history. So instead, everyone has to grow a conscience...even the Crusaders have to feel bad about the Crusading."
rotten,"Kingdom of Heaven has at its center a bold story, and yet it sits there like a stone pillar."
rotten,"From watching the film, it's a bit hard to care who conquers."
fresh,Fantastic battle scenes compensate for the lack of emotional depth.
fresh,A far-reaching period epic that is also relevant to our understanding of the conflicts in the Middle East of the present day.
fresh,"With Kingdom of Heaven, Ridley proves that good cinema cannot wait for terrorism."
rotten,"Generic battles, typical actioner."
rotten,"A dreary, uninformative, emotionless disaster. At least Alexander had the comical benefit of Angelina Jolie hamming it up with reptiles."
rotten,"If the intriguing but ultimately derivative Kingdom of Heaven had arrived before these recent period epics, it may have stood a better chance of enthralling us."
fresh,"This Kingdom would truly rule with a Crowe or Gibson, not a middleweight like Orlando Bloom"
fresh,"It is a deeply personal, highly introspective work of artistic expression the likes of which the director hasn't attempted since Blade Runner, this easily his best, and probably least accessible, film since that ground-breaking sci-fi classic."
rotten,"Neeson plays yet another mentor (really, it's actually getting silly now) and, as usual, walks off with the entire thing - the film suffers considerably once he carks it."
rotten,"Kingdom of Heaven looks good, but there's not much there there."
rotten,"Makes for a pretty good summer action-adventure movie, if nothing else"
fresh,Uma das grandes virtudes de Cruzada reside na forma imparcial com que retrata os dois lados do conflito.
fresh,"... we can see the rising tide of history and admire the skillful way it's depicted. But, somehow, that tide never builds enough power to sweep us away."
rotten,"As Balian and his people withstand the might of Saladin's fiery projectiles, siege towers and the usual computer-generated swarm of soldiers, it's hard not to think we're really watching The Lord of the Rings IV: Legolas Defends Jerusalem."
fresh,Is Orlando Bloom enough of a star to sustain a $100 million costume drama? The answer turns out to be yes.
rotten,"Since we barely know what's at stake -- we're too confused and bored to care -- all this fighting means nothing to us, and yet Scott still hopes to rev us up with it."
rotten,Considerably more ambitious and significantly less satisfying than Gladiator.
rotten,"Scott's skill at handling of action sequences is thrilling, but Bloom lacks the gravity and raw charisma his role demands and robs the film of narrative urgency."
rotten,An epic about Christian crusaders who happen to be liberal humanists willing to die for the sake of religious tolerance. That's just ... weird.
rotten,Mostly uninvolving; a movie you admire for its craft rather than enjoying for its passion.
fresh,"To say that Scott did a beautiful job directing Kingdom of Heaven would be true, but it wouldn't convey the nature of the achievement."
fresh,Knights! Castles! Broadswords! Catapults! Flaming balls! Severed heads! Burning oil! Gushing digital blood!
rotten,What we are left with are beautifully choreographed fight scenes of massive scale and moderate interest.
fresh,Scott creates an exotic yet real world and gives it epic scope and potent dramatic power.
rotten,Scores a few points for its positive portrait of Muslims in the time of the Crusades.
fresh,"The closing battle scenes are realistic and exciting, and noteworthy for the seamless mixing of live-action and special effects. Jerusalem is one of the first recreated ancient citadels to look real on screen."
rotten,The prescription for cooling today's cross-cultural antipathies is as respectable as it is obvious.
fresh,"Scott's battles are ferocious things of grim beauty -- bloody, personal and deafening crashes of armored men and horses colliding at full gallop."
rotten,Ridley Scott's breathtaking historical epic is let down by patchy script.
rotten,Yawn. Are the Crusades over yet? Wake me when it's time to leave.
fresh,"The textures are rich, the color scheme varied, the action sequences visceral. There is barely a frame in which you don't feel the touch of his strong hand."
fresh,"The battle sequences here are actually worth the cost of admission, and there is exemplary supporting work by Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton and especially Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud as the legendary Muslim leader Saladin."
rotten,The religious sentiment accumulates into a tower of politically correct Jell-O.
rotten,"Filmed in Morocco, in Spain and in computers, Kingdom fills a vast canvas with breathtaking spectacle. In contrast, most of the performances are blandly ordinary."
fresh,"The somber Kingdom may not provide an epic's anticipated escapism, but it serves as a salient reminder that hundreds of years later these battles are still being waged."
fresh,"If the picture isn't as engaging as it should have been, Scott's images still make it entrancing."
rotten,Another in a recent line of sword-swinging epics that insists on adding ideas to bloody spectacle.
rotten,It's just a bunch of arguing with dirty people who look like they stepped out of a two-bit Renaissance Festival.
rotten,Scott once again proves himself an inept director of action.
fresh,"The movie is distinguished by the uniform excellence of its actors ... Orlando Bloom, in particular ... gives a performance of striking stillness and reserve ..."
rotten,"What it means in terms of neat, bloody storytelling is that a revenge tale (Gladiator avenges dead wife and child) makes a much neater package than [this]."
fresh,This is one cool movie!
fresh,"a sad reminder that the distrust, misunderstandings and misconceptions that have marred relations between the Eastern and Western worlds are nothing new..."
fresh,"A $130 million epic with much to marvel at and great battle scenes, but it dazzles the senses while barely touching the heart."
rotten,"No one should be offended except, of course, those who like movies that excite the mind as well as the pulse."
rotten,"Dramatically, the problem is it's a lot easier to root for someone battling tigers and gladiators than it is to cheer on a guy wondering about the meaning of life. This is why Waiting for Godot has never been made into a summer movie blockbuster."
rotten,"Kingdom of Heaven has the nasty habit of quickly killing off its most interesting and compelling characters, those in whom the film invests time and tries to develop."
fresh,"Scott's interesting but uneven effort doesn't disappoint when it comes to the siege of Jerusalem, which has scale and a truly frightening quality."
fresh,"Never straying from issues of war and peace, organized religion and an individual's relationship to God, Kingdom of Heaven earns the right to rattle its swords."
fresh,"A war story that takes no sides because it takes all sides. And it's a period piece, set in the last decades of the 12th century after Christ, that resonates in a thoughtful way today."
rotten,Is this the worst Hollywood festive rom-com ever made?
fresh,"Thanks to a satisfying performance by Witherspoon and Vaughn's dependable comic chops, Four Christmases is a modestly entertaining holiday film for the entire family."
rotten,A tried and true formula that's like a repackaged Christmas gift; it's sort of comforting in its predictability but totally lacking in solid film form and originality.
rotten,About as predictable as socks under the tree.
rotten,
rotten,
fresh,It's too sparse in the comedy to be really successful--every good joke is in the commercials--but it's got some heart and that counts for something.
rotten,"Maybe if Four Christmases had extended itself beyond white trash targets and projectile vomiting, we could've been talking about a new Christmas classic right now."
rotten,"Movie-goers heading to see the romantic comedy Four Christmases might want comedy, Christmas cheer and chemistry, but nobody gets everything on his wish list."
rotten,How many Academy Award winners can a studio put in one cast and still turn out a bad movie?
fresh,"Although not a yuletide classic, Four Christmases is better than most of the holiday-oriented slop put out in recent years."
rotten,"For all of its snarky holiday/family bashing, Four Christmases wimps out in the third act and reaffirms all the traditional values it affects to mock."
rotten,Maybe catch one of the other hundred holiday films to be offered over the next few weeks and wait for Four Christmases to come to your local Red Box.
rotten,Grows tired long before the end credits start rolling at the 80-minute mark.
rotten,"There is no spark to the humor, there is no warmth to the drama. There is a tired plot that whips the essence of every Christmas movie ever made into a dreary slog"
fresh,"Feels like they wanted to make 5 different holiday movies and couldn't decide which plot line was best, so they rolled them all together, glossing over everything."
rotten,Projectile baby vomiting is a recurring gag. I cried mistletoe well before the film was halfway through.
rotten,Feels both too cluttered and too safe.
fresh,"This is marginally better than most, with a few offbeat comic ideas, a reliably droll performance from Vaughn, and, as the parents, four watchable old troupers in search of a fat paycheck."
fresh,You can see most of the big slapstick set-pieces looming long before they hit but there are a few smaller routines that pack a punch just because they have an unexpectedly manic tilt to them.
rotten,An embarassment for all involved.
rotten,"Four Christmases boasts one of the most impressive casts ever assembled to make a movie that is, at best, only mildly amusing."
fresh,A good start to the holiday season.
rotten,"Filled with 'hilarious' scenes of people being vomited on and falling off roofs, Four Holidays tries to meld nasty, black-hued comedy with warm sentiment, resulting in a sick melange of treacle and malice."
rotten,"An imperfect storm of horrible writing, awkward casting and questionable taste gathers soon after the opening credits and dumps downpours of buzz-killing humour at depressingly regular intervals."
rotten,"There are worse holiday-related ways to spend your time than Four Christmases, I suppose. Making a three-hour drive to grandmother's house in pea-soup fog, for one."
rotten,"Four Christmases is the kind of film that you should only watch if you're trapped on an airline and can't fall asleep, the kind of holiday film that makes Jingle All the Way look like a cinematic tour de force."
rotten,"So monstrously awful that it will probably make a fortune, spawn sequels and cause a mania for gags involving projectile-vomiting babies."
rotten,"Witherspoon and Vaughn play two characters who are totally unlikeable, and the movie as a whole is too."
rotten,"Gordon's stars are charmless, his script cheerless, and his sterling supporting cast can't seem to figure out what they've been brought on board to do."
rotten,Didn't quite get over the hump.
rotten,"Oh, the hilarity of hating your family at the holidays."
rotten,"Even apart from the retarded and retread contrivances that provide context for their argument, Four Christmases is intensely disturbing in its class politics."
rotten,"Vaughn and Witherspoon are plainly uncomfortable in their roles,... two of the flattest performances of any romantic comedy of recent vintage."
rotten,"Proving that quantity does not equal quality, director Seth Gordon (The King of Kong) presents Four Christmases, a weak, soulless holiday film in spite of its inclusion of five previous Oscar winners."
rotten,"A top cast just manages to keep Four Holidays afloat but the script offers too few laughs, and slapstick turns to schmaltz before we've had enough Christmas Cheer."
rotten,...lowbrow humor that fails to delight.
fresh,"I hope I meet a girl who can keep up with me like Reese Witherspoon. Not a blonde though. Sorry, not my type."
fresh,"Despite a horrible trailer that seems designed to keep people away, this is an entertaining movie with good performances by Vaughn and Witherspoon."
rotten,"Letting the hulking Vince Vaughn near a Christmas movie is just like giving a knife to your crazy drunken uncle during a seasonal family gathering--it's reckless, pointless and ultimately foolish in concept."
rotten,"Although the list is rather short, maybe Vince Vaughn should think about throwing in the towel when it comes to starring in movies that deal with some aspect of Christmas."
rotten,"Vince Vaughn tries his best at ab-libbing his way through the film, but Witherspoon seems to have no clue what she's doing. If you're desperate for a Christmas comedy, rent SURVIVING CHRISTMAS instead."
rotten,"Witherspoon works hard to convince us otherwise, but this is a miscast mess. Definitely a turkey rather than a Christmas pudding."
fresh,"Even with the clich and rushed ending, the flick survives on its clever dialogue that made me laugh out loud a dozen times."
rotten,"The mix of gross-out gags, slapstick and saccharine sentiment should boost the sale of indigestion tablets this festive season."
rotten,"These embarrassing truths, indeed the entire film, take a great deal of hard swallowing. The mawkish ending is thoroughly predictable. But it's not quite as ghastly as the ingredients might suggest."
rotten,"In this egregious Christmas movie, Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon each demonstrate the classic ""Hollywood romcom"" face: waxy as a corpse, dead-eyed with self-loathing."
rotten,Seeing such talent wasted on this dross is dismaying.
rotten,"But as syrup and cynicism congeal into one painful clot, there is never any doubt that this is a major studio's crack at the Yuletide market."
rotten,"Witherspoon and Vaughn are physically ill-matched. She has never looked tinier, while the always gigantic Vaughn has put on so much weight that I half-expected the big plot revelation to be that he'd eaten her twin sister."
fresh,This bit of festive froth is nothing original but it delivers enough moments to make you smile.
rotten,A laboured romp.
rotten,"A fabulous cast is thrown away on forced gags; still, by the genre's standards the message is interestingly complex and ambivalent - pro-family, naturally, but with such qualifications that you almost feel it's sincere."
rotten,It feels like a long slog toward a half-baked ending that wants to have its sugary Christmas cake and eat it.
rotten,Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play the leads. Do they convince as lawyers or lovers? No. Do they convince as space aliens trying to infiltrate the human race? Yes.
fresh,"Average family comedy that's saved by likeable performances from Vaughn and Witherspoon, though it bungles its emotional finale and feels a little flat as a result."
fresh,This film is too fragmented to ever come together. Although terrific actors and some serious subtext make it enjoyable.
rotten,"Seems intent on being as generic and lowbrow as possible, with broad slapstick emphasized over witty dialogue or interesting characters."
rotten,"Director Seth Gordon's debut feature is a mutant meringue of a movie, with the sugar icing oddly squashed beneath the bitter lemon filling curdling on top. The result is an unpleasant goo that's neither sweet nor sour."
rotten,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon can't bring this Yuletide comedy home, but without their chemistry and respective personalities it would be dire."
rotten,What a horrible little movie.
rotten,"Witherspoon and Vaughn, for their part, fail to exhibit any sign that they met before shooting day -- let alone are playing characters who have dated for three years."
fresh,"The trailer focuses almost exclusively on broad, physical comedy sure to draw the yahoo crowd but not necessarily anyone else. A more representative trailer, on the other hand, would have revealed a movie that's actually worth seeing."
fresh,"We've enjoyed their cocky selfishness; just as much, we bask in schadenfreude when they get guilted into making the familial trail of tears."
fresh,The film is not a memorable Christmas present for viewers. But it's no lump of coal either. It's passable entertainment with just enough good laughs to make it worthwhile.
rotten,Four Christmases is two Christmases too many. Two I could survive. But four of them? Nah. Call me Scrooge. Bah humbug.
rotten,"Delightful apart but deadly together, Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn look, throughout Four Christmases, as if they just want to get this thing over with."
fresh,"Four Christmases is a fun and fascinating -- if ultimately featherweight -- comedy not only for the whole family, but for every kind of them."
fresh,"Four Christmases is refreshingly tart and lean, forgoing the usual schmaltz and syrup of the season."
rotten,The difference between the average unfunny comedy and this one is the difference between Grandpa telling you knock-knock jokes and Grandpa telling you knock-knock jokes with his bathrobe open as his hand creeps up your thigh.
rotten,Think of it as fun tear-away wrapping on what's essentially a boring pair of socks.
fresh,"Vaughn and Witherspoon are clearly having a lot of fun snapping each other's synapses, and their sense of play gives the whole easygoing, formulaic enterprise a welcome jolt."
rotten,"Four Christmases generates some laughs here and there, but it's wildly uneven, and too often sets aside the generous gifts of a pretty good cast in favor of cheesy slapstick."
fresh,"The cynicism may not hold up as we get closer to the holiday itself, but with a little distance between us and the reason for the season, they did make me laugh."
fresh,"It's Four Christmases in need of a wedding, or maybe a funeral."
fresh,There's always the underlying feeling that what you're seeing is eerily familiar.
fresh,Holiday romcom is amiable but centers on family dysfunction.
rotten,One and a half Christmases is about all that's worth celebrating in Four Christmases.
rotten,"To brand, then dismiss, Four Christmases as a disappointment would be giving it too much credit -- never, for a second, did this New Line Cinema cast-off scream or even whisper decent in the run-up to its opening."
rotten,"To earn a more helpful R rating, the filmmakers should have gone ahead and dropped a couple of F-bombs alongside the references to 'street whores,' nipples, senior sex and vomit."
fresh,"Very funny, very touching, and very real, and it's not too hard to believe that, though it might not be remembered as a classic, it'll become a holiday favorite for many."
rotten,Several maraschino cherries short of a fruitcake.
rotten,"Here's a clue for people who make movies like Four Christmases: if your holiday season is that awful, keep it to yourself."
rotten,"As impressive as that is, by and large this wannabe yuletide romantic comedy has about as many yucks and guffaws as a swift kick to the head by a steel-toed boot."
rotten,A sequence in which they dress up as Mary and Joseph for a Nativity play is genuinely funny. The rest of Four Christmases doesn't do them justice.
rotten,"Vaughn may, in fact, be the best possible representative of our over-caffeinated age -- rambling, reckless, selfish and yet still somehow awesome -- and he's what makes Four Christmases as barely watchable as it is."
rotten,"Of the movie's misaligned stars, it's Vaughn who emerges the least damaged."
rotten,"Ho, ho, ho? No, no, no."
rotten,Do these hypocritical holiday comedies have an alarm clock inside them that goes off when they're suddenly supposed to turn all soft and gooey?
rotten,"This being a Christmas comedy of sorts, it demands a happy ending of sorts. And a moral too."

rotten,That's funny?
fresh,ideal for anyone who thinks their family is the most dysfunctional during the holidays and yearns to be proved wrong
fresh,Surprisingly deft and sometimes hilarious.
rotten,"When will filmmakers learn that if you start with Bad Santa and finish with It's a Wonderful Life, you just end up with curdled eggnog?"
rotten,No yuletide season would be complete without the crappy Christmas movie.
rotten,A star-studded cast way too talented for the material plod through a painfully rote holiday rom-com.
rotten,"The acrid, wince-worthy Four Christmases may well be part of the war on Christmas Bill O'Reilly's always fog-horning about. Christmas and Christianity will survive it. But barely."
rotten,Use parental caution when opening this early holiday present.
rotten,"Flailing like a dying fish out of water and eventually smelling just as fetid, Four Christmases is stiflingly unfunny."
rotten,To say that Vaughn is phoning it in these days would be an insult to telecommuters everywhere.
fresh,"Vaughn has little romantic rapport with Witherspoon, so the love story has no pull, but Vaughn is in top center-of-attention form and Witherspoon is a game straightwoman."
rotten,"The nonsensical result of shoehorning the same damn message into every 'holiday' movie, year after year."
rotten,"If you liked ""McCain-Palin 2008,"" you'll love ""Four Christmases."""
fresh,"It certainly won't be your favorite present under the tree this Christmas, but it should provide just the diversion you're looking for."
rotten,I am starting to think Vince Vaughn hates Christmas and will not stop making bad Christmas movies until he has ruined the holiday for everyone on the planet.
rotten,...generally comes off as an interminable would-be comedy that'll leave most viewers feeling like the Grinch.
rotten,"One more overstuffed turkey of a movie trying to draw laughs with barfing babies, bratty children, embarrassing revelations, and old people talking about sex."
rotten,"By the time Jon Voight actually utters the line, 'There's nothing more important than family,' whatever subversive spark Four Christmases ever had has gone out the window, replaced by Hallmark Channel schmaltz."
rotten,Four Christmases is simply all-too-familiar and exceedingly mediocre - and will likely be forgotten by the time we take down our Christmas trees.
fresh,"Before a single joke is told, Seth Gordon's Four Christmases earns a positive grade for its inspired casting."
rotten,"""Four Christmases,"" like its four screenwriters, are three too many. Considering what's been left on screen, it is downright horrifying to contemplate the trimmings."
rotten,... stumbles awkwardly through the slapstick parade of brotherly body slams and sneaky kids and babies spitting up all over the maternally tone-deaf Kate...
rotten,"In the end, a musty procreation moral is left to push forth this flimsy plot -- and that's neither original nor particularly funny."
rotten,"As when its self-centered characters tell some children that there is no Santa Claus, the cynical Four Christmases spoils the holiday for all of us."
rotten,"Must everyone make a Christmas film every year? Must it be the same story over and over again? This is why we have the Hallmark Channel. Listen, if your film is not Elf or Bad Santa, I've seen it."
rotten,"The result is two bad movies in one: a gimmicky romantic comedy, and one of those seasonal headaches that submits loud family dysfunction as a vehicle for Christmas cheer."
fresh,"It's four home-for-the-holidays comedies in one, and the variety-pack structure works for the movie: Each nightmare household has a wacked flavor all its own, and none wears out its welcome."
fresh,"A holiday comedy that goes down with ease, avoids insulting one's intelligence, and doesn't leave you wanting to shoot your eye out with a Red Ryder."
rotten,"Bullet Train’s driving engine quickly loses steam. Its runtime is never justified, especially when it chooses to prioritize odd tangents over cogent and streamlined storytelling."
fresh,"Bullet Train is bombastic and silly, but it rarely pretends to be anything else. Is it a great movie? No, not by any stretch. Is it a fun movie? Yes, but like the rails, the bullet train goes off, mileage really may vary."
fresh,"And let's just say with all these stunts, gore and adrenaline-inducing sequences, it is hard to be bored."
rotten,"As it poorly emulates Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, the action picture ends up as a cartoonish mess and exhausting watch more than an entertaining popcorn flick."
fresh,Bullet Train employs David Leitch's maximalist style in a purposefully silly narrative driven by frenetic action and distinct humor. Every second with Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry is genuinely hilarious.
fresh,"AWESOME. The last big ride for the summer that brought back the movie theater experience for so many people & what a film to end on. Widely entertaining from top to bottom that constantly gives you laughs, action, & insanity."
fresh,"Bullet Train is turbulent and chaotic but a thrilling ride nonetheless. Its illogical, blood-soaked premise may derail some, but others might find charm in its memorable cameos, wild hairstyles, and magnetic characters."
rotten,Watching Brad Pitt completely flanderize into a human golden retriever who only recites self-help sayings for 2 hours and 6 minutes was insufferable.
rotten,Bullet Train isn’t going anywhere fast. It’s self-indulgent and thinks it’s doing something entirely unique. The film gives itself far more credit than it deserves.
rotten,I used “annoyingly fun” to describe Bullet Train because I don’t know what other oxymoron can best capture the delirium that transpired in its two-hour runtime.
rotten,"It’s a waste of an interesting premise, it drags after the first act, continues to hit new levels of monotony, and, ironically, never picks up the pace."
fresh,"Bullet Train is a mixed bag, worth seeing for action fans, but maybe at a matinee screening or when it hits VOD. There’s a tighter and better 100-minute movie in that 126-minute high-energy extravaganza..."
fresh,"With an A-list cast happily playing against type, a nonlinear storytelling approach, witty dialogue and a plethora of creative violence, Bullet Train plays out like an immensely satisfying upgrade of prime Tarantino."
fresh,A blast... The film works because Brad Pitt is a really funny and engaging guy.
fresh,"Leitch helms his action with clarity and impact, creating a beautifully nonsensical thrill ride that could have been a trainwreck, but entertains to the end of the line."
fresh,"If Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is wagyu steak, this is a juicy dive burger."
fresh,"Strangely, this murder at 320kms per hour action comedy may be an embarrassment of riches in the talent department, but the execution leaves one exhausted by the trip, impatient to find their stop."
rotten,"Without ebbs or flows to modulate the viewing experience and a never-ending barrage of increasingly ridiculous action (fun at first; exhausting by the end), Bullet Train proves that sometimes “more” is actually too much."
rotten,"Like the titular mode of transportation, it does pick up speed as it barrels along."
rotten,"Brad Pitt's comedic chops are what saves an otherwise exhausting Bullet Train. It is Pitt's incredible comedic deliveries and charisma that carry the film. He proves that, even with a poor script, he has the talent to keep the film on track."
fresh,"With unpredictable intersecting storylines, innovative fight sequences, and a memorable cast of characters, Bullet Train is that rare action flick that doesn't skimp when it comes to delivering in the important areas that are often neglected in the genre."
rotten,"If Brad Pitt's remaining performances are numbered, I would hate like hell to think of what we missed just so that we could have this."
rotten,Not even its sensational cast can save this mildly entertaining train ride from derailment. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"It’s not fatal that Leitch and company have no evident goal other than to amuse audiences with two hours of spiffy nonsense, but there’s a whiff of try-hard desperation behind the film’s bravado."
rotten,"...a relentlessly frenetic (and utterly exhausting) actioner that’s rarely, if ever, as exciting as one might’ve anticipated..."
fresh,"Is the movie trying to say something here? Something about the cruel, farcical hand of fate? Nah. But it is trying to say something: Shut up and enjoy this."
rotten,"It's supposed to Tarantino-esque, and cute, and Antoine Fuqua-riveting-action-y, and hilarious, but it's just none of the above. Miss this train."
rotten,"As an action comedy, it borrows a handful of Ritchie clichés and mixes them conventionally into a violent plot that stumbles unsurprisingly along the rails of chaos and boredom. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Bullet Train is an entertaining high-octane thriller ... is guaranteed to be memorable to audiences
fresh,"Fantasies of crime, especially unruly ones, often have ideas of order and control at their heart, a reach of power we rarely have in ordinary existence."
rotten,"It's a shortcoming when a film set on a highspeed train seems to take no strategic visual approach to presenting that velocity onscreen. ""Bullet Train"" is not lazy enough to be 'by the numbers', but it never feels aesthetically thought out or engaging."
rotten,"Unlike the best action-comedies, there is nothing breezy or light about the film; rather, it runs hard and heavy, constantly trying to impress you with its bloody mayhem."
rotten,"The film needed more of that rebellious yet natural energy instead of the “he killed my wife, I’m mad about that” vengeance diet. What could have been pretty cool ended up being very dull and forgettable."
rotten,"It’s a shame that the filmmakers didn’t trust the spatial and dramatic tensions provided by the train journey, and opted instead for seen-it-all-before spectacle."
fresh,"Not as clever and funny as it thinks it is, but the stylish action comedy is always stimulating and amusing."
fresh,"A lot of fun to watch, while the talented cast fully leans into the colorful cast of characters they’re given to work with. It’s outlandish, a little hard to believe at times, and over-the-top in a way that never falls into full blown camp."
fresh,"It’s just funny enough, just star-powered enough, just well-choreographed enough to squeak by its own shortcomings."
fresh,Bullet Train is a completely zany yet butt-kicking good time film with a fun story.
fresh,"It didn't blow me away, but I was entertained."
fresh,"Bullet Train is an exceptionally fun trip to the cinemas. Pitt gives a downright hilarious performance, reaffirming that he is one of the greats, while Henry and Taylor-Johnson give him a run for his money as the best of the film’s cast."
fresh,"Bullet Train is too cartoonish for much to be at stake and piles on the effects-heavy carnage in its final throes. Luckily, Pitt's delivery just about keeps it on track."
fresh,It delivers nothing we haven't seen before. Yet it succeeds on charisma and energy alone.
rotten,"I ended up asking myself what was more vexing in this film: the allusions to popular culture, the crass hypocrisy of an overworked plot, or the phony action sequences."
fresh,Bullet Train offers a lot to like and leaves something to be desired at the same time.
fresh,"It moves at a good pace, it is full of charismatic performances, and it is always ready to include more violence and blood and one-liners to distract the viewer. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"We're left with a movie that doesn't bother with logic and that believes piling on more stylized action, more shallow humor, and a few cheap cameos is enough to get by."
rotten,"While Bullet Train’s basic premise is a recipe for fun and does succeed in entertaining with pleasing action choreography, it’s never as clever as it thinks it is nor as exhilarating as it ought to be."
fresh,"Leaves a lot on the table with this concept, but no one can pull off a bucket hat like Brad Pitt."
fresh,"The twisty, more-smug-than-clever plot doesn’t really matter, the fun and the guns and the odd celebrity cameo and gruesome death do."
fresh,"Bullet Train is a thrill ride of excitement, action, and comedy. The cast complements each other with their wit and sarcasm and then duke it out in some awesome fight sequences."
rotten,"An ostensible action film that is so light on well-crafted fights one hesitates to even classify it as such, Bullet Train can best be described as a low-rent Quentin Tarantino imitation though without anything of its own to stand on."
rotten,It doesn’t work as an action movie any better than it works as a comedy.
rotten,Bullet Train is a patchwork quilt of bombastic ideas put together with a dodgy sewing machine.
fresh,Bullet Train has its moments -- Leitch's action bonafides are still definitely on display -- but it's sadly a step down after the remarkable Atomic Blonde.
fresh,The cast is top-notch. It’s fun to see Pitt playing somewhat against type with all his moments of self-doubt and angst over being pressed into fighting and killing instead of “talking it out”.
fresh,"Bullet Train has its heart in the rate place because it just wants to offer viewers a fun time at the movies. A big screen, fast-paced, fun, darkly comic, and relentlessly overstuffed adventure movie to entertain the masses."
fresh,"Entertaining, eye-catching, witty, comedic, and just over-the-top creative."
rotten,"There's a glib amorality about this action farce, but Pitt is funny as a philosophical self-help-reading dude-bro assassin."
rotten,"Brad Pitt should be the perfect actor for this comedy adventure on a speeding train, but he doesn't bring enough charm to keep this train running."
fresh,"If he wants it, Pitt finally has his franchise. It’s ruthless, cleverly bloody and filled with David Leitch’s Atomic Blonde violent choreography. Mega-star Pitt lets co-star Taylor-Johnson display all the movie’s sex in an expensive suit."
rotten,"While you can detect a lot of hard work, it still results in a strange strain of overall blandness."
fresh,... basically a fun but predictable video game.
rotten,"It’s a fun ride to be sure, but an uneven one that nearly squanders such a talented ensemble."
rotten,"Don’t let the glossy trailers fool you — Brad Pitt’s new action comedy, Bullet Train, is a strenuous and leaden film that never takes off."
fresh,A fun movie that was just one script element and one plot point too much for itself.
fresh,"Sure it is a little long and sometimes a little too cute for its own good, but ultimately it delivers on exactly what it sets out to do -- giving the audience a blood-soaked good time with a lot of laughs mixed in."
fresh,"Even though Bullet Train mistakes style for substance, it has the good sense to look awesome."
rotten,"“Bullet Train” has a story to tell, but director David Leitch, a former stuntman for Pitt, Jean-Claude Van Damme, and Matt Damon, tells it in slapdash fashion. Much of the material is played for laughs, but little of it is actually humorous."
rotten,What it turns out to be is an odd assortment of subplots and flashbacks which disrupt the flow of the main story.
rotten,"Coupling humor with foul language and splatter-gore violence isn’t a new technique, but Bullet Train tries to convince you that it’s doing something fresh with its large ensemble cast."
rotten,"I will not use the term “train wreck.” But by the end, the joke is on anyone who was looking for something more than a wild ride."
fresh,"Though not without its controversy, the film is an enjoyable romp to sit down and take all in for its outrageous action and over-the-top story."
fresh,The largely entertaining action flick Bullet Train rolls along on the power of Brad Pitt’s megawatt charisma – and sometimes on that alone.
rotten,Bullet Train is a brainless action movie that the star-studded cast can’t save.
fresh,"There are some attempts at intrigue, the now requisite random A-list cameos, and some genuine comedy from Pitt, mostly."
rotten,"This film is a cartoonish action-comedy, superimposed on a super gross and grisly backdrop even Pitt and the rest of the cast can’t save. This Bullet Train goes off the rails as a fast trip to nowhere."
rotten,"Bullet Train certainly serves the Brad Pitt brand, but it’s too weak to deliver him to a new destination."
fresh,"This was a nice change of pace from movies that want you to think about stuff. Bullet Train lets you not think about stuff, and then gently reminds you of the stuff you do need to remember"
fresh,Bullet Train is deft enough to give each confrontation stakes and each character their time to shine.
rotten,"Super-quick, hyper-quirky, cartoonishly violent and garishly good-looking, this comedy-action flick works as idiotic fun but ultimately self-sabotages by trying too hard to be clever."
fresh,"Witty mayhem is unleashed in this action comedy...While there are enough ridiculous character details and throwaway gags to keep us chuckling, director David Leitch ironically struggles to build momentum."
rotten,"At a certain point, the joke is that Bullet Train is The Cannonball Run on a bullet train."
rotten,"Worse, the film seldom takes advantage of its setting. For most of the caper, this could have been a door-slamming farce set just about anywhere, like a hotel..."
fresh,Bullet Train provides a breezy dose of summer movie entertainment despite its turbulent inconsistencies.
fresh,Bullet Train is a pleasant surprise in more ways than one.  [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Though the dialogue has few laughs, the acting and humorously complex story make it worth a train ticket."
rotten,"With a whitewashed and underused cast [...] and humour that needed more time in the oven, Bullet Train fails most of its accompaniments. And [David] Leitch has shown that he doesn't know what makes good action for the third time in a row."
fresh,"This film adaptation, by screenwriter Zak Olkewicz, is a blessing and a curse. It creates, builds and lights the fuse on this Molotov cocktail. But the script’s overabundance of characters, dips in momentum and protracted ending don’t help."
fresh,"Watching Bullet Train, one thing came to mind: fun. The actors look to be having a blast, and the many laughs rolling through my small screening showed the audience having just as much fun. This movie is a big, bold action comedy that pulls no punches"
rotten,It’s nice to know that Chad Stahelski was the true mastermind behind the first John Wick flick and not Leitch.
fresh,"... Often good fun but there's a sense of smugness about it, as if the audience is being invited to share in a private joke being told by the filmmakers, that makes it a slightly wearying experience at times."
fresh,"Wants to be wittier than it is but it hardly matters, it entertains and demonstrates that it can play better than almost any Marvel movie with similar ingredients. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"With its colourful but two-dimensional cast and constant flashbacks alongside shock reveals, this surprisingly talky film comes off as a salute to Guy Ritchie and Tarantino imitators, only with a more flamboyant approach to murder."
fresh,"While some will detest this sort of rambunctious, frenzied, in-your-face mayhem, many fans of the genre will join me in enthusiastically screaming, “shoot this into my veins!”"
fresh,"It's off the rails, in a mostly good way."
rotten,"The inspired premise of Bullet Train and the game ensemble cast holds lots of opportunities to make a wholly enjoyable film. However, the undisciplined filmmaking and shoddy script brings the film to a complete stop."
fresh,"Bullet Train is a perfect example of style over substance. You’ll enjoy it as you watch it, then the memory will zoom away minutes later."
rotten,Bullet Train is ultimately an overly generic and dated blockbuster beneath a shiny veneer that feels like a small fraction of the film it could have been.
rotten,"Hard as he may try, Brad Pitt does not have enough backing from the screenplay to pull off a miracle and prevent the ride from running aground."
rotten,"Leitch gets more than half way to his destination, not a disaster but less than a triumph for a movie that seems to have big-time summer box-office ambitions."
fresh,"Bullet Train transforms into an exquisite Rube Goldberg machine, setting up and knocking down proverbial dominoes with such finesse it’s impossible not to be taken along for the ride."
rotten,"Ends up being too long for its own good, and a pale riff on the styles of Tarantino and Ritchie. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,An intricate plot that never becomes clear.
fresh,"Oftentimes novels end up feeling either incomplete or overstuffed when translated to the big screen, but in the case of director David Leitch’s candy-colored actioner, it all comes across clean and goes down smooth — if you’re into this flavor of cinema."
rotten,"For me, it lacked any real emotional stakes, and the homestretch grows overblown and tediously overextended."
fresh,"There is a curious appeal to how you can almost ignore everything else going on and enjoy Pitt’s goofy, average Joe assassin along with the colorful images director David Leitch puts on the screen."
rotten,Bullet Train is infuriatingly pleased with itself. And ground zero for this implosion of self-satisfaction is Pitt.
fresh,Bullet Train is not always on the right track. I like this carefree Brad Pitt and I recommend it strictly because of his presence.
rotten,"The plot is a tagliatelle of insubstantiality. Just assume that everyone is set to double-cross everyone else. The dialogue, alas, dwells far too much in the pop-culture miasma that may be Quentin Tarantino’s most regrettable gift to the culture."
fresh,"Thanks to the talents of the cast and the basic visual competence that comes from Leitch’s years of action experience, you’ll have a pleasant ride, even if you don’t find the experience unforgettable."
rotten,"There’s a storyline in there somewhere, but this rapid transit is long and has so many cars you may need Google Maps."
rotten,"This may not turn out to be the worst picture of the year, but it will come close! Minus any character development, it's filled with chaotic, confusing, almost non-stop violence that becomes tediously boring."
rotten,"A couple of great personas aside, including 'twins' nicknamed 'Tangerine and Lemon,' 'Bullet Train' keeps getting slowed down by flashbacks to exceptional violence and cutesy phone banter between its big-name players."
rotten,"The cast is, on paper, terrific, but there’s nothing engaging in their bloody savagery. A misfire of a supposed action comedy, this mind-numbing mess is by turns grating, tedious, and infuriating."
fresh,"There’s a time and a place for mayhem, and that’s essentially what Bullet Train is: two hours of fights, carnage, and witty repartee."
fresh,"If you start thinking about the logic, then it goes off the rails. Leave your brain at the door."
fresh,Bullet Train is a throwback to the Tarantino and Rodriguez rip-off era. It's fun but you can feel it trying too hard.
rotten,"If there’s a joke that doesn’t land for you in 'Bullet Train,' you’d better learn to love it anyway, because it’s gonna get repeated ad infinitum over the next two hours and change."
fresh,Brad Pitt keeps the dark action thriller from derailing resulting in a fun-filled popcorn movie that leans heavily on comedy.
fresh,"Bullet Train, though a familiar premise through the eyes of modern Japan moves faster than a speeding bullet (yes the pun is intentional), while reminding audiences if you do not control your fate...it will control you."
fresh,An essential film to understand the future of the MCU. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a film that also manages to balance VFX spectacle and groundedness in its third act. And although the conclusion feels slightly rushed, the ending is better than that of many MCU films we’ve seen lately."
fresh,"It may feel like the director ordered a truckload of kitchen sinks to throw into this chaotic, complicated-yet-dumb, serious-yet-silly, imperfect extravaganza, but he still manages to serve up an astonishing tale."
fresh,While I still like the film overall. Every MCU movie now just becoming setup for the next is making characters like Ant-Man lose some of their charm.
rotten,"the two-dimensional supporting characters and bloated, derivative universe-building feel like pink filler for too long before flashbacks reveal Janet and Kang’s time together and give us some pique of interest."
rotten,The errors are easy to miss because the script and all of the acting performances are drenched in a goop of CGI characters that obliterate everything in their path.
rotten,"Excessive, repetitive, unnecessary dialogue driven by exposition, along with a lack of stronger tonal balance and an underdeveloped narrative devoid of true stakes - character arcs are almost non-existent - make this an overall very inconsistent watch."
rotten,This is yet another Marvel movie where the tired trope makes its way into driving the plot: A character does something foolish which creates havoc for their world while most of the original cast is separated from one another the bulk of the time.
rotten,"For most of its run-time, it feels like a filler episode of an anime, with only its climax operating as a narrative “threshold”."
rotten,Ant Man And The Wasp Quantumania  The film’s first act kicks off as a badass Star Wars Adventure BUT slowly tires out towards the middle. Fun? Absolutely! Exposition heavy? Yes! A mixed bag overall
rotten,Marvel isn’t in the business of telling stories. They are in the business of selling action figures. That’s why you have so many characters wearing brand-new but hideous-looking costumes frolicking around to pad the runtime.
fresh,Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good time.
rotten,This movie looks bad.
rotten,"Everything about it is phony and flat from the start, visually unappealing and narratively aimless."
rotten,The supposedly limitless storytelling device has been pushed to its narrative limits. Just look to Quantumania for proof.
rotten,Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror is almost the only great thing about this quasi-animated film that was supposed to bring life to a most expected quantum realm. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Creative world building and a compelling villain performance from Jonathan Majors helps 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' deliver as a solid superhero movie.
rotten,"Like it or not, this is the ouroboros the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become. Kang's backstory may be a little more convoluted than Thanos's, but in the end he also just wants to ""burn the broken worlds"" to create a better one."
rotten,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Phase Ho-Hum ended with the release of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Phase Shoulder Shrug kicks off with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania."
rotten,"This feels like a ""stepping stone"" film that came off like a ""Star Wars"" rip-off. This didn't move the needle for the MCU or these characters."
rotten,I wasn't a big fan of this movie and some of the performances. I was surprised with how low the stakes in this story were. Kang was wasted and Michael Pena was greatly missed.
rotten,"While it had some pleasing visuals and some strong performances from Paul Rudd and others Quantumania still managed to fall flat. It’s not a bad film, it’s not a good film, it’s firmly in the extremely mundane middle…"
rotten,"…this film’s action sorely lacks the ingenious charm offered by the super-scale skirmishes seen in the first two Ant-Man films, and the result is incomprehensible gibberish…"
rotten,All you’ll find is another building block of content that will come out quarterly but leave no lasting impression.
fresh,It's a two-hour-long computer-generated video game that stays afloat because of two things: Rudd's comic timing and Majors' acting clinic.
fresh,"Visually, Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is incredible, with precise details and colors exploding everywhere on screen."
rotten,Be thankful you didn't squander your money at the box-office! This atrocious escapade is one of the most worthless entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
fresh,"Appropriately for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s tiniest heroes, the charms of “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” are small, but still satisfying,"
rotten,"The general color-drenched too-muchness of it all might be tolerable if the plot wasn’t such a by-the-numbers slog, alternating hyperkinetic action sequences with draggy recitations of exposition."
rotten,...this trip into Quantumania is a missed opportunity.
rotten,"Most unfortunate of all, the usually reliable Paul Rudd coasts through this one, wearing his charisma like an old shirt that he forgot to wash and iron before putting on, assuming we'd just love seeing it (and him) again."
fresh,Quantumania has the goods. It lets Majors take new big bad Kang out for a joyride without feeling like he’s just slumming it in an Ant-Man picture.
fresh,"The MCU spent Phase 4 showing a sprawling universe at some point, they’re all going to have to come together to beat the crap out of each other. We’ve got a whole multiverse to sit down to, so let Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania be that appetizer."
fresh,I love Marvel and understand the implications the film is supposed to have as it ushers in Phase 5. What I’m at a loss to understand is just why this task was laid at the feet of Ant-Man.
rotten,"Because audiences warm to Paul Rudd’s humor, his third stand-alone Ant-Man outing should have gone for the laughs, not some convoluted mythology that explains nothing."
fresh,"Far from the best the MCU has to offer but fun, energetic, and quirky enough to overlook its flaws. Also: Jonathan Majors."
rotten,"While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s overwhelming onslaught of half baked CGI and hamfisted performances may be the bulk of the film’s over two hour runtime, one performer who isn’t sleepwalking to his payday is Jonathan Majors."
rotten,A disastrous mess with the Ant population expanding. Even the family gardener has a suit which means Scott Lang’s role is reduced to carrying everybody’s luggage.
rotten,"You have a great cast that gets lost in an overstuffed story. There's no emotional connections, so many of the characters just didn't get enough screen time, and the goals of what they're setting up with Kang feel too abstract."
rotten,I cannot imagine ranking it anywhere other than dead last out of the 31 features presently constituting the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
rotten,Clumsy storytelling and underdeveloped characters unfortunately prevented it from being the spectacular strong start that Phase 5 needed it to be.
rotten,"Quantumania is a lifeless, mirthless CGI saturnalia that dispenses almost entirely with the emotional core of its characters. In its place, Peyton Reed and his production team have resorted to the worst sort of empty spectacle filmmaking."
rotten,"The whole thing seems to be built almost entirely on cliches and tropes, with no gravity, no sense of impact or consequence."
fresh,"As a standalone movie, it falls squarely right in the center of worth it and not worth it to see in theaters."
rotten,"Despite a smattering of jokes, Peyton Reed’s film just isn’t as much fun as the others."
rotten,With very small powers come no real responsibilities.
rotten,Not even Rudd’s effortless charisma can save the characters from feeling lost against a background of grey-brown sludge and unremarkable landscaping.
fresh,"I liked this film a lot, the fun and the humor are still there, but the stakes are definitively raised."
fresh,"... While the film has a bunch of things to pick apart, it's aesthetic and visual enjoyability isn't one of them."
fresh,"I thought this was fun, entertaining, visually interesting, the characters worked well, and the villain is spot on. Is it amazing? Is it top tier? No, I don't think it was ever going to be. But I don't regret my time with it."
rotten,[Jonathan Majors] elevated the material and was in a realm altogether... [But the movie] was too drunk on its own mythology.
fresh,"Jonathan Majors is just outstanding. He's in a different movie, giving a Shakespearean performance in what is otherwise... well, it's Ant-Man."
fresh,"""Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania"" is going to be lower on the MCU movie list. But, with its thrilling action sequences and funny one liners, this sequel makes for an enjoyable  blockbuster that's worth catching on the big screen."
rotten,"ANT-MAN & THE WASP: Quantumania feels more like a Disney+ special than a film.  It’s messy, overindulgent on weak CGI, and humor falls flat. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang but Marvel seemed more focused on creating a 2-hour trailer for something better."
fresh,"Quantumania swings big, but forgets the small stuff, to its own detriment."
rotten,A movie about Ant-Man & Wasp would do well to focus on Ant-Man & Wasp.
rotten,"In a universe with 20+ films, one of them has to be the worst, and Quantamania is a strong contender for that inauspicious title, lacking any emotional mooring or reason to care whatsoever"
rotten,"Ant-Man is for wacky capers and comic relief in Avengers movies, not exposition-heavy narrative centerpieces responsible for setting up the next three years of cinematic storytelling."
rotten,"31 films deep in the MCU means there are bound to be a few duds. The barrage of overblown effects and a story devoid of emotion makes this entry a bottom dweller. The good news, Phase 5 can only get better."
rotten,"Anyone who fears that too many blockbusters are becoming too similar won't feel fortunate while watching... The MCU is going massive on Kang, patently; if only it'd kept the Ant-Man pictures small."
fresh,"More sci-fi than superhero flick this time, taking cues from Star Wars and gets really fantastical. While it may not be the best in the series, it's a totally fun installment and one that's worth seeing on the big screen."
fresh,"All of this makes the plot feel both murky and corny, while the action is less than convincing. Still, the cast is on fine form, finding moments of emotion alongside the snarky relationship humour."
rotten,A prologue that desperately seeks to make the irrelevant relevant. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The Quantum Realm is strikingly similar to that other space movie, if not a chintzy reproduction whose heavy CGI work is like lipstick on a space boar."
rotten,"I can't remember ever wanting to walk out during a press screening of any post-2008 Marvel movie, but I had the urge this time around and wouldn't have missed much had I followed that impulse."
fresh,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania is pure, indulgent escapism that never forgets comic book movies are supposed to be fun."
rotten,"The ensuing plot is mostly gibberish, full of universe-threatening stakes that are too easily overcome."
fresh,"After three movies, and a couple of Avengers appearances, we finally get a Scott and Cassie movie."
fresh,"Is it worth watching this to keep up with the MCU? Sure. It's hard not to root for the ""little guy."" But this movie is ""just fine"" instead of particularly funny, thrilling, or memorable."
rotten,Crawls instead of buzzes.
rotten,"The more appealing thing about the whole enterprise is the mental image of these former A-listers hanging out between takes, swapping stories of the old days and competing over who least understands the script."
rotten,"By virtue of placing a character that is nearly street level with a universe threatening opponent, you have to make the movie rise to meet it. However Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is largely stuck in needing to be bigger."
fresh,"Portrayed by Jonathan Majors, Kang is an intense menacing presence who gives the MCU the jolt it has sorely needed since Avengers: End Game."
fresh,"nt-Man 3 is a fun if predictable superhero movie that gets a few big things wrong, but bounces back on the strength of its leads, with both Paul Rudd and Jonathan Majors knocking it out of the park."
fresh,A return to what Marvel does best ... teasing the next movie.
rotten,"Rarely has a film about a family in peril been so utterly devoid of suspense. The problem, it seems, is that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania exists as part of a larger enterprise."
rotten,One good scene can't fix a film overloaded with so much plot -- and so many characters -- that you'll actually wish everyone slowed down to tell their corny jokes.
rotten,The thrill is gone. The Marvel Universe shoots a blank. A tiny one.
fresh,"The stand-out element is Majors, whose unsettlingly cool, calm and collected performance as Kang will have you eagerly anticipating his next MCU appearance."
fresh,"As another Merry Marvel Continuity Exercise, it could be a lot worse. At least they have a compellingly-acted villain again, even if they aren’t quite sure what to do with him on the way to their destination."
rotten,"'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' is the weirdest, most fun movie of the three. Yet, it's bogged down by serving as another stepping stone on the road to Marvel's Multiverse Saga."
fresh,"An uneven mix of comedy and action that lacks epicness, but thrives on introducing a dangerous new villain. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts. and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm."
rotten,It's nice Hollywood's been scouring metaphysical and cosmological texts and translating them into comic book popcorn entertainment (The Quantum Realm!) but the over-usage of CGI as a lazy replacement for the craft of good storytelling is tedious.
fresh,"There are some truly fun pieces to it, some genuinely inventive and impressive visuals, and a mostly likable cast. But it doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the blurred, messy palette that the MCU has become to truly stand out. It’s… fine."
fresh,"Tentatively pushing into broader fantasy cinema, it retains frissons for those of us who did grow up having our imaginations blown open by Jack Kirby."
fresh,"As far as superhero action movies go, this one works well enough. There is plenty of action and plenty of imaginative eye candy. The acting is good. The soundtrack is also solid. It should prove to be a popular addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
fresh,"It suffers from some script problems in the first half, but it ultimately delivers a bonkers but exciting gateway to the next Marvel phase."
fresh,"The visuals are so busy, the jokes so tame, the homilies so overfamiliar, the only option is surrendering to the chaos. But those pros Pfeiffer and Douglas up the game with an interstellar Romancing the Stone vibe."
rotten,The lackluster writing and typical Marvel clichés don't allow for Rudd's effortless charm to carry the character.
fresh,"Thoroughly enjoyed Ant Man And The Wasp: Quantumania. Jonathan Majors is a superstar with Michelle Pfeiffer matching him beat for beat. The world building of the Quantum Realm is stunning. It has the right mix of humor, emotional stakes, action, and awe."
rotten,Talent can't hide the fact that the movie gets less and less interesting as it progresses.  [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,It is good moments overwhelmed by a bloated structure.
rotten,"While an ant can lift  5,000 times its own body weight, there's little to support here."
fresh,"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania takes you on a fun adventure. And, as always, stay back for Easter eggs in the mid and post credit scenes."
rotten,"This film is silly and messy and pretty and trippy, and though it fulfills the obligations of vweepy laser fights, digital everything, and several different varieties of product placement, it’s not going to reshape the marketplace."
fresh,"One of Marvel's most visually inventive films with fantastical world-building, and the franchise's most imposing villain yet in Kang the Conqueror."
fresh,"Nearly immediately, director Peyton Reed stomps on the gas, plunging our itsy-bitsy heroes into chases, fistfights, battle sequences and other assorted setpieces."
rotten,You really don't have to do this to yourself. You have the power to walk away.
fresh,The real badass presence of Jonathan Majors  and Michelle Pfeiffer going toe to toe in the mulitverse will keep audiences on their toes and salivating for more.
fresh,Quantumania maintains the quirky fun of the Ant-Man movies and is a great introduction to Kang but it struggles with massively combating tones. It's solid entertainment but the MCU bag of tricks have become redundant and exhausting.
rotten,“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” is a visual exposition filled with childish jokes and underwritten characters. Phase Five has me asking why I should root for the little guy when there’s a titan like Majors portraying Kang.
fresh,"A superhero epic of gargantuan proportions that overwhelms and overstimulates, but still manages to deliver some human emotions despite the CGI circus."
fresh,"The overall narrative is pedestrian but offers enough flashes, bangs, and general weirdness for those who prefer to sit back and absorb such things."
rotten,"On the whole, Quantamania lacked heart because the actors didn't really have anything to work with, and it felt like Disney/Marvel didn't really care about the film at all."
fresh,"""Quantumania"" has greater stakes and a grander canvas than the more lighthearted previous chapters of the Ant-Man saga, and the film mostly negotiates the tricky tonal shift -- even if the results are more predictable than spectacular."
fresh,"QUANTUMANIA takes the us deep into a micro-verse in this action-adventure space opera, introducing us to a strange new world and bringing a new big bad to the MCU, while reminding us all that it's never too late to stop being a dick."
rotten,"After an encouraging start, Quantumania succumbs to mediocrity when it had the chance to propel the MCU forward effectively. Jonathan Majors is great, but the movie is anything but."
rotten,"A dire and crummy movie, one of the worst ever produced by Marvel."
rotten,"Part 3 plugs all of it back into Feige and company’s plan, an increasingly bland one. Maybe it’s Marvel fatigue or a simple case of sequelitis, but the magic in these films has ceased to exist."
rotten,"It feels like Marvel is starting to spin its wheels a bit, with this Ant-Man movie a weird blend of refried Guardians of the Galaxy and a far-less interesting extension of what Loki was doing with all the multiverse hubbub."
rotten,"That’s what I like about these Marvel films, man. I get older, and they stay the same."
rotten,"The film’s main asset is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror: his performance, with its velvet-soft line deliveries and unfathomable, boundless rage, is the magnetic core of this incoherent effects-dump of a movie."
fresh,"Without, apparently, greater airs than entertain and offer a different experience within the recen moth-eaten offer of Marvel Studios, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' sets a fantastic start for the Phase 5."
rotten,There is a universe out there where Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is a good movie. It ain't this one.
fresh,"Undermined like too many recent MCU entries by murky, muddy visuals ... an under-motivated, underdeveloped super-villain, a script light on humour and long on family drama, [the film] at least benefits from an unsurprisingly strong cast"
rotten,"Nothing more than a desperate money grab for Marvel, overplaying an already weak minor character, to bide time for the next phase."
rotten,Jonathan Majors is great but his Kang—the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s next big bad—suffers in a film that looks fake and struggles to sketch an arc for its growing ensemble.
rotten,"Despite strong performances from the cast, 'Quantumania' is dull and exhausting to sit through. Marvel’s glory days might be behind us and I’m really not looking forward to the rest of Phase Five."
rotten,"And yet, there it was, that thought, overarching and overwhelming: “I didn’t feel a thing.”"
rotten,"Unsure if my brain will ever fully heal from what Chazelle goes-for-broke with in the extended finale, but one thing is certain: audiences may very well never see anything like it ever again. Whether that’s for better or worse is up to the viewer..."
fresh,Babylon is built on the idea that the primary goal of the film world is to make the viewer feel something even if it is disgust and pity.
fresh,"All-embracing, all-consuming, and yet wholly intimate, Chazelle’s masterful epic is not only an ode to where film came from but where it will further journey to continue capturing our hearts, minds, and souls."
fresh,An eyeball-searing trip into a version of writer-director Chazelle’s Hollywood.
fresh,"Babylon’ goes big and refuses to be ignored, even if a much better, much shorter movie exists somewhere inside the messy sprawl."
fresh,"Movie lovers will take to ""Babylon"" with a great deal of admiration, while others might struggle to notice how much it resonates within the film industry as part of historical importance."
fresh,"Damien Chazelle’s Love Letter to Hollywood, Movies, Filmmaking, & its stars. A beautiful, hilarious, insane, ride through the debauchery of Hollywood & the stunning aspects of making a film. Wolf of Wall Street meets Hollywood. I LOVED it."
fresh,Chazelle cracks the fantasy facade of the film by breaking down the moving images into a collection of frames and solid colors that make us question how we actually perceive the screen.
rotten,"Babylon is pure excess, to its own detriment. Chazelle became so lost in frolicking in the playground of the 1920s Hollywood he’s created that he forgot to tie it all together into something meaningful."
fresh,"Babylon is a visual feast full of committed performances, charting years of the start of Hollywood’s Golden Age with all involved clearly having a riot."
fresh,"Chazelle frames it as a tragicomic exercise that underscores power dynamics and the filmmaking process in a golden age of Hollywood cloaked in frenzy, elegance and fading stars on the brink of the abyss. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Repulsive, wretched excess..."
rotten,"Chazelle seems to have abandoned the moving humanism that animated his early films, opting instead to wallow in grotesquerie, absurdity, and debauchery"
fresh,A fascinating mess.
rotten,"Babylon is ambitious, and costly—and almost a complete shambles. It is badly constructed and unconvincingly done, providing little or no insight into the film industry, culture in general or American society."
fresh,"For all that is great and grand in its use of history, the film is long and you can feel it, a problem when making an epic."
rotten,"As it stands, after two movies that started the “White People Freaking Out About Jazz” genre, I don’t have a lot of faith in Chazelle telling these stories and Babylon has shown me that my fears were founded."
rotten,Babylon’s sound-recording scene replicates Singin’ in the Rain’s as something dire and unfunny and way too long.
fresh,"A filthy, funny, frenetic film that might be the weirdest holiday-season release in recent memory."
fresh,The writing utilises pitch black humour to lambast a terrible system while still sincerely acknowledging the beauty of the artform.
rotten,Chazelle appears to have mistaken his own dexterity for directing.
fresh,"Babylon is an easy film to hate. Chazelle’s work is sloppy, arrogant, and self-indulgent bordering on masturbatory, but also irritatingly beautiful and hard to get out of one’s head."
fresh,"Outside of these production moments, the film feels like it’s toiling away at revealing plot threads that aren’t nearly as engaging as they could be."
rotten,"Surely there came a point in this extravaganza when the director, the producers, the actors, and the people who did the catering, began to feel it had all gone wrong."
fresh,"Chazelle’s overstuffed homage to old Hollywood is often totally bonkers, but it’s also consistently mesmerizing. Running longer than 3 hours, it's an undeniably self-indulgent exercise, but one that showcases magnificent craftsmanship at every level."
fresh,"It may have been a box office failure, but all three hours are utilized perfectly and never goes flat."
fresh,"Babylon is as chaotic and messy as what it tries to describe, but it's wonderful, and manages to make us reflect on the implications of fame, with its moments of glory and decline. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The back half of the film, while it does have its highlights, demonstrates an inability for the movie to fully carry its own weight, and the multi-faceted narrative descends into tropes and some groan-worthy material before the end credits start to roll."
fresh,"With Babylon, though, Chazelle gives us magic, but trumps it with sheer, unadulterated madness."
rotten,There’s nothing personal or profound in this messy imagination of the early movies; it’s just a spectacle reduced to tics and gimmicks.
fresh,"Damien Chazelle’s bonkers biopic about the excess of Old Hollywood will bowl you over in the best way, but it might leave you scratching your head in confusion too"
fresh,[Babylon] is a bumpy ride but rarely feels tedious.
rotten,So bad it's shocking.  Such of waste of acting talent.  This is what happens when Hollywood calls someone a genuis and lets them create without ever having to think twice about any of their decisions.
fresh,This is an absolutely repugnant masterpiece. It is a romantic nightmare. It is bat-shit crazy. And I loved every last second of it.
rotten,"Babylon lurches from moment to moment. It is full of half-ideas but lacking in the imagination to do much with it. Instead, it feigns jocularity while feeling unspontaneous and unnatural in its convulsions, too studied and tedious to excite."
rotten,"Attempts to out-Fellini Fellini are regrettable and for much of its length Babylon is an unsubtle and indigestible mess so that despite all the talent involved and the fascinating subject matter, it must be seen as something of a disaster."
fresh,"A more ruthless editor could easily have stream-lined a stronger piece, but as it stands it’s a bedazzling screech of a film that threw restraint out the window, where it landed in a pile of Robbie’s vomit on a designer rug. It’s bonkers."
fresh,"A relentless and ravenous movie that's always a lot, not just in length, but is dazzling (and also very funny) when it clicks."
rotten,"Judged against Chazelle’s previous work, Babylon lacks the edge of Whiplash, the heart of La La Land, and the focus of First Man. Such a well-versed student of cinema should know better than to fall into self-indulgence."
fresh,"A prurient, celebratory, confused, scandalized, and sad celebration of the notion of Old Hollywood as a place of incomparable possibility and freedom."
fresh,"At its best, Babylon is indecently good fun."
fresh,... An intense tribute to cinema that delights hard-core cinephiles. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"It's a different kind of Damien Chazelle film. It's more cynical, it's more mean-spirited, in fact it almost feels like a response to LA LA LAND and what happened after that film's notorious ""win"" at the Oscars."
rotten,An artistic melting pot. Babylon is an uneven and disorganized film in line with the Hollywood carousel of cheap impressions that spins in all directions yet never bets on any. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Subtle it is not. Nor is it good.
rotten,Blah-blah land.
fresh,"Watching the film is like riding a rollercoaster in a storm of images, lifted on the rhythms of Justin Hurwitz’s compelling score."
rotten,"If anything, Babylon is too good a recreation of late-silent era Hollywood – it’s self-indulgent, overwrought, underwritten, and following a full-frontal assault on the senses, peters out into irrelevance."
fresh,"Chazelle’s film commemorates the era’s hubris as it indulges in a bit of its own.  This is how a world ends. Not with a whimper but a great deal of banging, baby. And vomiting. And snorting."
fresh,"I staggered out trying to shake off not just the onset of cramp, but also the vague, dispiriting sense that I'd just been hoodwinked by the ending into thinking that Babylon is a better film than it is."
rotten,An exercise of superlative narcissism that's as hollow as it's irritating and amorphous. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"As uneven as it is magnetic, Babylon is an essential chute in which Margot Robbie and Brad Pitt not only know they are the brightest stars in the sky but they make it clear that they have enjoyed it... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Much ado about nothing. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Those willing to put up with various scenes of decadence, asking us to step into an unpleasant world, will find a film that says a lot about the way fame affects people, and how they try to find something that feels fulfilling. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"It's fascinating, exciting, and wild, though it isn't hard to understand why it failed theatrically in the United States. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Chazelle struggles to make a coherent point about the morality of show business.
rotten,"Babylon is a disaster of biblical proportions, precisely because it had so much potential."
rotten,"Babylon approaches the creation of set-piece moments and vast, crowded scenes with commendable gusto, but lacks subtlety and rarely dips below its own glittering surface."
rotten,"Despite trying to recapture an important moment in Hollywood history, Babylon gets stuck with a sense of humor without depth. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Babylon is an excessive, impudent, visceral film; it is an extraordinary movie. Like any good declaration of love. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"... A film that has as many pretenses as resources, but ultimately fails because every time it reaches a peak, it tends to deflate and drift. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Babylon is not so much a film of two halves, but a third of a brilliant movie and two hours of unmitigated mess and chaos."
fresh,"…Babylon is a big, chunky, entertainingly lavish and deliberately obsessive train-set, but despite considerable effort, it remains an indulgent plaything…"
rotten,"The film feels like a terrific two-hour film crammed into three hours, the first of which is full of fits and starts. The direction is haphazard, toggling between wildness and tedium, resulting in characterizations that are thin and hard to care about."
fresh,'Babylon' is somehow both many things. It's grotesque yet gorgeous. It's obscene yet opulent. It's baffling yet bold. It's repugnant yet resplendent. It's hollow yet heartfelt. Fortune favours the brave and Chazelle isn't playing it safe here.
fresh,"In the end, Chazelle does evoke the elegiac mood he’s after, finishing with a wistful meditation on the evanescence of fame and the fragility of those who fail to survive its demands."
rotten,"While Babylon starts as a big, sloppy visual treat, it finishes as the cinematic equivalent of a pile of dung."
fresh,"The cast's commitment is extraordinary, especially Robbie's, a true force of nature, and Pitt's, to whom Chazelle devotes his most indulgent gaze. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"If this is what failure looks like, then let's have more of it. I'd rather see a film that fails this boldly, than one that succeeds meekly, any day at all."
fresh,"The three protagonists carry the weight of the story, which comes with a few surprises. Each of them has a scene to shine. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The tragi-comedy is an epic of decadence and depravity. It is crude, profligate and staggeringly audacious, but there is never any doubting Chazelle’s heady passion for the movies however ugly the business."
rotten,The film ultimately offers something like a square's take on Hollywood as seen through the eyes of Kenneth Anger.
fresh,"The composition of Babylon is a masterpiece in production, including costume, music, cinematography -- and yet, there is something missing in the mélange."
fresh,"Fascinating, heart-breaking, laugh out loud and consistently entertaining. Babylon is evidently not for everyone... but those who'll love it, will truly love, warts and all."
fresh,"As a movie monument to movie-making itself, Babylon served me up some unforgettable moments and his grand finale catapulted me out of the cinema."
rotten,"Is it entertaining though? Yes, yes, absolutely yes. Despite content and quality and length and being kinda bad and dumb. Despite everything, Babylon is undeniably captivating."
fresh,"Each image is there to offend, to attract attention, and perhaps to irritate. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If the running time is a tribute to 1920s excess, Chazelle should have listened harder to his old ghosts. Kid, you’re meant to leave ’em wanting more."
rotten,"Chazelle has come up with a handful of striking sequences, padded out with a whole lot of artfully directed filler making the case that - aside from a few memorable moments - the history of cinema is just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nothing."
fresh,A scabrous takedown of Tinsel Town's worst excesses in the 1920s... the run time does fizzle out and it gets a bit cheesy
rotten,"I didn't buy one second of it, for one moment."
fresh,"I absolutely loved it... What [Damien Chazelle] does that I love is tell the story in such an exaggerated, maniacal fashion that it feels truer than it's ever felt before."
fresh,"Babylon is an epic, exceptional, dynamic, in your face, chaotically wild and ultimately tragic journey through decades of filmmaking from 1920s Hollywood ... a cinematic work of art ... Babylon is that brash, bolder, bigger story compared to La La Land"
fresh,"A spectacularly long, grossly indulgent, hilariously vile ode to cinema that stands as the filmmaker’s most ambitious and divisive project to date."
rotten,"Though it’s supposed to inspire awe at how far movies have come, all it really does is showcase the extent to which Chazelle relies on other movies to compensate for this film’s deficiencies, which are evident from the off."
fresh,"A triumphant, bold, and hypervitalized celebration of the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"For a director skilled at mounting set-pieces, Chazelle is extraordinarily duff at managing structure on a larger scale: perhaps those talents don’t sit well together. Babylon has spectacular scenes yet is hopelessly unwieldy as a whole."
fresh,"Audacious, sensational and uncompromising, Babylon might be Chazelle’s best and worst film. We should be grateful such ballsy filmmakers still work within the confines of Hollywood."
fresh,"Sleazy yet high-brow, the film is going to struggle to find an audience, but one suspects that it will be endlessly critically re-evaluated."
fresh,"Babylon is a synapse-frazzling extravaganza, a libidinous bacchanal of writhing bodies, coke-dusted noses and lurid sex acts."
fresh,"While there are some notable shortcomings which holds it back from being Chazelle’s best, Babylon is a wild, manic ride in its tribute to cinema. It won’t be for everyone, but you applaud its ambition."
fresh,"Babylon itself is pure cinema, it’s an explosion of filmmaking by a director cutting loose and going hell for leather but it is also disjointed, uncurbed and not always enjoyable - the excess BECAME excessive and the delirium made ME delirious."
rotten,Whatever amazements the movie offers initially are ground down into weariness. It's a chore.
rotten,Wunderkind Chazelle seriously needs artistic supervision. Babylon is the first Millennial film so misguided that it seems hell-bent on destroying itself.
rotten,"For all Babylon’s excess, Chazelle’s self-consciously virtuosic style saps the life from even its most overcrowded tableaux."
rotten,"Babylon was ambitious, but unfortunately it was too much noise and just didn't work."
fresh,"An overwhelming yet dazzling rollercoaster through its grandiose production, bold direction and endearing characters."
fresh,"Damien Chazelle deftly captures the frenetic atmosphere of early Hollywood, the fatal fumbles of new technology, and the tragic decline of studios, actors, and careers without losing himself or the picture in the details"
fresh,"Among all its brilliance, the best quality of “Babylon” is its spot-on exploration of cultural assimilation in Hollywood. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,... Rarely do projects as ambitious as 'Babylon' manage to be so much fun. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,I'm willing to overlook Babylon's messy self-indulgence in favour of the maudlin romp it's meant to be.
fresh,"Babylon plays out like Damien Chazelle spent his lockdown listening to Karina Longworth’s “You Must Remember This” podcast, only to realize he could make his version of Boogie Nights from that material."
fresh,"It’s unquestionably Chazelle’s biggest movie, and while it might not have the same crowd-pleasing impact of “Whiplash” or “La La Land,” it also might be the best distillation yet of how and why this particular director makes movies."
rotten,"While the performances are outstanding and the movie-making scenes are often exquisite, the hedonism and debauchery of Babylon feels like a completely different movie that serves, essentially, as a MacGuffin to connect the characters."
fresh,"Babylon tries, and manages, to paint both the heaven and the hell of cinema, of creators, and of fame and fortune. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Powerful, hilarious and bleak as hell."
rotten,"It’s not really clear what Damien Chazelle is trying to accomplish in his latest, Babylon. The movie is so awful that he should probably be banished from Hollywood."
fresh,"It's foul (in language and actions), it's excessive and it's fantastic."
fresh,Chazelle is so flagrantly trying to have his cake and eat it too that it’s almost hard to get upset or annoyed at him or his film; I feel the need to grant him points for pure audacity.
rotten,"If LA LA LAND was a love letter to the magic of making movies, this is like hate mail.. with Chazelle showing how the industry treats people as disposable and ruins lives."
rotten,"He rattled off three masterpieces with the gritty drumming drama “Whiplash” (2014), the nostalgic musical romance “La La Land” (2016) and the underrated space biopic “First Man” (2018), but there must come a time that even Damien Chazelle soils the bed."
rotten,"This outrageous, obnoxious, overstuffed epic about early Hollywood’s debauchery is nothing short of a disastrous masterpiece. <i>Sort of</i>."
fresh,The rare three-hour movie you could watch twice in a row.
rotten,"As breathtakingly beautiful as this film is to watch, if falls a bit flat on character development except for Manny Torres, gorgeously portrayed by Diego Calva.  Three hours didn't bother me but not exploring racism with actors and directing sexism did."
fresh,It’s the most glamorous film about how unglamorous filmmaking is ever made.
rotten,"Flashy & fatiguing, it's grotesquely graphic - a three-hour mess of a movie. Too bad the over-the-top craftsmanship of cinematographer Linus Sandgren, production designer Florencia Martin, costumer Mary ZXophres, and editor Tom Cross is simply squandered."
fresh,Babylon deserves so much better. Hope you all enjoyed Avatar 2 while this absolutely brilliant film dies at the box office.
rotten,"Pitt and Robbie are good actors. They’re not miracle workers. Calva tries, but when you’re stuck behind an elephant, the results aren’t always good.  That’s “Babylon,” a big-budget free-for-all that should have tamed the beast, not upset it."
fresh,"If La La Land represented Chazelle in his high school freshman era, then Babylon is him as a college senior desperate to graduate."
rotten,"It is quite ironic that the same excessive, overwrought scenario that Chazelle is painting a visually stunning picture of here, is also the same overindulgence that dooms Babylon from becoming the masterpiece it deserved to be."
rotten,"Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried lurch from car chases to shoot-outs, to a bloodless romantic interlude, while the script runs out of ideas around them, and eventually settles for a lazy Bonnie and Clyde-inspired final act."
fresh,"There is Hollywood-style action, entertainment, the beauty of Amanda Seyfried as the rebellious daughter of the millionaire villain... and the charisma of Justin Timberlake. Beyond that, not much more. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The high concept science-fiction played out in ""In Time"" is as uniquely original, stylish, challenging, and enthralling as it is preposterous."
rotten,"After the novelty of the premise wears off, Niccol leaves his audience with a familiar scenario fueled by narrative clichés and pun-saturated dialogue."
fresh,"The acting is solid, if not spectacular... with a little more care and attention, In Time could have been one for the ages."
rotten,"To quote Cameron Crowe's depiction of Lester Bangs, In Time is a ""think piece"". It's just any thought process will be interrupted by some shoddy dialogue, appalling acting and muddling of tone."
rotten,The suspenseful adventure that the film prioritizes offers solid entertainment and heightened immediacy.
rotten,"There's nothing more precious than time. For that reason alone, I'll encourage you not to waste yours this weekend and avoid In Time."
fresh,Overall this film isn't heavy sci fi but it is a pretty fun ride and good sci fi film with some good use of themes and concepts that are resonating with current goings on in the world.
rotten,"All in all, In Time lacked time to get the key ingredients - as well as practically everything else that could have made it great."
rotten,The film's central metaphor is so sublimely obvious it feels like it's been stolen from a forgotten Star Trek script.
fresh,"In Time is worth seeing and it is clearly made with passion, but it doesn't have the underlying vitality that makes the best science fiction immortal."
fresh,"In Time is stylistically entertaining, but the story could have been a lot more developed."
fresh,"Slipping on an expensive suit, Timberlake's likeable lead fits in nicely. He has good chemistry with Seyfried's wide-eyed sidekick... The action is solid too, thanks to those constant deadlines."
rotten,"It's original, it's compelling, and it's completely mediocre."
fresh,"Overall, [its] a solid, well-acted, well-conceived and well-staged science fiction film of the classic, quietly cerebral Outer Limits/Twilight Zone variety."
rotten,"If you're just after popcorn thrills, then In Time is not a complete waste of time, but future generations will not remember it."
rotten,"Interesting as the film is as a science fiction concept and dull as it is as a political allegory, the Christian understands that there is a fundamental flaw in the story, namely that W.H. Auden was wrong."
fresh,"I enjoyed the film thoroughly, and realized afterward how well Niccol had drawn me into his imagined world. The first postscreening sight of a digital clock gave me the autonomic ghastlies."
rotten,The final act kind of just falls apart and the big reveal about the time keeper's backstory fell flat.
fresh,"In Time, while highly entertaining, doesn't live up to its premise."
fresh,Don't let the ads fool you: It has a lot on its mind.
rotten,In Time is so crammed with provocative ideas it begins to feel over-crowded.
rotten,"One long, extended chase sequence interspersed with awkward flirting."
fresh,"Even with its thoughtful nods to ""Bonnie & Clyde"" and ""Les Miserables,"" ""In time"" never delivers that transcendent ""Blade Runner"" moment, and never rises above cult classic to simple classic."
rotten,"There's a lot to like about In Time, but it misses the mark for being an overly memorable experience and ends up being just an adequate sci-fi flick."
rotten,"""In Time"" gets points for putting forth an interesting concept, but because of Niccol's inability to utilize that concept, we get a film that ends up going nowhere."
rotten,"Worry, worry and watch the clock, for 'In Time' wastes what time you've got."
rotten,"Andrew Niccol's dystopia never really feels like anything other than a depthless, stylish sleek surface."
rotten,"Starts out great, almost like a pseudo sequel to Niccol's other sci-fi drama Gattaca, but slowly unravels into a mindless chase picture that never really captures any real depth or meaning."
rotten,"Nothing remarkable about this futuristic adventure that reminds me a bit of ""Logan's Run."" Paul Chambers, CNN."
fresh,Andrew Niccol continues to be the go-to guy for using smartly executed science-fiction/fantasy concepts in the service of expressing ideas rather than bang-up action.
rotten,"The movie doesn't ask much of them, acting-wise, as it devolves into a chase film and doesn't spent any time examining all the thorny moral quandaries that it brings up."
rotten,"The movie meanders in circles, frustratingly wasting its intriguing premise showcasing a story of Robin Hood meets Bonnie and Clyde-like heroic villains on the run that's as rudimentary as it is forgettable."
rotten,"Prophetically arriving at about the same time as the Occupy Wall Street protests, the film couldn't be more relevant; unfortunately, it's also ham-handed."
rotten,"h skhnothetikh akribeia kai oi sygkrathmenes aisthhtikes pinelies me tis opoies employtizei ayto poy exei apofasisei na kanei, de se afhnoyn na peis thn tainia toy Niccol xasimo xronoy akribws, alla oyte kai gia quality time mporeis na thn peraseis"
rotten,Timberlake's charisma can't carry this but it's hard to think of anyone who could.
rotten,"Like a 99 Percenter in the making, Will is stunned to hear from Henry that -- oh my god! -- the system of doling out time is rigged."
rotten,Nobody should waste a minute of their life on this baloney.
rotten,Niccol's metaphor gets silly fast.
rotten,This Bonnie and Clyde couldn't have less on screen chemistry if Clyde was the orangutan from Every Which Way but Loose.
rotten,"This alternate world's hollowness drains the movie, blanching the noir. Cheesy, corny moments pop up throughout. Grinds its potential down into a clockwork chase movie."
rotten,...the movie's failure [is] especially disappointing given the enduring success of 1997's Gattaca.
fresh,Clever and unsettling.
rotten,In Time is the sort of middling sci-fi movie that you might come across a few months from now while looking for something to stream from the Internet.
rotten,"The plot is too loose and the action too slack to keep the audience fully gripped. Timberlake and Seyfried are supposed to be the ones looking fretfully at their wrists to see how much time they have to go, not the viewer."
fresh,"When time really is money, it's hard not to keep looking at your watch. Fortunately, viewing this film won't have you looking at yours."
fresh,... it works pretty well if you don't look too closely ...
fresh,"An interesting, literal 'living on borrowed time' premise doesn't quite live up to its ambition but cool film work and Justin Timberlake keep things interesting."
rotten,"In Time fills its dynamic, sprawling universe with about as much character and drama as a half-hour game of Sim City."
rotten,"It's a relatively simple but ingenious concept. Niccol, however, seems unable to get the story going without letting the film trip over itself."
rotten,The endless chases on foot and by car are unsuccessful attempts to prevent the audience thinking about the plot.
fresh,"The movie may not probe as deeply into its subject as desired, but it's nevertheless an enjoyable watch, full of propulsive action and intriguing scenarios."
fresh,"Timberlake is fine but not as good as he was in The Social Network because he doesn't get the chances. It's a pity, but this sort of thing needs a brighter director."
fresh,A playful caper that ticks along on the strength of its cast.
rotten,It's all just big-budget dress-up in a futurescape that reeks of phoniness.
fresh,"One of the film's stronger threads poses a key question: even if you could extend your life by decades, would you really want to?"
fresh,Stylish and original but its confusing middle and overbearing moral message will have you looking at the time.
fresh,"It's a plot with intriguing issues touched upon, including mortality, the class system and that knowing how much time we have left to live can affect our judgments."
rotten,In Time is The Adjustment Bureau without the charm and sexual chemistry.
rotten,"Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried play for time in a monotonous, one-note thriller"
rotten,A waste of time.
fresh,"If time really were currency, I'm not sure I'd use up 109 precious minutes on this - and yet, it's just watchable enough to not be a complete waste of time."
rotten,It's not a total waste of your time. But boy will you wish Niccol had spent more of his on it.
rotten,"Despite strong performances from a likeable cast, this squanders its potentially interesting premise and is ultimately something of a disappointment thanks to a dumbed-down script, a lack of imagination and a tendency towards heavy-handed symbolism."
fresh,Is it possible to give a film four stars for its premise and two stars for its execution?
rotten,Attempts to be both thriller and political allegory but ultimately falls someway short of being either.
rotten,"If time's so valuable, why does Seyfried run everywhere in six-inch heels?"
fresh,Good concept and an entertaining cast make this one better than it should be.
rotten,Such an original sci-fi concept that has a potent economic allegory that rouses interest in the first part then fizzles away as the action and serviceable acting dominates ...
rotten,"Niccol's major problem is timing: action sequences and dialogue scenes lie flat on the screen, while his tendency to play around with pacing means that any tension quickly dissipates. Life's too short."
fresh,"Interesting ideas and howling anger at the 1 percent drive the first half, but the Bonnie and Clyde stylings of the second feel a little rushed and strangely out of sync."
rotten,"A grown-up sci-fi idea suffering from a severe case of arrested (script) development, In Time plays like Equilibrium without the fights, or Total Recall without the fun."
fresh,"There are some nice ideas thrown around, and the film works as an analogy (albeit it a heavy-handed one) for modern society's staggeringly unjust division of wealth, but it aims to please the broadest audience possible and suffers for it."
fresh,"Messy and half-formed, but a pleasing throwback to an era in which ideas powered movies more than special effects, In Time provides a steady flow of lively entertainment due to its brain-tickling central conceit."
rotten,In Time needs a few more rewrites before it can knock on the door of great sci-fi films like 'Blade Runner.'
rotten,"In Time is half a good film - thoughtful, well-shot, and smart in places - and half a clunky, derivative, and at its worst, laughable one."
rotten,"The film is beautifully shot in chilly blues and grays by cinematographer Roger Deakins, and Los Angeles locales are well chosen for futuristic effect. Most of the time, however, I found myself glancing at the clock on my own wrist."
fresh,"For all its flaws, this remains worth some of your hard-earned time."
rotten,Not one for the ages.
rotten,"Gattaca and The Truman Show... have trained me to think of a new film from Andrew Niccol... as something of an Event... [B]ut now that In Time disappoints, too, I'm starting to worry that Niccol has said all he has to say."
fresh,"Niccol's zippy direction, joined to a sleek, rich production design, keeps the movie spinning like a shiny toy."
rotten,High concept meets lightweight substance in writer/director Andrew Niccol's clinical cartoon rendition of a not-too-distant-future dystopia.
fresh,...an ingenious and thought-provoking sci-fi chase film.
rotten,"It's all way too cut-and-dry, an enterprise in which a pedestrian plot and a straightforward aesthetic have been applied to a grand idea."
rotten,more irritating for what it should have been than satisfying for what it is
rotten,"A slickly stylized premise, adroitly rigging the economic currency, but the essential chemistry is lacking."
fresh,"Although the film lacks momentum, the premise and Timberlake's appeal makes it a more thsn decent watch."
rotten,"The Kiwi filmmaker has done great work before, and no doubt will again, but In Time is a graceless, heavy-handed bore."
rotten,It falls in the realm of mediocre sci-fi movies that you might watch on cable late in the evening.
rotten,"In Time starts out with one of the best sci-fi premises in recent memory, and then does nothing with it."
fresh,"It's the metaphor of time for money that matters, as it plays out in a battle between the haves and have nots - or, if you'd like, the 1% vs. the 99%."
rotten,"The depth of the world Niccol has created is insufficient, while the metaphors he's employing are far more on the nose than they need to be."
rotten,"A movie so consistently flat-footed, with pauses between lines of dialogue so vast, that you begin to wonder if the whole thing might be a psychological experiment of some kind."
fresh,It holds too many strong notions executed too well to let its shortcomings derail it.
rotten,Nothing more than a clumsily executed preach-a-thon.
fresh,"Happily, there are some laughs en route. More happily yet, a few of them are even intentional."
rotten,"Time really is money, people. Invest neither here."
fresh,"In Time is filled with sly references and obvious puns, as well as sometimes heavy-handed parallels to class warfare."
rotten,It's a little like Michael Bay's The Island in the way the narrative fails to live up to the promise of its back story.
rotten,"Niccol, whose excellent 1997 film Gattaca revealed a similar obsession with human genetics, is an above-average filmmaker who may simply lack the daredevil recklessness a project like this requires."
rotten,Is it worth your time? Only if you have time to kill.
rotten,Takes a great premise and totally trashes it with limp storytelling and astonishingly bad filmmaking.
rotten,The concept is mildly interesting at first-even the cops are called timekeepers-but the novelty wears off pretty fast...
fresh,"Faults aside, In Time is a great sci-fi yarn of our times."
fresh,"It brims with the energy of unrepentant rebellion, in other words, the consequences of which are politically radical (in a cartoon-like way). A cathartic experience for anyone bored with the usual Hollywood subtext."
rotten,"The rich live forever and the poor scrape by with just a day on their clocks in this sci-fi dystopia, which favors action sequences and trite catchphrases."
fresh,"Sci-fi thriller has violence, sexuality, language."
rotten,"'Ticktock on the clock, but the party don't stop.' So sang that great philosopher of our times Ke$ha, whose words are surely gospel to the ruling classes of Andrew Niccol's innocuous dystopian thriller."
fresh,"You won't be looking at your watch, which means it's at least worth the time spent."
rotten,Drab production design. Lack of tension. No chemistry between Timberlake and Seyfried. Other than that...
fresh,In Time owes as much to The Marx-Engels Reader as Bonnie and Clyde.
fresh,"Is there anything Justin Timberlake can't do? Now, he's actually a decent action star!"
rotten,"In a year full of great science fiction, In Time is weak, moronic and dumbed down to the point of diluting anything that may have made it remotely interesting."
rotten,"It's such a colorless creation, it's almost impossible to believe Niccol botched his weird idea so quickly, turning something with serious potential for lively sci-fi escapism into a miserable, static motion picture."
rotten,"With some of the cheesiest, surface-level dialogue of the year, a complete lack of chemistry between the leads, and some of the choppiest action editing of the year, In Time is a near disaster."
rotten,The rather clever concept is squandered in a low-rent action movie that really ends up being a waste of our time.
rotten,"A cool idea, but not executed as well as it could be."
rotten,"Despite a terrific concept that could make for an Inception for 2011, we get Logan's Run meets Robin Hood. And not the good parts."
fresh,"Not for one moment does Niccol compromise this serious sci-fi world, and yet he hits all the marks for crowd-pleasing mass entertainment: ""In Time"" never stops moving."
rotten,"The problem with 57 Seconds, though, is that it’s so poorly shot and thinly plotted that you’re always aware of just how sub-par the film is."
fresh,"This engaging sci-fi ride puts a new twist on the time-travel conceit. In 57 Seconds, time travel is used more like a drug instead of a mathematical concept..."
rotten,"Everything about the characters is basic, from their motivations to what informs those motivations and their personalities, to boot."
rotten,"Here’s a movie about time travel that feels like a whistlestop tour of every previous movie about time travel ever made, though one doesn’t imagine the irony is intentional."
rotten,"The cast elevates the material, which starts with promise before struggling to maintain suspense amid some eye-rolling twists."
rotten,"Parts of the movie are fairly enjoyable, but you have to look past an abundance of nonsensical material and excessively far-fetched developments."
rotten,57 Seconds succeeds in being a rom-com sci-fi suspense thriller action film that's so bad it's mildly entertaining.
rotten,"Its clear budgetary constraints and elementary style aside, 57 Seconds falls flat because it’s duller than it should be."
rotten,"Though written and directed by a Pulitzer Prize winner, Original Sin is better known as the picture in which a naked Angelina Jolie (by then a certified Oscar winner) and Antonio Banderas do the horizontal mambo. [Blu-ray]"

fresh,
rotten,
fresh,I was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable this movie was.
rotten,Um melodrama que tenta esconder sua vulgaridade atrs de uma aura de falso refinamento.
rotten,...the only sin committed was by the filmmakers producing the movie in the first place.
rotten,"What we have here is simply an erotic thriller with so many melodramatic turns, it eventually becomes laughable."
rotten,Cristofer takes liberties with the novel's downbeat ending and tacks on a happily ever after coda that seems more in keeping with something made under the studio system ...
rotten,
rotten,
rotten,
rotten,A ridiculous story about how far people will go to maintain possession of an especially phenomenal f**k.
rotten,The only sin committed here is the cardinal one of boring us to tears.
rotten,El candente verano nos trae en su cierre a Angelina Jolie y Antonio Banderas en una pelcula con la promesa de una fuerte carga ertica ...
rotten,"Recycled sin, more like it, but preposterously entertaining nonetheless."
rotten,Begs one major question: How the hell does writer-director Michael Cristofer keep getting work?
rotten,"While itis sultry, steamy and shameless, it is not, unfortunately, really good."
rotten,"While some scenes are splendidly produced, Banderas and Jolie lighting the screen with danger and amore; others fall flat."
rotten,A load of pretentious crap.
rotten,"As they engage in open-mouth kissing, they smack loudly like a couple of preschoolers woofing down greasy hamburgers."
rotten,"High on lust and low on logic, the preposterous Original Sin is an erotic thriller that evokes more laughs than sweat."
rotten,It quickly plunges us into darkness as far as sense and logic are concerned.
fresh,The movie is entertainingly bad.
rotten,"The movie is all posture, clich, and editing-room Spackle."
fresh,Thomas Jane adds a layer of ambiguous spice.
rotten,"This felt like a really bad TV movie of the week, with some nudity stuffed in from time to time, just to wake up the audience."
rotten,"One of the most torturous films of the summer, definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year."
fresh,If you can swallow some of the more overripe dialogue ... it's not nearly as mediocre a two hours as the trailers would have you think.
rotten,
rotten,A textbook case of a movie that would have been better had it been worse.
rotten,"An empty, overheated thriller straight out of bad '40s noir."
rotten,Cable fare masquerading as a theatrical feature because of its high-profile cast.
rotten,"Neither convincingly passionate nor compellingly interesting, Original Sin turns out to be a big-name disappointment."
rotten,Delightfully trashy melodrama--you got a problem with that?
rotten,"Features moments of sheer power and earnestness, and others that are so misdirected and ludicrously written, they have to be seen to be believed."
rotten,[Cristofer] presents it like one of those late-night HBO softcore flicks that tries to be 'artistic' and fails miserably.
rotten,Suggests unintentional self-parody from the get-go.
rotten,Aficionados of movies in the so-bad-they're-good category might just revel in this overheated costume melodrama.
rotten,"Original Sin is really about murky storytelling, bad dialogue and arty close-ups of Jolie's formidable lips."
rotten,"It's difficult to pinpoint what the film's first cinematic transgression might have been, but it ends up with so may of them that few, if any viewers will love or be blind-sided by what the film has to offer."
rotten,Neither epochal nor epic in its ludicrousness. It's just run-of-the-mill trash.
fresh,"Works on a sensual, insinuating level."
fresh,Makes for an extremely well-acted movie.
rotten,"Unless John Travolta has a sequel to Battlefield Earth up his sleeve, or Kevin Costner has a new project in the works, they might as well hand out the Golden Raspberry Awards right now."
rotten,The kind of movie that keeps you on your toes waiting for the next deadly serious absurdity.
rotten,"Cristofer's approach is relentlessly serious and dead-on, devoid of humor, wit or personality."
rotten,Cristofer is not able to handle subsequent double crosses. They become laughable instead of chilling.
rotten,"It's the kind of movie you'd throw a video party around, with drinking games involving, say, a chug every time Banderas tails his wife to find out what she's really up to."
rotten,It is never moving or shocking. It needs to be both.
rotten,"It's your basic, steamy black widow tale with one of the most implausible set-ups in memory."
rotten,A plateful of steamed corn.
rotten,"It wants to be a nightmarish noir mystery, a steamy sex drama and a classy historical piece."
rotten,"Loses its nerve and instead of maintaining its theme of obsession, it starts piling up absurd complications."
rotten,"Original Sin, despite the heavy-handedness, isn't awful enough to be a hilarious howler. But neither is it good enough to become the tropical noir it could have been."
rotten,Cristofer sabotages his movie by killing most of the suspense and robbing it of logic.
rotten,"A dull, languid film full of unsurprising plot twists and ludicrous soap opera-style melodrama."
rotten,"Cristofer has flashes of brilliance here, but there is simply too much trash weighing this film down."
rotten,"While you have to pity Banderas and Jolie, you also have to credit them for keeping a straight face through this nonsense."
rotten,"Not a performance that doesn't smack of contrivance, not a situation that somehow doesn't seem artificial."
rotten,"Cristofer packs so many foreboding clues into the first half-hour that a blind, deaf, and illiterate Swahili-speaker could sense there's something amiss."
rotten,The combination of a smoldering Banderas and a simmering Jolie generates as much heat as a 40-watt bulb.
fresh,It's an exuberant example of what it is -- a bodice-ripping murder 'meller' -- and at that it gets a passing grade.
rotten,"It's hard to keep a straight face just thinking of Mr. Banderas and Ms. Jolie in the same shot, but Original Sin will bore the giggles right out of you."
rotten,"Director Michael Christofer falls victim to the frivolous trappings of...pulp carnality, letting the tawdry get the better of him..."
rotten,"Even with all its delicious atmosphere, the movie is just spectacularly uninvolving."
rotten,"The only real joy in this deliriously awful film is that the wacky, bosom-heaving, lip-smacking, rat-poison-drinking psych-outs never stop until the last frame."
rotten,We haven't had this much tawdry fun since Pia Zadora and Bo Derek's heydays.
rotten,What starts off as a sleazy melodrama with intriguing co-star chemistry quickly gets bogged down in piled-up plot twists.
rotten,The film aspires to Hitchcock ... but it comes off like one of those soft-core Red Shoe Diaries flicks you see on cable TV.
rotten,The script rambles between airy pomposities ... and atrocious ribaldries.
rotten,"Whodunit is the last thing on this period thriller's mossy little mind. But motive is everything, and that's where it fails."
rotten,"One should rent the superior Mississippi Mermaid with Catherine Deneuve, which is based on the same book."
rotten,"If it had more panache, it would tumble into the infamous so-bad-it's-good category, but that's too positive a label for this sad-sack saga."
rotten,Banderas' and Jolie's characters are not recognizably human. They are engineered to fit the mechanics of plot.
rotten,"The situation is unbelievable, the characters are laughable, and the dialogue is exploding all over the place like an overripe peach."
rotten,"Watching Banderas and Jolie rolling around ... you find yourself thinking about Melanie and Billy Bob, Zorro and Lara Croft, and, ultimately, Access Hollywood."
rotten,The actors have so little chemistry delivering tired dialogue that the sluggish direction by Michael Cristofer ... is merely the final insult.
rotten,[Cristofer] gets the look of art but not the pulse.
rotten,It's both overripe and juiceless.
rotten,Right to the point -- Original Sin is terrible.
rotten,Can be recommended only to moviegoers who like pictures so outrageously bad that you can revel in their awfulness.
fresh,Half-baked Cuban burlesque that goes heavy on the camp.
rotten,"Lavish and florid, the corny venture falls into so-bad- it's-good territory."
fresh,"Rise of the Beasts is the best Transformers entry since Bumblebee, but it won’t be the last time we see these robots fight on the big screen."
rotten,"As a review, I'll give it a C+ for delivering what you'd expect. As a note, make sure to stick around for the end credit scene."
fresh,... The movie continues the current tendency of delivering a good time to the audience at the movies with a sci-fi super production that doesn't forget to also offer relatable characters. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"It plays it safe, and while that does make it watchable it doesn’t make it good."
fresh,Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is all about the heart that the story infuses into this plot about robots fighting other robots.
fresh,"Rise of The Beasts plays it safe when compared to the Bay-era, and falls short of the previous iteration Bumblebee. The movie is still funny and charming, with just enough action, and a good amount of heart."
rotten,"What an annoyance to have a 'Transformers' movie with well-drawn humans, only to have them choke on the exhaust fumes of franchise expectations."
rotten,A movie heavy on action and light on story and acting.
rotten,"Bay, at least, wasn't afraid to take chances. Rise of the Beasts, unfortunately, feels as though it's trying way too hard to color in the lines."
fresh,The seventh installment to the beloved Hasbro Toys franchise redials the overall narrative and visuals into pure nostalgia escapism that sets the Transformers back on track.
rotten,. . .A mixed bag that establishes this latest outing as less than meets the eye.
rotten,"It's all just such a wasted opportunity and a rather inconspicuous start to the heaven help us, ""Hasbro Cinematic Autoverse"", even if it's still easily the second best of the modern Transformers movies."
rotten,As dull as a smashed headlight.
fresh,"This movie is, of course, very loud, lots of special effects, but it does have a good story at it's heart, partly because Anthony Ramos & Dominique Fishback really center this film and give it a real emotional heft."
fresh,Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is a film that will be enjoyed by hardcore Transformers films and because of the re-boot vibe is easily accessible to those who haven’t seen the other films.
rotten,"Transformers Rise of the Beasts is the equivalent of looking back at your childhood when you would grab your action figures!    Fun, Amusing, & enjoyable BUT that's it The 3rd act’s Action set piece is up there with Bumblebee’s Opening Scene though!"
fresh,"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is one of the franchise’s best yet. If you’re a fan of great action, special effects and hip-hop culture with a great story, this movie is one to watch."
fresh,"After Michael Bay tarnished the essence of the Autobot spirit with his soul-draining movies, Steven Caple Jr. returns some pride to the Hasbro warriors. He does that by keeping the focus on the robots, and not the humans."
rotten,"Everything about the film is half-assed – the writing, performances and staging of action sequences are executed with a shrug."
rotten,"If you’ve been down the path several times before, you’ll realize they never really did figure out the Transformers’ purpose.  Sometimes a cool toy is just that."
rotten,some new characters (human and robot) ... liven up things enough for the first half. Yet it ultimately devolves into a big smashing robot movie that’s so-so
rotten,I don't know why they thought this was it. But this ain't it.
rotten,I don't like films produced or directed by Michael Bay. This film is no exception.
rotten,"Without Bay at the helm, the ear-screeching carnage is taken down a decibel or two. With Steven Caple Jr. (Creed II) directing, this latest battle between alien robots, clocking in at around two hours, is ever so slightly more bearable."
fresh,Has enough action for several movies and a load of heart to keep the story relevant.
rotten,Caple simply lacks the cocky bravado and 'roided-up visual panache that Bay brought to the table.
fresh,"Rise of the Beasts provides all the car chases, shootouts, and metal-on-metal mayhem you could hope for in a Transformers movie."
fresh,"Indiana Jones meets Transformers!  a successful, family-friendly mix of high-spirited adventure and humor."
rotten,"Exists at the level of narrative sophistication of children idly mashing their toys together whilst making ""pow, screech, aiieeeeeee"" noises, which is sincerely better than any of the earlier movies were able to achieve."
fresh,"A [...] wholesome, Saturday morning popcorn flick that is incredibly digestible, but ultimately forgettable as it glides through an easy 127 minutes with heart, cheese and a sense of inoffensive fun."
fresh,Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a nostalgic and entertaining 1990s thrill ride.
fresh,"Anthony Ramos is the key to maintaining a relatable story, he rocked this movie!"
rotten,"As the CGI smash-ups and solemn speeches mount, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts makes heavy going of something that ought to be a lot more fun."
fresh,A convoluted but mildly engrossing adventure.
fresh,"The great news is that director Steven Caple Jr. does such a good job maintaining the thrill-a-minute pace and the frame-filling action of the other films that it looks as though it was directed by Michael Bay. No greater praise is possible, surely."
rotten,[Director] Steven Caple Jr. [lets stars] Ramos and Fishback develop their characters and minimize the damage wrought by a uniformly awful screenplay. But doesn’t that make the inevitable downshift to robot-on-robot violence all the more joyless?
fresh,"Listen. If you're not the sort of person who's ever going to want to see a Transformers movie, that's fine. But if you are, then you might like Rise of the Beasts quite a lot."
fresh,"Much of the appeal of this movie is due to the efforts of talented and attractive actors, Dominique Fishback and Anthony Ramos. Both have a strong screen presence and plenty of emotional range for the roller coaster of events their characters go through."
fresh,"Director Steven Caple Jr serves up a perfectly respectable and often exciting tale of giant transforming robots and the humans who love them, but the gleefully demented approach of previous franchise director Michael Bay is sometimes sorely missed"
fresh,"Like Bumblebee, Rise of the Beast is a jolt of good old blockbuster fun that recharges the Transformers franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"With uneven pacing, a runtime longer than it could’ve been, and not enough good performances from the cast, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts manages to erase the good faith Bumblebee brought to the franchise."
rotten,"The dialogue and comedic punch lines feel so paint-by-numbers, you’d be hard-pressed to laugh when the music dies down just enough for them to stick the line."
rotten,"Steven Caple Jr. is a very capable director, but he appears lost on how to make anything fresh for this increasingly convoluted action series."
fresh,"Director Steven Caple Jr. interweaves genial humans and sentient machines into a coherent, spectacle-laden,  CGI-based story, credited to five screenwriters."
rotten,Just a bunch of robots (in disguise) smacking into each other and insulting each other's pants (second part of quote untrue; I made it up).
fresh,An average action/sci-fi blockbuster that progresses passively through its action and visual effects showcases.
fresh,"If you can get on its wavelength as a film at odds with itself, Rise of the Beasts is an enjoyable summer blockbuster that plays the narrative hits, good guys and bad guys in a race for a MacGuffin, and supplies the requisite action sequence."
rotten,The first 30 minutes and final 30 minutes are fun enough but Rise of the Beasts is yet another big budget movie that gets lost in its own mythology for seemingly no reason.
fresh,"Transformers Rise of the Beasts is full of unfinished ideas that would've made for a way better Transformers movie. The designs are excellent and the action sequences are fun, but the undercooked story and the Maximals leads to a good, but not great film."
fresh,"It is just a classic summer popcorn flick, but on the curve of Transformers movies, that makes it one of the better ones."
fresh,The action was easy to follow. The character development was good... it wasn't like Michael Bay mayhem. We got time to breathe. We got time to take it in.
rotten,"What you have here in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the worst of all possible IP worlds: a lifeless imitation of its predecessors that’s as annoying as it is dull, meant only to lead into an inevitable “shared universe” at some point."
rotten,"Without either Michael Bay’s maximalist flair or Bumblebee’s tenderness, Rise of the Beasts manages to be one of the lesser entries of a saga with an already low bar to clear."
fresh,"Rise of The Beasts sits comfortably in the middle of the two Transformers extremes: not as charming as Bumblebee, but far from the messy fairground antics of the Bay films. Mindless but fun in places, fans will be well-served."
fresh,"Ultimately, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a formulaic (except for the lack of romance, which is a nice change) action film featuring an angstier Optimus Prime and yet another seemingly indestructible Transformers supervillain."
rotten,"Rise of the Beasts tones down the Bay explosions for a more grounded experience about extraterrestrial robots trying to get back home and while the Transformers themselves are absolutely delightful, the humans, per usual, fall flat."
fresh,Actually quite enjoyable... a worthy entry in this Transformers franchise.
fresh,A fun Sunday matinee that kept my inner twelve year old happy.
fresh,"It has all the things that a Transformers film needs... I'm not a big fan of the franchise, but I was entertained for the most part."
fresh,"Both the performances and voice performances work well enough to make us like the characters despite the frequent lazy writing. Though it falls short of the heart shown in Bumblebee, it's an enjoyable if not wholly satisfying experience."
fresh,"Caple has crafted an energetic and charming adventure film, devoid of the cheap laughs that Bay glorified and instead going for genuinely funny jokes that aren’t at anyone’s expense, with a likable, capable cast that feels like real people."
rotten,"If you had hoped for either more of Bumblebee‘s tone, or a proper rise of Maximals, you will find yourself a bit disappointed."
rotten,"It won't convince the skeptics, but at least it won't leave them with a severe headache, like the Michael Bay movies. It will entertain them, but they will forget about it in a couple of days. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"While the plot is both simple and absurd, it's underscored by genial wit. Director Steven Caple Jr skilfully resists letting robot-vs-robot action take over. And the brisk pace mixed with knowing gags makes for a thrilling romp."
rotten,I get fatigued.
rotten,The Michael Bay films were garbage but at least had his elevated subpar vision of action sequences. This new one shows next to no personality and becomes just more metal-on-metal fighting in search of an Endgame battlefield we don't care about.
rotten,"If there are any merits to this franchise movie, it would be that it has better character development than past entries. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,The best thing about the Transformers franchise has always been the sound the Autobots make as they transform... although I’m still unsure why they would want to be disguised as a Volkswagen Beetle.
rotten,At least Peter Cullen is still getting plenty of work.
rotten,Rise of the Beasts suffers from the story cornering itself without much room to expand.
fresh,"There is enough good entertainment here to make it a perfect summer matinee movie, especially for younger audiences."
fresh,"This is what a Transformers movie should be, with a tight narrative, clean action sequences and heart whether human or robotic."
fresh,"Transformers:Rise of the Beasts is a soft reboot that has the spark to reinvigorate the franchise. Steven Caple Jr. does a rather impressive job at showing us a world closer to the source material in both story and spirit, that feels both new and familiar"
rotten,"In all fairness, I think I might have enjoyed this film if I was nine years old."
rotten,Certainly delivers on needless destruction and world-class stupidity.
fresh,"We may lose regard for the gravitas of the film’s premise, and we may know exactly where the film is headed. But it doesn’t keep “Rise of the Beasts” from rising above and delivering a clean, fun, monster-romping good time."
rotten,Transformers: Rise of the Beasts isn’t worth rolling out to the theatre for.
rotten,"[Transformers: Rise of the Beasts] relies too much on the audience’s enjoyment of Pete Davidson’s Mirage, who never forms a connection with Ramos’s Noah in the way the script needs to establish the emotional relationship it leads up to."
fresh,"The Bay versions of these films settled for fear or awe at these engines of destruction; now that’s not on the table anymore the filmmakers are at last trying to get something more developed out of it, but it may be too little, too late."
rotten,"It’s not spectacular enough to impress us, nor intimate enough to move us. It’s just kind of there — ready to be consumed and forgotten."
fresh,Does for toy robots what the 'SpiderVerse' franchise did for Marvel superheroes.
fresh,"While the battle sequences could use more style, they are solid, and this entry feels tonally consistent throughout. The two human leads are good, but the Autobots and Maximals shine."
rotten,There’s not a morsel of joy to be found in the franchise’s latest ludicrous outing.
rotten,"Even with its abundance of action, the franchise’s newest addition boasts little life or heart compared with its predecessors."
fresh,"Beasts encourages you to let your eyes glaze over through the plot exposition and embrace the visceral nonsense. Beasts is dumber than a box of hammers, but it doesn’t drip with the rote cynicism of, say, Fast X."
rotten,Dominique Fishback totally outclasses her infantile dialogue...
fresh,"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts won't reinvent the wheel, but its sci-fi action thrills prove that good live-action Transformers sequels are doable."
rotten,"More coherent than the garbage from Michael Bay, but still a noisy, overblown mess."
fresh,Transformers is sure to achieve its key role of entertaining your kids. How much is down to computers or the human touch perhaps doesn’t matter that much.
rotten,Transformers: Rise of the Beasts can be boiled down to another film about alien robots fighting over the earth while humanity can only watch in horror as they wreck havoc across the planet.
rotten,The movie doesn’t have much going for it.
fresh,Rise of the Beasts is seen as a bit more moderate and enjoyable than the Michael Bay movies. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,The only thing wrong with Transformers: Rise of the Beast is that it’s bland and boring.
fresh,"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is arguably the best film with the word “Transformers” in the title and frees the series from its robotic shell, but that’s not saying a heck of a lot."
rotten,"In terms of personality, the Transformers still only come in two varieties: annoying and [404 error: character traits not found]."
fresh,The latest installment rises above most in the franchise by scaling back.
rotten,"This is a movie that people can definitely enjoy; with some cool action, crazy effects and solid music. It's entertaining the same way Fast X is. That doesn't mean they are good movies."
rotten,"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a movie for people who love Transformers and Maximals and don’t care about story, characterization, logic, or anything else that typically constitutes a quality motion picture."
rotten,This hunk-of-junk piece of IP commodification truly can’t be regarded with any further value other than that: a transactional piece of content.
fresh,"While not as outright fun as Bumblebee...Rise of the Beasts is still an entertaining thrill ride adventure, capturing the spirit of what it means to be a summer blockbuster."
rotten,"Programmed to follow the loud, clunky formula..."
fresh,"With such an incredible cast, and a catchy blast from the past soundtrack, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts rises Autobot heads above its predecessors despite minor failings."
rotten,A remarkable accomplishment when you consider that the film also features Pete Davidson voicing a sassy Porsche named Mirage.
fresh,"Make no mistake: the action is the star here, but it's nonetheless impressive that Ramos, who’s a versatile actor, and Fishback, an Oscar nominee, lend their talents to the proceedings and aren’t the least bit overshadowed."
fresh,"While not quite a transformation, this new reboot offers a welcome change of pace from the bombast of Bay."
fresh,"But while Steven Caple Jr. does an admirable job steering the ship, it's hard not to miss Bay's acumen for spectacle, even if it's undeniably refreshing to have lost all the other baggage his vulgar auteurism brought to the finished product.  Read More:"
rotten,"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts might be slightly better than the first five films from Michael Bay in that it actually focuses mainly on the robots instead of the human characters, but it is a step back from how good [and underrated] Bumblebee is."
fresh,"The creators of these films know that anything they do is okay, as long as the Transformers transform, and the robots fight (and of course the box office performs). This isn't a bad film in that parameter, the new humans work and Pete Davidson is sublime."
fresh,I doubt “Rise of the Beasts” will win over the franchise’s more hardened detractors...Still Caple Jr. proves to be a sharp and capable filmmaker who does a good job balancing humanity with that big robot entertainment many audiences want.
fresh,"It's no Bumblebee, but Transformers: Rise of the Beasts still manages to have some sentimental elements packed into it, all while providing fun and exciting (if occasionally bloated) action sequences."
rotten,"With zero stakes and even less plausibility, ""Rise of the Beasts"" just feels like filler."
rotten,"Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is a pointless entry in the live-action Transformers film franchise. The Beasts Wars characters are forgettable, the attempts at humor are excruciatingly lame, Optimus Prime is a huge jerk, and the action is trash."
rotten,"If you can look at these robots fighting and see anything more than a pair of unconvincing cartoons flailing at each other, your eyes must be a lot better than mine."
fresh,"'Rise of the Beasts' is the best 'Transformers' movie yet. It has all the popcorn-flavored action, good laughs and the best needle drops."
rotten,"Wait a hot minute here. Can a new Transformers movie actually be bearable? Let’s not get carried away, but a diverse cast and the absence of ham-handed former director Michael Bay qualify as a step in the right direction."
rotten,It pains me to say that Ramos and Fishback are let down continuously by a truly preposterous premise that seems to prioritise mindless destruction over any kind of plausible plotline.
rotten,A predictable return to rock-em-sock-em stupidity with nothing to add except Michelle Yeoh as a talking aluminum falcon.
fresh,"Combining forces against a planet killer to defend their adopted home, Optimus Prime and his mechanized cohorts ensure that this latest entry in the Transformers cannon entertains and emotes in equal measure."
fresh,… just a really fun action flick.
fresh,"While the seven-year-old in me still gets a bit of a kick out of the dazzling robotic visuals on display in the seventh entry in the franchise “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” the adult in me felt like seven years had passed while I was watching."
rotten,"Similar to Wan’s The Conjuring universe, Insidious has long overstayed its welcome, reaching the point where its spark has quelled and there’s nothing interesting buried within these characters anymore. We have reached the end of the Further."
rotten,"The set-up was great, but the Insidious series has lost a lot of its luster."
rotten,"Lamentably, this unusual study of family trauma and memory loss gradually loses its shine and capacity to scare.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The fact The Red Door works best as a family drama rather than a terrifying scare-fest -- to the extent that when the finale takes another trip into the Further is almost feels tacked on -- tells you it’s time to close the door on the franchise.
rotten,This latest anemic attempt at a creepy film is tripped up by a fragmented story and lackluster efforts to pass off things that jump out of the dark to an amped up musical track as being scary.
rotten,"Earlier franchise chapters featured a few smirkworthy scares and some stylish filmmaking flourishes, but The Red Door is merely an inert, boring drag."
fresh,"Wilson shows he can conjure (tee hee) some worthwhile bumps in the night as a filmmaker, and it will be interesting to see what he tackles next."
rotten,Wilson makes his directorial debut with this film that is nice enough in an anaemic way.
fresh,"Insidious: The Red Door doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors. It tantalizes us with a few effective scares, but its pacing and character development fall short."
fresh,Patrick Wilson lands some cool shots and Hiam Abass is a welcome reprieve to predictable storylines and tropes. There is a tangible gap in what might have been achieved if the red door opened through expectations.
fresh,"Akin to Child's Play 3, Insidious: The Red Door sees grown-up protagonists facing old fears. Despite some flat moments, it's an interesting final chapter."
rotten,"Patrick Wilson shows some promise for directing and delivers some genuinely well-crafted scares. Unfortunately, the story that spends most of its runtime uncovering events the audience already knows just shows the franchise shouln't have gone further."
rotten,"A disappointing entry that, sadly, spends more time recapping the previous films instead of carving its own path."
fresh,"Insidious: The Red Door plays it safe and takes it a bit too slow, but it's good performances and nostalgic scares make it worth the viewing."
rotten,"This isn't a meaningful exploration of trauma's lingering impact, the current genre go-to, as much as it wants to be."
rotten,"The fifth Insidious movie starts strong, with fresh character touches and chilling, eerily quiet moments, but it eventually suffers from a sequel's usual diminishing returns."
fresh,While not as good as some of the film in the Insidious franchise this does more than enough to suggest that Patrick Wilson has what it takes to be a decent genre director.
fresh,"I loved the father/son chemistry from Patrick Wilson & Ty Simpkins in this chapter in the Insidious franchise, though it could've been scarier overall."
rotten,"Takes the laziest of all routes, suggesting that what happened a decade ago shall happen again now in more or less exactly the same way."
rotten,"Although this fifth installment maintains its elegance, the reformulation of the genre within that veneer of modernity established by Wan in that first installment is already a long way off. Too far. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The movie doesn't lack terror and though it employs easy scares and cheap cuts, it alternates them with quiet apparitions and blurry figures that get under the skin, and an elegant use of the depth of field. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Though Wilson is working with a bland script, he does show some promise as a director as he gets what juice he can out of the material."
fresh,"Patrick Wilson' solid directorial debut offers a touching conclusion to the Lambert family saga, but he's let down by a scattershot script."
rotten,The new ‘Insidious’ chapter wearily fizzles despite some effective set-pieces and signature jump scares.
rotten,I saw nothing in it that isn't average or below average.
rotten,"This is standard horror movie stuff, but also a considered aesthetic, as Wilson underlines by all too briefly bringing on Hiam Abbass as an imperious professor who holds forth about Goya and the need to balance darkness and light."
fresh,"I wouldn't put it up there with the Conjuring movies, and I would say it's not as good as the first Insidious, but I think it's a little bit better than the last one."
rotten,It’s time to put these demons to rest.
rotten,I was mostly bored watching this. Even people who like the Insidious franchise probably won't leave with a lasting impression.
fresh,It is a bit formulaic at this point but if you’re looking for something scarier amongst the big action movies this summer this is not a bad choice.
rotten,The result is a listless journey with uninspired creature designs.
rotten,"I was neither entertained nor was I scared, but nevertheless I was impressed by the film it desperately wanted to be. Show me that film, and I’m on board next time."
fresh,"Insidious: The Red Door sees the franchise returning to the family that started it all with a few familiar demons and plenty of new ghouls. With frights on par with the first, it proves the series isn’t ready to be dead and buried just yet."
rotten,"I’d hoped that the newest Insidious would lean into high melodrama. But though there are a couple of memorable moments, the film ultimately takes itself a little too seriously to be fun."
fresh,"While the film doesn’t take the franchise to new or exciting territory, it wisely brings the focus back to the Lambert family and provides a touching examination of how the events of the past impacted the family over the next decade."
fresh,"In what is basically a string of startles, Wilson creates a sense of dread not through what is seen on screen, but what could possibly leap out of the shadows."
rotten,"A disappointing continuation of the franchise.  While it's nice to see the characters from the first two films return, the movie spends too much time reminding the audience of the previous films and not enough time moving the story and mythology forward."
fresh,"Some of the fan service to the franchise feels a bit unnecessary and occasionally breaks the ominous ambience, but with Insidious: The Red Door, Wilson has crafted a supernatural horror with emotional bite."
rotten,"I was over Insidious by the time the last movie came out, and I'm over it still."
rotten,"It is perfectly, precisely average in all departments, from the inconsistent caliber of the acting to the innocuous nature of the jolt-scare scenes."
fresh,"It is neither more nor less terrifying than any of its predecessors, and pales in comparison to the best exponents of the genre. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the performances, the jump scares, and some downright distressing situations. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"For the completists, it's a decent enough watch. For newcomers, you can follow along. For everyone else, watch the stronger entries - which is just about all of them."
fresh,"'The Red Door' doesn’t come off its hinges with its horror, but it’s easily the most emotionally felt entry. Who could say no to a father and son hugging it out? It’s sweet."
rotten,"Wilson's direction is solid, but Teems' script is lacklustre and feels inconsequential. If this is the end of the Lamberts' story, there were ample opportunities to incorporate Lorraine and Renai more or achieve a better balance between Josh and Dalton."
fresh,…all filla and no killa; the core narrative has been watered down with prequels and side-missions to the point where it’s hard to discern if we’re moving backwards or forward at all…
rotten,This is a forgettable movie that does nothing to take the franchise to new heights.
fresh,There's a strong idea here about how important it is for an artist to confront past traumas instead of blocking them out.
rotten,The Red Door has few reasons to stay open.
rotten,"None of it has much impact, despite Wilson’s best efforts to provide character-driven texture."
rotten,"Insidious: The Red Door has sentimental value going for it, but you can’t help to wonder if the lore of the world we cannot see could have been developed alongside it."
fresh,"The Red Door is a captivating exploration of generational trauma brought to life through Patrick Wilson and Ty Simpkins' performances and[...] shines with its well-crafted jump scares, beautifully haunting cinematography, and blend of memory and reality."
rotten,"Insidious: The Red Door progresses into a meandering, momentum-free midsection that generally emphasizes cheap shocks over dread and tension..."
rotten,The series' first chapter not written by Leigh Whannell — and it shows.
rotten,"Patrick Wilson puts together some nice visuals, but the story is a mess. Our main character Dalton literally has zero charisma as a main character, and his college roommate (Sinclair Daniel) does her best to offer substance but isn't held up adequately."
rotten,"Despite coming in at less than two hours, the film feels like a three-hour ordeal — a cardinal sin in the fast-paced horror genre."
fresh,"The film certainly proves that while repetition can burn out a concept, that notion simply doesn’t apply to the way Wan and Whannell’s beloved series ratchets up the tensions and preys upon our base human fear of being caught unawares."
rotten,A half baked rip off of “The Babadook.”
rotten,"While there are a few effective moments of tension throughout... they are always undermined by the fact that Wilson can’t stick the landing, resulting in a bunch of clichéd jump scares that fail to generate the sustained unease necessary."
fresh,"In the end, Insidious: The Red Door closes up its own loop satisfactorily, if somewhat sappily."
rotten,"For all the interesting performances and promising characters in this one, I think the actor/director and actor’s director lets us off the hook entirely too easily."
rotten,"While Wilson’s direction adds a spark to an otherwise bland experience, this finale feels entirely unnecessary. Certain shots will inject some semblance of fear into a lackluster story, but it was never all that scary."
rotten,"Dream sequences dot the action to confuse even devoted fans, while Insidious newbies and dabblers might wonder when Freddy Krueger will arrive. Wilson’s directorial debut is not a total failure, but neither does he push the franchise to any new heights."
rotten,Boringly offers more of the same with the baffling attempted hook of hoping everyone has forgotten everything about this series
fresh,"What we've got here is a franchise finale that, like many of the other films in the ""Insidious"" series, fails to meet its full potential."
fresh,The Red Door wears its heart on its sleeve and generates enough dread in the quiet moments to sustain it through the less-effective jump scares.
rotten,"This jolt-happy July programmer might be as dull and rusty as a nail in the coffin could possibly get without breaking apart, but Insidious newcomers should rest assured that they’ll be able to follow along with their friends’ exasperation."
rotten,"Whether or not you’ll want to push this door open may depend on how much of a completist you are. For many, leaving it shut may be just fine."
rotten,The original was one of the rare PG13 horror films that was really scary. This fifth installment just has nothing new to say.
fresh,"The Red Door isn't the best Insidious film, but it certainly had some of the best scares."
rotten,"The original was thrilling, whereas Insidious: The Red Door is simply going through the motions."
fresh,"Fans of the franchise looking for more Lipstick-Demon scares and further explanations about the mysterious Further may be disappointed but if you’re open to a lot of father-son bonding with occasional jump scares, you should be good."
rotten,"But as it’s full of uninspired original horror images shrouded in deep darkness, the film represents the lowest point in the series thus far."
fresh,"Wrapped in the instantly identifiable color palette, Autumn Eakin‘s cinematography, Adam Reamer‘s lush production design, and Beth Kushnick‘s set decoration all add components of depth that match the conviction of the character building in the script."
fresh,"Insidious: The Red Door has some wonderful jump scares, some very creepy sequences, and it gives new terror to the prospect of receiving an MRI."
rotten,"Insidious: The Red Door isn’t a bad movie, it’s just a misguided one...It feels more like a documentary about the aftereffects of the original films than a true follow-up."
rotten,'Insidious: The Red Door' isn't the absolute worst way to spend 107 minutes. I'm sure it is more fun than working in a uranium mine.
rotten,A clumsy end to an already lackluster franchise.
rotten,The leaden screenplay would be easier to overlook if there were more spooky sequences.
rotten,The imbalance between nostalgic Further ruthlessness and our waning interest in Lambert lineage secrets is frustrating to power through.
rotten,"Due to its weak screenplay, Insidious: The Red Door offers its most forgettable installment to the franchise."
rotten,You’ll have checked out by the time we’re wandering around in the astral darkness.
rotten,"Callbacks to other “Insidious” films are half-hearted, and “The Red Door” seems to give up on trying to make all of the pieces fit after a while."
rotten,"'The Red Door' makes a vague gesture in the direction of emotional resonance, but it can’t figure out what to do with its allegory beyond what’s been done more successfully elsewhere, flimsily mimicking Ari Aster with all the conviction of Neil LaBute."
rotten,"Franchise fans will enjoy seeing the Lamberts again, but newcomers will be baffled by the under-developed story and nonplussed by the over-familiar scares."
rotten,"[T]his fifth and seemingly final entry offers an extended, unnecessary anticlimax..."
fresh,"Sure, Insidious: The Red Door doesn’t do anything particularly different or exciting, but it’s a compelling thrill ride from beginning to end. It’s utterly terrifying at points, and brings the Lamberts’ story to a satisfying conclusion."
fresh,Familiarity with series tropes does little to dampen the ... genuine-adjacent ... emotion or sentiment found in the Lamberts’ struggle to overcome (now) generational trauma and reconcile themselves to the past and the choices they made.
fresh,"It’s an efficient and enjoyable spookfest of the scare-by-numbers variety, but it never reaches beyond the well-worn menu of what the franchise has already served up over the years."
rotten,Viewers should ask themselves why they would willingly shell out almost fifteen bucks for the same emotional payoff one could get from simply staring at a wall for 105 minutes while someone randomly drops breakable objects in the background.
rotten,Wilson comes at this like the star of a TV show who’s watched them make it for long enough that he figures he could do it himself.
fresh,"Insidious: The Red Door might not be the scariest installment in the franchise, but it feels a lot more human than the others before it."
fresh,"Patrick Wilson exhibits prowess as an actor and director, as the movie is peppered with many spine-chilling sequences."
fresh,"It'll probably give you the creeps on several occasions, and maybe that's all that really matters when you get to the fifth installment of a horror franchise."
rotten,"For a first-time director, Patrick Wilson doesn’t do a bad job, but he’s working with tropes that have already been worked to death. It’s time to close this carnival of souls down."
rotten,"Even with half-a-dozen decent jump scares, this PG-13 effort isn’t very frightening. Part of that has to do with a pokey sense of pacing; tension just isn’t built during long lead-ups to paranormal action."
fresh,Insidious: The Red Door is an effective end to the Insidious franchise as it is both a good calling card for actor/director Patrick Wilson as a filmmaker and a fun exercise in delivering terror for the masses.
rotten,Insidious: The Red Door offers closure but little else
rotten,"Underwhelming, repetitive and dull while low on palpable scares and suspense."
rotten,"This possible final chapter (never say never) isn’t sitting as a super high for the series but doesn’t go out on a limp, either. It goes just far enough."
rotten,"It’s softer stuff, failing to add something exciting to the “Insidious” universe, keeping this latest voyage into the Further severely muted when it comes to chills and lukewarm when it deals with relationships."
rotten,"Its characters may be desperate to remember the things they’ve willfully suppressed, but as this dud confirms, some things are best left forgotten."
fresh,"Wilson reminds audiences why they fell for the Lambert family with a sentimental sequel that tenderly bids them farewell. While it doesn’t pack in the scares, it does offer poignant closure to the protagonists that started it all."
rotten,"Insidious: The Red Door is a poorly constructed and dull horror movie with subplots that go nowhere. The movie's ending is a mishmash of lazy and ineffective jump scares. It's disappointing, because the story had potential but is badly mishandled."
fresh,"The Red Door is a solid return to The Further. An effective mix of classic Insidious jump scares, unnerving lengthier set pieces, and (a personal favorite) scares heavily tied to character."
fresh,‘Insidious: The Red Door’ is a fun and simple haunted house attraction worth the price of admission and a welcome return to its familial roots.
fresh,I thoroughly enjoyed this final chapter as it delivered the scares we deserve and allowed fans to bid farewell to these characters we’ve come to love.
fresh,"Patrick Wilson's directorial debut demonstrates an interest in form, in the plasticity of colorful and gothic dreams, that diverges from the duller aesthetic of contemporary franchises. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The story isn't compelling, the effects aren't scary, and the performances aren't credible. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Mostly plays as though someone read the outlines for three or four average horror movies and then watched a couple of episodes of Stranger Things with a bottle of gin and a mild concussion.
rotten,Enough already.
fresh,"… knocking on this door should provide an adequate, if not spectacular, final trip into the Further."
fresh,"Despite being the equivalent of a walk through a county fair horror house, this is the Insidious installment with the best executed and sustained suspense. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,All the rather meticulous work on the conflictive father-son relationship gives way in its second half to a cascade of ornate nightmares and diabolical apparitions that do not add much... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,The long-awaited direct sequel to Insidious: Chapter 2 is a tepid supernatural-horror disappointment.
rotten,"Open the door, don’t open the door…we fail to care and wish the other dimensional demon would put us all out of our misery."
fresh,"...there's an alluring quality to Manodrome, even if it’s not explored entirely, that provides enough ammo for a thought-provoking watch. And combined with a solid cast [...], it’s a movie that deserves a lot more recognition than it’s gotten initially."
fresh,"While it's far too intense, the film's pungent energy holds the interest. But some fresh air might have allowed the story to breathe more meaningfully, because it has a lot to say."
rotten,"Manodrome lacks depth as social commentary or character study, largely because of how it positions us in relation to its protagonist’s perspective."
rotten,"An ambitious, unpleasant, and ultimately unsuccessful examination of toxic masculinity and cult mentality, this dark drama gets by for a long while on Eisenberg's aching, physical performance."
rotten,"Jesse Eisenberg is fantastic, even if the movie itself is rocky."
fresh,"[It] ends on its least hyperbolic note, to graceful, even somewhat touching effect. But until then, it piles on contrary devices, some of a ripped-from-headlines ilk, without creating the organic character inner life or narrative that might unify them..."
rotten,"The cast gives their all, but the film ultimately has nothing to offer."
rotten,Manodrome makes all the obvious moves.
rotten,"With the help of a hideous haircut, Eisenberg gives a convincing performance as a repressed loser who never discovered who he is and has officially run out of time to start. But Trengrove’s script is as directionless as his protagonist."
fresh,"It's Eisenberg who finds Ralphie in those narrative spaces, creating a whole and crushingly convincing portrait of a profoundly lost man, and the damage left in his wake."
fresh,Trengove seems determined to defy the standard solutions to this sort of mess.
rotten,"Crude and sensationalizing, “Manodrome” is like an amalgam of all the headlines you’ve read about the kinds of men who succumb to warped ideologies."
fresh,"…a hard film to love, but it’s a fearless insight into the collapsing white-male mind-set, and features another scorching performance from Eisenberg, who shrugs off the bookish, sensitive aura that has been his signature..."
fresh,"Ambitious to a fault, Manodrome does remain unsettlingly gripping throughout delving into incel culture, with an exacting, tough-to-shake performance from Jesse Eisenberg"
rotten,"Dark and initially intriguing, but shallow, unimaginative and heavy-handed. In a double feature with Fight Club or Taxi Driver, it would be the inferior B-movie."
rotten,"Sadly, “Manodrome” doesn’t remain in an enigmatic state of mind, slowly growing unwieldly the more explicit Trengove gets with the details of this unraveling."
rotten,[A] missed opportunity [that] ends up more of a Taxi Driver lite than fully embraced its premise. It’s a pity because this is one of [Jesse] Eisenberg’s best performances I’ve ever seen in a long while.
fresh,Dark take on toxic masculinity.
rotten,"The film has relevance, of course, at a time when vulnerable men are groomed and politicized, but, curiously, Manodrome doesn’t investigate that at all, preferring instead to be an well-worn melodrama with a varnish of faux importance."
rotten,The current American imagination seems utterly unable to understand acts of kindness require greater heroism than acts of violence.
fresh,"The subcultures in Manodrome are ostensibly a work of fiction but, exaggerated as they may be, are no less plausible or rife with intrigue."
fresh,"It's hallucinating and perhaps predictable, yet it never ceases to be surprising. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Best Eisenberg offering in over a decade.
fresh,A thought-provoking piece of queer filmmaking that should not be missed.
fresh,An impressive Jesse Eisenberg courts our empathy and our rage as a wounded man broken down by confrontation with the one thing he cannot fathom -- kindness.
fresh,"While John Trengrove’s skill is apparent in the slow build of tension, it also stands out in the arguably more impressive way that he holds Ralphie’s view of the world separate from that of the film’s."
fresh,A bleak and accurate depiction of the ouroboros of toxic masculinity that is only growing more fork-tongued.
fresh,"Manodrome feels like the first proper film for the manosphere, and yet it does not concern the Internet at all: no 4chan, no Reddit, no avatars nor slang."
rotten,"Lacks the emotion or insight that may have put a unique spin on this well-trodden tale. Instead, it becomes another brutal slog through the unpleasant psyche of a troubled man."
rotten,"The helmer has set out to shock and surprise, but the twists instead just feel rigged to reaffirm his own views of toxic masculinity."
rotten,"While Brody brings effortless authority to his role as the soft-spoken but creepy cult leader, the film has more or less jumped the shark by the time we get a full picture of what his retreat for wounded men is all about."
fresh,"Despite its flaws, Manodrome is still a sensible exploration of how toxic masculinity changes, shapes, and slips through the cracks while fighting to survive in a world where the patriarch is constantly under assault."
rotten,"The film’s base elements and intentions are interesting, but it doesn’t offer much in terms of original insight."
rotten,Nobody can fault Neeson for agreeing to what must have been a handsome payday for acting with just the upper-half of his body. But...
rotten,"Think Speed, minus the charm, thrills and suspense."
rotten,"Retribution may please those looking for some undemanding, familiar action. However, this particular type of Neeson formula seems as exhausted as his character."
rotten,An inoffensive but inessential addition to Neeson’s latter-years thriller canon. Less the bus that couldn’t slow down than the car that couldn’t get started.
rotten,"Some guilty pleasure thrills are what’s on offer but they are frankly annulled by Liam Neeson’s autopilot dullness, a driverless car of a performance from an actor we know to be capable of much more."
fresh,"Good films like this have a finesse about them that carries the audience along for the ride. Some moviegoers may scoff at one thing or another, but the swiftness of the film’s action returns their attention to the dangers on the screen."
fresh,"Of course, you have seen some of this stuff before, but our reliable hero still looks good doing his thing, while there are some slickly-delivered thrills to enjoy..."
rotten,"A remake of a foreign film, itself a rip-off of Speed (1994), Retribution is basically Neeson versus a maniacal GPS."
fresh,Retribution has an interesting premise that is supported by believable performances but takes it's foot of the brake towards satisfying resolution.
fresh,"Liam Neeson's classic high-stakes action meets a ticking bomb, echoing shades of 'Speed.' While the tension is palpable, deeper character connection is amiss. A thrilling, yet familiar, race against time."
rotten,"Turner [Neeson] moves unconvincingly from disengaged husband and father to have-a-go hero, making this perhaps the least watchable of the actor's later-life action films."
rotten,Retribution is another underwhelming entry in the Neeson Season that follows middling films such as The Marksman and The Ice Road. It delivers nothing more than the bare minimum of Liam Neeson’s watchability.
rotten,"Suspense and vicarious thrills can be fun. That’s why Hitchcock films remain popular. But Retribution, the latest family-members-are-in-danger-and-it’s-up-to-Dad-to-save-them movie starring Liam Neeson, offers 91 minutes of anxiety without the fun."
fresh,"Efficiency is an underrated virtue in thrillers, and while there's not a lot that's new here, the basic emotional through-line - why is this happening to me, how can I keep my kids safe, how long before I can get revenge - is refreshingly solid"
fresh,Brace yourselves for a shock: Liam Neeson’s latest action movie is actually quite good.
fresh,"Neeson’s one job here is grip the wheel, grimace intensely and bellow as belligerently as he can into his Bluetooth headset without upsetting his children. All of this, he does most convincingly."
rotten,"In what could have been a tense race-against-time action thriller, Retribution suffers from a limp storytelling."
fresh,"Another day, another family in peril, although Neeson’s latest interchangeable rescue mission is not without popcorn thrills."
rotten,It started strong and looked promising... But then it just degenerated.
rotten,It is suspenseful and the car chases are good -- except for an utter abdication of reality.
rotten,A tired ticking clock thriller with a generic story that delivers few thrills. Even the biggest Neeson fan is going to leave the theater disappointed.
rotten,It's as if someone built a computer model of the most intense Liam Neeson expressions and uploaded them to a ridiculously inept and lifeless action picture that hangs on the parody of the actor's performance.
rotten,"When you don’t have a horse in the race, you can admire the form but the results don’t change your life. A near miss, but a miss nonetheless."
rotten,"Liam Neeson -- try as he may to make me question my life choices, I will always remain loyal to his unapologetic gruff vulnerability on the big screen. But by crikey Liam, you're not making this easy for me."
rotten,Retribution takes a flying start but ends up being a one-time watch affair due to its shortcomings and execution.
rotten,Hooked me at first but threw me back in with the finish.
rotten,Neeson appears to have landed in this movie without being entirely convinced he's the right person to reprise this role once again. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"We do kind of get an idea of how irritating it would be to be stuck in a car with a bomb under your seat, two kids in the back, and a voice insisting you follow vague and confusing directions."
rotten,A repeated formula can sometimes become tiresome. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Standard fare thriller.
rotten,"The new thriller Retribution is the nadir of the Neeson industrial complex of low-rent thrillers. Or maybe it’s the ideal version of this kind of film? Either way, he sleepwalks through the motions, to the point that this role barely requires him to move."
rotten,Behold the remake of an original movie... that wasn't that original to begin with. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Doesn’t slam down hard enough, passing on the simple pleasures of insane escalation to become a mediocre B-movie with a star who’s no longer interested in standing."
rotten,"From the get-go, the movie tries to emulate Speed (1994)... but it never succeeds in making us empathize with any of the characters it puts forth. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Neeson has become such a pro at this that he can make a stressed-out guy in a wired-up car thrilling enough.
rotten,"I’d recommend Retribution if the weather is too hot and you want to spend a few hours in air conditioning. Otherwise, it’s a pass."
rotten,"What we have here is a lethargic thriller, with little to no ideas, which pales in comparison to the Korean version, and I assume, also in comparison to the original Spanish version. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"The best adjective I can think of to describe this film is “efficient.” It gets the job done, much as one would expect."
rotten,"Retribution has reasonable tension and is capably acted, but the overall experience feels like a tired retread."
fresh,Retribution is a one-time watch that will keep you engaged until the end. But the story and twist take away from the drama and prevent the movie from being as impactful as it initially promises.
rotten,There are so many ways that this could have worked but none are adopted by the filmmakers.
rotten,Liam Neeson brings his usual macho intensity to this otherwise ludicrous thriller that’s as generic as its title.
fresh,"This is a high-tension, sit on the edge of your seat movie with not a dull moment thanks to good writing, directing and the acting skills of our three main characters."
rotten,"Matt can park the car every so often to catch his breath; he just can’t get out. This is a writing decision that robs the film of any possible chance at gaining momentum, and also perhaps best exemplifies Neeson’s career over the past decade and a half."
rotten,"Retribution is not the worst of his thrillers/action movies, but it does suggest that Neeson may want to consider retiring from the everyman action-hero beat for good."
rotten,“Retribution” is a boilerplate thriller undone by some eye-rollingly preposterous plot elements.
fresh,"Director Nimrod Antal and writer Christopher Salmanpour don’t reinvent the wheel; indeed, the whole exercise pivots on creating an excuse to put Neeson behind it and, essentially, leave the driving to him."
rotten,The only jaw-dropping this thriller induces is yawning.
rotten,Talk about being  taken for a ride.
rotten,"Time to put this one in “park,” it’s on E."
fresh,"With a simple idea, a handful of characters, and a compact running time, this speedy, high-concept action/thriller does its job exceedingly well, handily smoothing over any inherent ridiculousness."
rotten,I'm bitter and grumpy about this movie.
fresh,It all feels like it’s been shot in live traffic. Kudos to the cinematographer and editor for that.
rotten,"Neeson’s gravelly brogue and measured demeanor are at odds with the film’s frantic state. He seems so ill-suited for action heroism, maybe it was a relief that he just got to sit in a car for this one."
fresh,"This is a paycheck movie, to be sure, the kind of direct-to-video title that gets a theatrical release because the lead actor still has star power. But he and his director have earned that paycheck."
rotten,"A film so devoid of thrills, excitement, or purpose that it seems to have been custom-made to play in empty multiplexes during the traditionally dead last weeks of summer."
fresh,"Retribution is comically familiar, yet that familiarity breeds comfort for the average movie watcher who wants something not too complicated."
rotten,"Unintended laughs, cringe worthy dialogue and a toilet paper plot reduce the latest Neeson thriller to an embarrassment."
fresh,"While there are moments when you wonder if you are in a Zucker Brothers spoof of Speed, Retribution (a remake of the 2015 Spanish film El Desconocido) manages to keep you engrossed"
rotten,"Neeson gives us a bit more to chew on here than his standard hunt-for-his-daughter/avenge-his-son fare, an actor who lets us see the panic, see the wheels frantically turning and who never shies away from letting us see him sweat."
rotten,This Liam Neeson vehicle has no motor.
rotten,"Another routine action programmer—doubly forgettable, because he [Neeson] does the whole thing sitting down."
rotten,Watching Liam Neeson finally attempt to escape the car bomb is mildly entertaining; there’s just a mediocre movie to sit through first.
rotten,"With Neeson’s latest, Retribution, he finally gives up in a tired thriller that barely asks him to do more than fasten his seat belt."
fresh,"Sleek and efficient as a jaguar, this Liam Neeson vehicle comes up with a simple, singular premise and then floors it."
fresh,"“Retribution” is the kind of solid, economical crime drama we don’t see that often anymore in favor of bloated spectacles. It’s rather satisfying to see Neeson, a master at being brave and tough, save the day so efficiently."
rotten,"This all continues for 91 minutes total, and even with that short running time it starts to feel awfully long because we have all seen variations of this gimmick in so many movies."
rotten,"Here, Hungarian-trained helmer Nimrod Amtal (Predators) feels like he’s just going through the motions, offering little innovation or inspiration, as he trades heavily on Neeson’s ability to switch between serenity and going seriously postal."
rotten,Starts out better than average but goes downhill pretty quickly.
rotten,"“Retribution”, a movie with too many unmissable flaws to qualify as good, but with just enough of that tried-and-true Neeson formula to keep you involved. At least for one viewing."
rotten,This movie should be called Liar Liar Pants On Fire.
rotten,Retribution ... clearly doesn't know what to do with its promising setup.
fresh,"A flawed thriller, Retribution is nonetheless a real treat for those more inclined toward mise en scène than character or narrative plausibility."
fresh,"It’s vaguely surprising this is a theatrical release when its scope is closer to a Grindstone Entertainment Group production. Yet also efficient enough that you don’t really care, and proof Nimrod Antal has pulled off an invisible achievement-of-sorts."
rotten,Retribution lacks the direction and style that typically elevates the material. I’m not saying that Liam Neeson needs to stop making movies like this. Maybe he takes a break.
rotten,"For a movie about a guy trying to save himself and his kids from a car that might blow up at any moment, it's curiously low on thrills and complications."
fresh,"If we’ve truly lost the collaborations between Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra (who’s still a producer here), I’m entirely ready for the rise of Neeson and Nimród Antal."
rotten,"“Misdirection is at the heart of every great magic trick” is a line uttered with sincerity and confidence in director Nimród Antal’s Retribution, a movie that unquestionably has no magic"
rotten,"Ultimately, the narrative is never engaging, indulging in a sluggish momentum that is rarely captivating."
rotten,Even this many empty calories will take you only so far.
rotten,"When will this genre escape its own tropes of sepia-tinted skies, italicized poster fonts and titles seemingly chosen by plopping a finger onto a page of the Old Testament?"
rotten,"Neeson is dependably good, although the movie itself is generic and silly."
rotten,"Liam Neeson offers glimpses of gravitas. But if the options are, to quote the slogan of his Mercedes Benz, the best or nothing … you can guess where this one lands. As movies with explosives in vehicles go, it's not ""Speed."" It's just a bomb on a bust."
fresh,"Another Liam Neeson action-thriller scores points for adrenaline-filled tension, if not originality, playing a dad trapped in a car with his kids as a faceless killer threatens to blow them up."
rotten,"It arrives in theaters the last week of August, which is the moviegoing equivalent of desperately scanning the faces at a bar just before closing time."
rotten,"The cards and the cast of players may be different, but the stakes, given the way the game has been played over and over again in the past, are low."
rotten,Slowed by ludicrous dialogue and obvious plot turns...
rotten,"The action-thriller is formulaic and obvious. In other words, it's just another Neeson movie, nothing more, nothing less."
fresh,The film’s 90 minutes whiz by.
fresh,"Neeson’s last few action flicks may have been just for fans, but “Retribution” is for everybody."
rotten,"Without a compelling reason for us to care about the people inside the car, a reasonably diverting journey never accelerates into an outright thrill-ride."
rotten,It feels like the type of movie destined to play on TBS — something dads fall asleep to when ballgames are rained out.
rotten,Eternals the movie suffers from the same thing The Eternals comic did — it focuses more on a concept than it does on characters.
rotten,The Eternals is a jumbled mess because it has to include the origin story plus detail the long lives of the 10 major characters.
fresh,"Chloé Zhao‘s Eternals is Marvel’s most philosophical film to date, teaching us about evolution, humanity, love, and the nature of good and evil."
fresh,"Chloe Zhao’s Eternals   is a triumphant! A slow burning story that was epic in nature, beautiful in character development, & Brutal when in its action scenes. So many thoughts, so much ambition, but truly something that the MCU hasn’t seen yet."
rotten,Eternals has its moments but its massive scale never allows the characters to live in their world.
fresh,"Chloé Zhao still follows some of Marvel's success formulas, but her unique style brings new attributes to the cinematic universe, such as the distinctly gorgeous cinematography and the profound themes of faith and humanity."
fresh,"There are plenty of good ideas here, singular moments to love and appreciate. But at the end of the day, the writing for Eternals trips itself up."
fresh,"Ultimately, Eternals is a superhero movie for people who don’t like the usual superhero fare. It’s far more concerned with grand emotions and the thin line between hero and god than it is with quippy one-liners and over-the-top action."
rotten,"As a whole, it’s somewhere in the middle; and I hope it’s not the last time Marvel allows a prestigious director to take a shot in the MCU and give a bold take on the formula, flaws and all."
fresh,"We've seen lots of heroes fight for revenge, duty, honor, glory or adventure, but rarely love which is a prime motivating force for all of us."
fresh,The narrative is simultaneously too large and too small. With personal relationships defining the narrative of a cosmos spanning opera ... As far as MCU goes though this isn't a terrible direction for them to explore.
rotten,"[Chloé Zhao’s] Marvel debut is the opposite of anything she’s ever done — she has created something stale, repetitious, and heavy-handed. I’m sorry to say Eternals is a massive disappointment."
fresh,The result is a beautiful look into the joys and sorrows of humanity that also doubles as an entry point into some of Marvel’s stranger cosmic storytelling.
rotten,"I couldn’t help but think of how it would have fared better as a Disney+ streaming series. There’s very little here that screams big screen movie, and giving the characters and their stories more room to develop would have helped tremendously."
fresh,"Eternals is a jam-packed, ambitious and oddly imperfect addition to the Marvelverse."
fresh,"Eternals may be one of the weakest Marvel movies yet, but there is still enough to enjoy as it propels us into a new and uncertain future for the franchise."
rotten,Chloé Zhao tries to shove a sappy essay on the virtues of mankind and the value of loving humanity despite its flaws into a lackluster superhero journey of ten vapid characters who spend the entire film disproving her theory.
fresh,ETERNALS is love! Chloé Zhao has created such a beautiful film. Her superheroes are awe-inspiring supernatural beings and at the same time so deeply human.
rotten,"We have to wonder what kind of movie Zhao would have made left to her own devices. We suspect it would have less CGI monsters and more ruminations on character, immortality and watching humanity evolve."
fresh,Its a beautiful film to watch with visually stunning sequences worthy of the big screen experience.
rotten,"A film that takes an age to arrive at a familiar place. Yes, there are a plethora of new terms, species, and legends to learn, but it all boils down to heroes preparing for the big battle at the end. Its visually impressive, but missing the sense of fun."
fresh,"An interesting storyline in the Marvel Universe that in my opinion, proves how the status quo just might miss the most impactful reason comic books existed in the first place. In my view, comic readers will likely appreciate this movie more."
rotten,"Hampered by too many characters, the plot is equally underdeveloped beyond the major beats."
rotten,"""The harder this intermediary, conceptually fascinating Marvel chapter veers from the familiar, the harder it collides with the guardrails of frustrating MCU formula."""
rotten,"Mind you, it is one of the weaker MCU outings, but is it really inferior to some of the Iron Man and Thor entries?"
rotten,"Writer and director Chlo Zhao, who won an Oscar for Nomadland, has given audiences a plodding, nonsensical film bereft of feeling and action."
rotten,Zhao ultimately robs the artist’s comic of its sweep by constantly turning a space opera into a repetitive character drama.
fresh,"Eternals is driven by a love story. One between lovers, duty, and legacy. Throughout the 157-minute runtime, viewers will have their eyes glued to the screen and rediscover what it means to be excited about something original."
rotten,"Marvel Studios' Eternals is a rare misfire. However, it has a few redeeming qualities. Chloe Zhao had some clear ambition, but the film fails to come together with likable, meaningful characters or a truly engaging plot"
fresh,"With Eternals, Disney seems to have settled on a galaxy-spanning villain that could hang over the entirety of their Phase IV efforts, but the film might just feel too obvious to entice the legion of franchise fans to their latest lengthy story arc."
rotten,Eternals is as good as it could have been. The issues stem from the source material and the movie acts as a huge set-up for what's to come.
rotten,Eternals is nothing short of a disaster.
rotten,"Though there’s definitely some fun to be had with this film beyond Zhao’s glorious compositions, Eternals ends up being one of the more overwrought and, frankly, silly additions to the MCU canon."
fresh,"Eternals, which boasts the most diverse Marvel cast to date, may not be to everybody's taste-particularly those who find comfort in tradition."
fresh,Eternals is a really hard one to rate. Thinking about it although I enjoyed a lot more of it than I didn't I don't know if I'll ever feel like watching it again...
fresh,"Eternals is overly ambitious in some areas, but it has plenty left to explore and improve going forward."
rotten,"In two and a half rather long hours, the only thing I find is a boredom as infinite as the universe with the politically correct origin story of these Marvel's Power Rangers. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,It's not until the heart of the second act that we're totally immersed in the plot with its twists and the direction it is going to take from there. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"In the MCU, even the not-great movies are reasonably entertaining, and worth a watch. Eternals is the rare franchise entry that's a major misfire."
fresh,"Eternals is a celebration of humanity, warts and all."
fresh,"The abundance of story, characters, and world-building can be overwhelming, but Zhao approaches it brilliantly. Nanjiani saves this film for me."
rotten,Eternals is stuck between a rock and a hard place. It is too blatantly commercial to take advantage of the studio's new prestigious filmmaking talent and too outside the box to satisfy Marvel's audience.
fresh,"Eternals pushes the envelope both visually and narratively, taking the superhero franchise to new and exciting directions. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It doesn't have one remarkable element, performance, scene, or moment in its two and a half hour running time that made me think I was watching something marvelous."
rotten,"Eternals offers too much interesting stuff to be dismissed as ""bad"" outright, but it's frustratingly uneven."
rotten,"In snatches, it gives us a genuine moment of visual specificity that works but it cannot keep up the weight of all the questions and implications that it depends on. If it must be all things to everyone, then it ends up being little unto itself."
fresh,"Eternals is far from perfect, but it pushes the MCU into promising new territory....it feels like an amalgam of what Marvel does best - splendidly chaotic fight scenes, dazzling special effects, and stories that speak to who we are as human beings."
rotten,...a completely misguided and misbegotten piece of work that stands as the absolute nadir of both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Zhao's filmography...
rotten,"But at this point, the MCU formula has been recycled so often that sitting through these movies starts to feel eternal."
rotten,It is an okay movie but the characters didn't grab me and the -lot was too drawn out.
rotten,"The only thing ""super"" about Eternals is its ability to cure insomnia."
rotten,"Well, they can't all be winners. With the arrival of Chloé Zhao's Eternals, somewhere Alan Taylor, director of Thor: The Dark World, is breathing a sigh of relief; he's no longer responsible for the worst Marvel film."
fresh,"Eternals is a beautifully made, well-acted film with characters I can't wait to see more of."
fresh,"Eternals takes aim at some cool ideas and concepts, and it mostly delivers..."
fresh,Zhao is quite literally providing us the best of both worlds as a result. Eternals simultaneously feels like an MCU film and a prestige picture with everything that entails.
fresh,A thoughtful and earthy epic that dares to ask big questions and acknowledge its characters' weaknesses.
rotten,A philosophically dense film that stagnates under its own considerable weight as it dances through 7000 years of world cultures while never quite finding its groove.
fresh,"""Eternals"" isn't a terrible Marvel movie, just an average one. Considering the talent at work, and the potential of such a world-changing set of heroes, it could have been so much more."
rotten,It's baffling how low-energy Eternals is. It looks like a film made by people who work in an office.
rotten,Eternals is a slow-paced affair that runs too long and never quite delivers heart-stopping moments.
fresh,"Eternals makes for an alienating first watch. ... Dig a little deeper, however, and this behemoth of a superhero flick has its rewards too."
fresh,... everything fans expect from Marvel Studios while still feeling a bit hollow... fuel for the imagination... angsty and lovelorn but adds few revelations to the who-wants-to-live-forever trope...
fresh,This movie needed better marketing as it was an epic drama with superheroes in it. The comic relief was very much needed because this was a pretty slow movie.
fresh,"There a solid performances, beautiful cinematography and decent story that was better than I expected. However this film felt and was incredibly long..."
rotten,It comes with all the childish nonsense over superheroes you get from juvenile comic books.
rotten,"Academy Award Winner Chloe Zhao's ""Eternals"" is not good, but unlike the slew of increasingly tiring and formulaic Marvel fare there are some bright spots."
fresh,"Without a strong human-level side to balance it all out, big concepts are just lifeless words and images."
rotten,Tedious. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Eternals is just as ambitious and argumentatively dispersed as the original comic series. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Good without being great, Eternals is an enjoyable but bloated push into Marvel's cosmic comics catalogue."
fresh,An epic that feels far smaller than it should.
fresh,"Chloe Zhao has made a flawed film, it's true, though it's bursting with beauty and ambition. It's possible this might be the best-looking film in the MCU, and Zhao gifts us with strong cinematography and numerous shots of gorgeous vistas."
rotten,A more than two and a half hour pompous and leaden film. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Zhao brings her flair for the beauty of the eye shots over vast landscapes...and it still delivers on the celestial plains of epic proportions. It's a cosmic opening for the next phase of the Marvel saga.
rotten,"It's a frustrating, occasionally fun, at points brilliant, frequently tiresome journey that never manages to reach any of the potential it so clearly had."
fresh,This one captured my eye as well as my intrigue for this continuing storyline in ways I had not anticipated
fresh,"Introducing a dozen characters and establishing their backstories in an already busy plot is a heavy lift. Director Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) skillfully juggles all these elements, making an understandable 2.5 hour movie that covers all the bases."
rotten,"What might have been a fascinating interplay of psychologies and ideas, is rendered in broad, lifeless strokes."
rotten,Eternals is somehow Marvel's most ambitious movie and also its worst.
rotten,"Eternals is dull, it's boring, and it's quite epically uninvolving."
fresh,"Taking up space in such a well-mined universe can't be easy, but Eternals not only manages to hold its own, but delivers something engaging, unique, funny and warm."
rotten,"The one exception to the film's utterly bloodless chemistry is a cameo by a post-credits pop star who, for all of 15 seconds, has a completely charming interaction with a CG creature. I believed that performance more than anything in the 2.5 hours."
rotten,"Bring in the portentous overreach of the Eternals' cosmos-shaking storyline, though, and her talent is diminished. For Zhao, bigger is not better."
rotten,"At its best, this is galaxy-brain, comic-book stuff rooted in a tactile sense of place."
fresh,Eternals has a lot of heart and beauty that drips off the screen when you watch it.
fresh,"For a movie with ten protagonists, it's impressive that each character is given a unique personality."
rotten,"Clearly, we're supposed to leave the cinema filled with an urgent sense of anticipation. But all I felt was relief that the two-and-a-half hour running time had finally come to an end."
fresh,"Chloe Zhao maintains a terrific spark in the character interaction, and the plot has some thrilling twists and turns."
rotten,"Chloé Zhao's take on the Marvel Universe is a far cry from her last film, Nomadland. While Eternals has its moments, it is not one of the Marvel greats."
rotten,The enthralling action set-pieces have to be parsed from in-between awkward moments in which characters stand around waiting to explain themselves. The wildly inconsistent tone moves from laugh-out-loud to deadly earnest...
fresh,"Eternals represents the kind of grand, open-hearted home run swings that Hollywood should be more willing to embrace."
fresh,"Those who have followed Zhao's meditative, self-reflective work will know that her language of communication is a blend of deep silences and aching words."
rotten,"Despite being 2 hours 37 minutes long, Eternals feels rushed, like it's trying to squeeze a ten-episode series into one feature film."
fresh,Zhao's approach can feel like a director at war with the very nature of the material she has been hired to direct.... Eternals can still be admired for its chutzpah.
rotten,An ambitious mess and a fascinating failure
fresh,"It mixes melancholy with violence and humour, styles clashing, the artsy vs. the ""Marvel way,"" with cartoonish digital creations and all. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,The Marvel shill on this podcast approves and it's sure pretty enough to admire even being a big leap.
fresh,"Eternals isn't a complete success, with issues large and small. That said...it's an impressive effort. This is a BIG swing, and while it might not be a home run, we're looking at some solid contact. For an undertaking like this, that's a win."
rotten,"A slack film, in the way one gets to be when one has no pressing need to come in at a reasonable running time."
fresh,"The long and short of it is that, yes, Eternals is a colossal bore...for those lacking patience, heart, and imagination."
fresh,"On the whole, the film succeeds in becoming the series' most emotional outing."
rotten,Eternals creates the illusion of a maturity that would have elevated it to director Chloé Zhao's standards. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"None of the characters come across and compelling...yes, these being are supposed to be immortal, but you'll feel as if you're time with the Eternals has lasted for an eternity."
fresh,Chloé Zhao deals with real world themes that resonate now and will only resonate more as the MCU continues to evolve.
rotten,"Eternals is not a good movie. It's not a good comic book movie, it's not a good action movie, it's not a good Marvel movie. It somehow feels overstuffed and empty at the same time. It's muddled and convoluted. It's a bland and boring and bewildering mess."
rotten,"Eternals is a mess, a beautiful mess, but a mess nonetheless. There is a far more interesting movie under all that flotsam. In better hands, the movie could have been something special. All Zhao has provided is a bland, dull film."
rotten,"I came out disappointed having witnessed an imbalanced, slightly messy, uninspiring, and sadly boring slog."
rotten,"For all its flaws, it is far from the worst entry in the MCU, but it is, perhaps, the first of Marvel's films to be less than the sum of its parts."
rotten,"In many ways, what it means to be human is the central question that drives Eternals... But the movie's dizzying star power and twisty backstories render it too clunky and overstuffed to concisely answer said central question."
fresh,"I really enjoyed Eternals despite it being too long, and one of the reasons was the humor. Another was just that it felt kind of quirky and different from most Marvel movies these days."
fresh,An exciting peek into the future of the franchise....with grander ideas and new types of storytelling.
rotten,"Marvel is the peanut butter of movies, Zhao is the filet mignon of directors, and I just wasn't fully enjoying my peanut butter steak."
rotten,It's not that none of the movie works. It's that none of it works for very long.
rotten,The MCU's first DCEU film.
rotten,"Gorgeous and vacant, The Eternals is the most numbing entry in Marvel's 13-year-old MCU franchise -- even as it struggles to be its weirdest and most philosophical."
fresh,"Exciting, yet exhausting introduction to a new set of Marvel superheroes with an emphasis on eclectic diversity and familial inclusion."
fresh,"Eternals is not perfect for the stumbling beginning and Jolie plays a character that doesn't seem fully fleshed out on screen. She doesn't quite fit in. But overall, it's one of the best MCU experiences for it's eccentric and endearing characters."
fresh,"Eternals is a flawed experiment years ahead of its industry but, sooner or later, a film has to break the mold and prove superheroes are worthy of deeper, richer cinematic retellings."
fresh,"While it has big special effects scenes, it's not a formulaic Marvel film. While there are certainly typical action scenes, the movie digs deeper into the dynamic of multiple layers of relationships and dark human drama."
fresh,Eternals offers plenty to embrace...the overall production is just not effective enough to move into the upper echelon of Marvel films.
rotten,"Dougherty had a gorgeous diamond that he just needed to polish with a rational, simplistic story, like it was a soft, clean cloth. Instead, he used a hammer…"
rotten,"I’m going to have to deduct some points for the score, sound, and script issues..."
fresh,"Michael Dougherty has delivered a Godzilla movie that is unquestionably action-heavy, probably too much for those with no affection for the classic creature-features."
rotten,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters has done an effective job of making larger-than-life creatures completely inert, and any popcorn-munching fun that might've come from such a show has been reduced to a dismissive shrug."
rotten,"Strong action, weak dialogue unfortunately."
rotten,"...exceedingly, distractingly slick..."
rotten,"It's difficult to know what could make Godzilla: King of the Monsters a truly enjoyable film, but a start would be to focus on what everyone wants to see - the monsters - and leave the tricky plot mechanics for pretty much any other movie."
rotten,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters is in 3D - Death, Destruction and Decibels - but has a certain kind of cheesy appeal."
rotten,"And listen, it's ridiculous. Godzilla: King of Monsters attempts to pack in so much bang, you forget why the fighting started in the first place. It's an action film on steroids."
rotten,"If you're happy to sit through scene after scene of utter nonsense to get to the next sequence with giant CGI creatures biting each other, then Godzilla: King of the Monsters may be for you ..."
fresh,The story is a little bit of hollow it's a little bit orced... but - big but!- Godzilla makes up for it. The return of Godzilla and all of these friends is pretty amazing and pretty epic.
rotten,An epitomic example of bombastic spectacle unable to overtake terrible storytelling.
rotten,A surprisingly dull affair as far too much time is spent on a truly ridiculous plot involving the freeing of Godzilla's rivals and far too little on epic monster throw downs.
fresh,"After a subpar 2014 effort, Mike Dougherty keeps the focus on the monsters during this sequel, which makes for a lot of fun and a breezy pace."
fresh,"Doesn't make a lick of sense, but it has a lot of fun along the way."
rotten,"It is full of hollow characters that escape without scratching from any explosion, foreseeable situations that cause me to yawn and sequences of mass destruction that never leave redundancy. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"King of the Monsters is a solid, powerhouse kaiju story that even manages to find the time to make us like a couple of the human characters as well. That's a win in my monster book."
fresh,Don't let naysayers put you off - Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a lot of fun and a bombastic salute to the franchise's history.
rotten,"It's a never-ending assault on our visual, auditory, and common senses."
fresh,"Everything my soul needed: kaijus mercilessly destroying each other, destruction, an epic music score, cheesy lines, and beautiful cinematography. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Godzilla: King of the Monsters ... [amps] up the monster action and even [gives] us a framing plot that's just as good as Kong and better than the one in Godzilla.
rotten,"Each monster, each crash, and each blow are so isolated that the film doesn't feel light on its feet but void of weight instead."
fresh,I'll say this is probably going to be one of the best event movies of the year. It succeeds in the scale of what this movie should be and what fans hoped it would be.
fresh,"Legendary Pictures seems to have heard the outcry of audiences everywhere and have seen fit to produce Godzilla: King of the Monsters, a film that knows no sense of the word 'restraint.'"
fresh,"Sure it's campy and a bit goofy but it's the right direction for these films and the right audience to target since Godzilla belongs to the monster kids, both young and old."
fresh,"What matters is if this sequel to the disappointing 2014 American Godzilla gets the monsters right. And for me, it does."
fresh,Sometimes you just have to let go of rooting for the humans and root for the monsters instead.
fresh,The monster fights alone are worth seeing on a huge screen. Just don't go looking for a realistic plot or science.
fresh,"As the puny humans flail, Godzilla, the Cary Grant of giant monsters, emerges with his dignity intact."
rotten,Godzilla: God of the Monsters fails to deliver on the promise of an epic monster film.
rotten,The film even has two comic relief archetypes: Bradley Whitford as the freaked-out white scientist and O'Shea Jackson Jr as the phlegmatic black soldier ... Everyone - and everything - in this film is reduced to their basic tenets
fresh,The sound effects in this movie are extraordinary. That roar that Godzilla does? I gotta tell you that I kind of love that. I might make it the dial tone on my phone.
fresh,The real reason to see Godzilla: King of the Monsters is its gargantuan monster brawls - the biggest put on screen maybe ever.
rotten,Godzilla: King of the Monsters delivers killer kaiju - but at a cost
fresh,"This Godzilla sequel packs an overwhelming punch with awe-inspiring moments of creativity and compelling storytelling. It is well-rounded, not only in its casting, but in its ability to make you feel a wide array of emotions. Go see it, go now."
rotten,"It's not a good time or aesthetically pleasing or even very exciting. There are two or three fantastic apocalyptic images, but that's about it."
rotten,"It feels like overkill. Too many under-developed characters populate the story, too many plot points are crammed in, and the special effects are bludgeoning."
rotten,"With its mind-numbingly dull action, flat characters, and nonsensical plot, it's rather difficult to find a single redeeming quality in the entirety of the two-hour tedious mess that is Godzilla: King of the Monsters."
fresh,This prompt sequel barely survives its loud need for displaying stuff on screen. It's no follow up story. It's more of a MonsterVerse launch. [Full review in Spanish].
fresh,...there's enough here to keep kaiju fans hooked for at least one more outing.
fresh,Nevertheless I mostly enjoyed myself though this installment definitely lacks for personality.
fresh,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters is an incredibly fun continuation of the franchise, and one that respects and honours its roots."
rotten,GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS never knows [what type of movie they are telling] and tries throwing all sorts of dead-end plot threads and ineffective emotional beats at the audience.
rotten,This is the sort of film that'll make you think cinema is dead.
fresh,"This is a film that fixes some of the previously problems in this universe. But, it also makes some new mistakes. But, I was never bored and it absolutely delivers the action, mayhem, and destruction you want from the genre."
fresh,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters doesn't hold back on the big monster fights, and it's definitely the best Godzilla film to date from Hollywood."
rotten,Godzilla [King of the Monsters] is a mostly pointless in-between instalment before the inevitable King Kong/Godzilla showdown to come.
fresh,Maybe it's time to include Godzilla in the discussion of our richest cinematic franchises.
rotten,The cast is stacked with otherwise brilliant actors stuck in a borderline incomprehensible plot and forced to play second fiddle to monsters whose powers of wonder wear off fast.
rotten,"It's not very pleasant to look at, it invests way too much in the character arcs of its blank cast, and it still does the thing the 2014 film got dinged for."
fresh,"[Maintains] the saga's general good standard, which is forgotten with the same ease with which it is enjoyed. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,A beautiful and stimulatingly coherent film with the soul of the kaiju eiga. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,It is never clear what the objectives of the characters are in a panorama that is so cliche. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Sometimes you have to be honest about the movie you really are - smashy smash. If you can reconcile that, then it's not so awful."
rotten,"It's typical of the film to set up a major sequence in which flying monsters Mothra and Rodan dog-fight, only to cut that short and follow Mark as he struggles to open some airplane doors."
fresh,"A legion of typically insightful detractors have somehow surprisingly blasted Godzilla: King of the Monsters for leaning too hard into the humans and away from the creatures. Maybe it felt that way to some, but it's literally just untrue."
rotten,"Full of chaos that is neither stimulating not overwhelming, but just confusing. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The rest of the film doesn't work, but there's enough monster combat here to make it all worth it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"In the same vein as the 2014 film, I'd argue that the human characters in this movie have the charisma of a wet sponge."
rotten,"The real titan here Vera Farmiga, who harnesses her acting prowess to superheroic heights in the role of Dr Russell trying to force some sort of emotional resonance and sense from this thing."
rotten,This movie is STOOPID.
rotten,"It is all one monster mash with humans running around hysterically while spouting lines in no discernible plot. How in the world did Kyle Chandler, V]era Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown end up in this mess!"
fresh,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters has plenty of flaws, but it delivers where it counts, thanks to stunning creature designs and spectacular fight sequences."
rotten,"Somewhat predictably, that message has been diluted over the decades - to the point that here, the use of nuclear weapons is celebrated as a good thing, with nary a hint of subtlety or solemnity about their repercussions."
rotten,"Seems not even a giant, radioactive reptile can carry a creature feature on his own any more."
fresh,"While not as thematically rich as its predecessor, King of the Monsters dials up the Kaiju action as it delivers stunning visual action sequences that will please most fans."
fresh,"Will satisfy those looking for a giant-sized monster bash, yet it's the human element that weighs down this colossal titan from becoming king of the monster movie."
rotten,"It's MonsterVerse franchise fodder, heading toward Godzilla's confrontation with Skull Island's giant gorilla King Kong."
fresh,"...it's all just marking time until the main event, which is Godzilla battling King Ghidorah at Fenway Park."
rotten,Bigger isn't always better and that's absolutely the case with this monstrous disappointment.
rotten,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters is comparable to 2014's Godzilla and far superior to 1998's Godzilla vs. Ferris Bueller. When it focuses on the marquee attractions, it roars to life. At all other times, it's merely Godzilla with a zzzz."
fresh,"Contrivances come from [putting] everyone in the perfect [plot-specific] place. The ""why"" of those actions, however, is consistently steeped in what we know of their nature."
rotten,"Alas, even as an empty spectacle intended solely to focus attention on the coming main event, the results never satisfy."
rotten,Godzilla itself looked incredible...but too much humans...
rotten,"While you get a lot more monster action than before, the key lesson from five years ago has yet to sink in: We do not care about the human drama."
rotten,"... a derivative example of spectacle trumping substance, filling the screen with incoherent mayhem while taking itself way too seriously."
rotten,"Jarringly choppy, under-developed and relentlessly cliched, the material underserves its fine cast of actors and never creates anything terribly meaningful from its titanic line-up of creatures."
fresh,Godzilla remains a political monster.
rotten,"What is needed here is not reproduction, but rather reinvention: an American-targeted Godzilla film rebuilt from the ground up."
fresh,"The actual battles are highly satisfactory, even if no one gets to shout, ""Destroy all monsters!"""
fresh,"Those of you who grew up with Creature Double Features, who yearn to see these new incarnations of Godzilla, Mothra, Ghidora and their ilk back on the screen? I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
fresh,I thoroughly enjoyed director Michael Dougherty's Godzilla: King of the Monsters. It made me smile.
fresh,This is the word of the Lord. Thanks be to Godzilla.
fresh,"Dougherty at least recognizes the opportunity he has to throw us into a world of beasts fighting each other, destroying everything on their path, and takes full advantage of it [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A noisy movie with a couple of exciting or visually arresting moments, but also with a lot of filler and gratuitous content. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It must have been tough, saying lines that make no sense in a story that is incomprehensible; I imagine them all - Dance, Hawkins, Watanabe - at the bar each night, trading bonkers lines of dialogue they'd had to say that day, as a kind of drinking game."
rotten,"Despite the talent from Brown, Farmiga and Chandler, the story is a simple succession of cheesy events. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a monster movie that feels like a restaurant that gets your order wrong. Thanks for more monsters but I requested to hold the unnecessary human drama.
rotten,"It's bad enough director Michael Dougherty squanders the scenery-chewing Charles Dance, we also have to endure the human slice of dry white, crustless bread that is Kyle Chandler."
fresh,"Godzilla: King Of The Monsters is just a relentless haze of destruction throughout, a creative decision that obviously brings with it an enormous amount of pros and cons."
rotten,It's just a big-budget waste of resources that weakly attempts some eco-warrior gibberish and leans heavily on disaster movie clichés.
rotten,"Stuffed between the monster fights is a finger-wagging ecological conundrum, a globe-spanning chase, and a kitchen sink family drama, all of which are as tedious as they sound."
rotten,"Godzilla: King Of The Monsters presents such a preposterous and idiotic plot, that even those with expert knowledge of the franchise might find it impossible to follow."
rotten,"There is such a clear disdain for the human element in Godzilla: King of the Monsters, one wonders if there wasn't a way to make this sequel with monsters alone."
fresh,"What I got was something admirable, beautiful, bombastic, but in the way of itself too many times."
fresh,'Godzilla: King of the Monsters' will go over big with fans.
rotten,"Godzilla: King of the Monsters ultimately collapses under its own weight, the result of trying to do too much all at once. It'll scratch your giant-monster-fighting itch, but don't expect much else."
rotten,The CGI creatures impress--a star is reborn in Mothra...It's just unfortunate that the picture as a whole lumbers a lot like its forty-story star.
fresh,"Most of the human-focused portions of the movie are bad, but at the end of the day, I was here to see a super-charged Godzilla fight other giant monsters and I got what I came for on that front."
fresh,"As Godzilla: King of the Monsters combines its stunning aesthetic with a relevant eco-centric message, the movie carves a niche into the Godzilla franchise that's completely worthwhile. The best Godzilla film made in Hollywood without question."
rotten,"[The movie] overcompensates for not enough Godzilla. The fights are very cool, I have to admit, combined with the best special effects money can buy...but what makes it very difficult to sit through is just how loud it is."
fresh,It's an agreeably entertaining mess of a summer spectacle that nevertheless delivers the kaiju mayhem.
fresh,"Since King of the Monsters only exists to get audiences to see Godzilla vs. Kong in 2020, the attempt to be something more than just a loud, dumb bridge to the next episode is appreciated."
rotten,"The worse it gets out here, the more desperate it gets in there. Godzilla: King of the Monsters suggests it's hell out here. It's not wrong."
rotten,"While there are exciting moments to be had, the underwritten human characters and murky fight scenes add up to an underwhelming experience."
fresh,"If you're wondering if Godzilla: King of the Monsters lives up to the spectacle, the answer is yes. And honestly, what more could we want from it?"
fresh,This film turned back time over 20 years for me and I was a child again being exposed to a whole new world of action and excitement.
rotten,Godzilla: King of the Monsters clutters its narrative with too many loose strands of plot while failing to let its title character shine.
rotten,It's just as lifeless as you feared.
rotten,It's a shame that the dramatic elements don't elevate the film. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,This is one of the most incoherent movies I have ever seen...and the most aurally assaultive I can remember.
fresh,Its flaws are hidden within the good narrative dynamism that makes the film entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"I was never an aficionado of Japanese monster movies, but this overstuffed turkey makes me long for the original imports I saw as a kid. Two hours wasted: that's how I feel."
fresh,One of the notable things about this sequel is its impressive performances. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Honestly, I'd love to be able to say that in Godzilla: King Of The Monsters I saw some sort of grand cinematic homage at work... That's what I'd like to say, but unfortunately I can't."
rotten,You'd probably get the most out of this film with your eyes shut.
fresh,This Godzilla is at its best when casually obliterating lost underwater cities and holding forth on Hollow Earths.
fresh,"When put up against other movies, Godzilla: King of the Monsters isn't going to land anywhere near the top of the list. But when compared to similar films in the kaiju genre, it's a grade A effort."
rotten,"The big improvement from the last picture is these battles are visible to audiences, rather than shrouded in darkness and quick editing... But there's not a lot more to praise in this movie."
fresh,... a monster disaster film intended for the biggest screens packed with a cheering audience watching a string of money shots framed like a murals in a museum.
rotten,"Boasting a fantastic cast, with two charming, compelling leads in Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, Paul Feig delivers a lighthearted, festive film, but stuffed with cliches and a twist that doesn't quite work."
rotten,"I now finally have my own The Brown Bunny. I hated Last Christmas. The lazy, peculiar, and out of left field twist has no justification. It simply doesn’t work."
rotten,The bad news is that Last Christmas doesn’t have much in the way of a story outside of that one lyric. It all adds up to an odd little film that kind of works and kind of doesn’t.
fresh,"It'll become a Christmas tradition for you, and you'll get to tell folks you liked it before it was cool."
rotten,[Last Christmas] works a little too hard to add substance to the genre.
fresh,"It's funny in an unchallenging way, moving because of its real-life context and comforting because you always know exactly what's coming next."
fresh,"Last Christmas gives you its heart, and you probably won't want to throw it away..."
rotten,…(a) screaming festive nightmare…
rotten,"Last Christmas is like most holiday movies - something that makes you feel good in the moment, but destined to be forgotten before the year is done. Even the hook of a George Michael soundtrack can't make it last."
rotten,"As the film progresses, you can feel the twist waiting to drop ... You just don't know which rom-com cliche it's going to be. Turns out, it's all of them, and when it's revealed, it is very hard not to imagine Nora Ephron turning in her grave."
rotten,"Last Christmas wanders around listlessly, unmoored from laughs, almost as if it's been made as revenge against anyone who's complained about [Feig's] penchant for improv-based indulgences."
rotten,"Part Curtis-style rom-com, part George Michael jukebox movie (note the title), part personal redemption tale and part mystery story... Put all this together and it's no surprise that the movie is something of a mess."
fresh,"Clarke's first big post-Game of Thrones move is heavy on inclusivity and morality lessons but loses no sense of humour in the process, dodging preachiness with ease."
fresh,It's worth seeing with family and girlfriends and moms and besties because it's a smart happy movie you can laugh with without feeling dumber for it.
fresh,"Last Christmas fortified my cynicism for more than an hour, then Clarke eroded it just enough to make me like it."
fresh,"Yeah it's predictable and a little formulaic, but Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are such a whimsical duo - delivering on the laughs and the tears."
rotten,For all its unoriginality there is something inherently likeable in this fondue mess.
fresh,"I personally enjoy Emilia Clarke's spirited performance the most. She's clearly the scene-stealer here. The supporting cast is just as fine, particularly Michelle Yeoh and Emma Thompson as Emilia Clarke's Kate's boss Santa and Kate's mother Petra."
rotten,It did not click... It's not Love Actually.
rotten,"Its heart was in the right place, it just wasn't there there."
fresh,The combined charms of Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding do a lot to ground the film in a place that feels real and not too quirky.
rotten,"It's likely to become a Christmas classic, but for all the wrong reasons."
rotten,A Hallmark movie mixed with the forgettable drama Seven Pounds.
fresh,"There's nothing deeply original about Last Christmas, and some viewers may find its familiarity irksome. But I found it pleasant and even a little touching, early-season Scrooge though I am."
rotten,Too bad that the final sequences try to be magical and ends up in no man's land. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Still, it's frequently funny and rarely annoying - just sort of genteelly charming."
rotten,"It gets better, which is to say it gets more insane and stupider."
fresh,"...truth be told, in the tumultuous times we are currently going through, a couple of hours of mindless fluff is just the tonic you need."
fresh,Last Christmas breaks through the mold of typical romantic comedies with a dramatic edge allowing you to forgive its sluggish pace in the middle of the story.
rotten,Poor chemistry on the screen among the protagonists. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,It's part of the end-of-year cynicism to tack on something marginally seasonal to a bland piece drama and call it a movie for the holidays - and Last Christmas is unoriginal in that way. A piece of forced Christmas cheer with no real purpose.
fresh,"It's fairly silly and predictable... However, this Christmas-themed rom-com also contains a legitimately touching message of goodwill and self betterment."
fresh,Paul Feig films the romantic comedy clichés with grace. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Listen, I like Ghost as much as the next person, but the internal logic of the final act twist is all over the place."
fresh,[It's] a star-studded romcom that plays like an expensive Hallmark film.
rotten,"[There's] a ""surprise"" twist capable of making M. Night Shyamalan, the king of realism blush. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Paul Feig not only films with great elegance the fun encounters and disagreements between a radiant Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding, but also takes the opportunity to honor Ernst Lubitsch's movie The Shop Around the Corner. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"While Emilia Clarke is lovely, Last Christmas generally fails to make a connection and is much too busy"
rotten,"[T]he first half of the film is shockingly awkward, cheesy and cringe-worthy."
rotten,"Co-written by Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings and directed by Paul Feig, Last Christmas is a hodgepodge of a romantic dramedy with its big twist spoiled in its marketing campaign."
fresh,"'Last Christmas' sparkles with wit, feeling"
rotten,"Still, it's worth a visit to the multiplex to behold cinematographer John Schwartzman (National Treasure: Book of Secrets, The Founder) accept the challenge of illuminating a feature almost entirely by Christmas lights."
rotten,It's got Christmas. It's got celebrities. It's got a sappy story with a few feel-good moments sprinkled in. It just doesn't work.
fresh,"Uplifting, quirky film full of sweet surprises. This holiday themed romantic comedy uses singing, humor and mystery to remind us all to appreciate the foibles that make us different and the humanity within us all."
rotten,"Last Christmas had all the right elements, just all the wrong execution. Leave the kids and possibly the teens home for this one."
rotten,A busy muddle that doesn't pursue any idea for longer than five minutes.
rotten,I don't want to be the Christmas grinch this early in the festive season but Last Christmas isn't the Love Actually we've been looking for.
fresh,"It's a really cute holiday movie. It's charming, it's silly, it's funny, goofy and full of George Michael/Wham! music."
rotten,"The movie pulls off the bizarre feat of being both predictable and ridiculous at the same time. Emilia Clarke shines in this otherwise mediocre Christmas rom-com, and she's the one thing preventing this movie from being completely unbearable."
fresh,"From the eager performers, some nice cameos, to the overwhelming use of Christmas decor, the heart of the film there is an enjoyable moviegoing experience to be had."
fresh,Last Christmas' tolerable vibe is due almost entirely to Clarke's almost impossibly likable turn as the troubled central character...
fresh,"It's super Chrissmassy, with echoes of Dickens and much else besides, and though ragged around the edges is made watchable by fine performances and George Michael's winning, wonderful songs."
fresh,"It's a fascinating mishap of a display, but one that held my attention in ways that better films haven't this year. In a word? Grand."
rotten,"Last Christmas is patronising, illogical and silly."
rotten,"A London-based romcom full of George Michael hits, Paul Feig's movie seems designed for people who think Love Actually needed a bit more whimsy."
fresh,"You don't want to spoil it - it's silly, but satisfying as a plum pudding."
rotten,"Well, all I can say is that all that talent doesn't quite come together, as they all, no doubt, imagined and hoped."
fresh,"In my list of movies I will watch every single Christmas, alongside Love Actually and Home Alone."
fresh,"While it doesn't feel particularly Christmassy, I still felt better walking out of the cinema than I did going in."
fresh,"Love and life are pain, the glitz and sparkle of Christmas are but a momentary reprieve from it, and everything is pretty much unrelentingly awful. But Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding are adorable!"
rotten,The music of George Michael and Wham! is hauled out on to the soundtrack of this mouldy tangerine of a movie with about the same level of care and sensitivity that you might find on the festive mixtape at a motorway service station.
fresh,"Clarke is wonderful, running around in a bright green elf suit with jaunty pointy-toed shoes showcasing a wild abandon that only grows more captivating as things progress."
fresh,Last Christmas is so adept at capturing the spirit and warmth of the season that the obvious twist honestly wasn't even needed to stick the landing.
fresh,"'Last Christmas' is a romantic comedy that should be on everyone's must-see movie list. Fun, charming and adorable. Emilia Clarke as Kate is perfectly cast. The film also has a welcome tribute to George Michael."
rotten,"The film looks terrific, though the bravely bananas twist doesn't work. Michelle Yeoh is fantastic - Santa the Christmas shop boss is the tart lemon in a festive citrus fruit bowl."
rotten,It's hampered by way too much rom-com cliché and cutesiness.
fresh,"I will watch this movie for many, many holidays to come; a reminder that sometimes small acts of kindness can make patches of the world a bit more bearable."
rotten,"It's heart is in the right place, and it breaks my heart to say almost everything isn't."
rotten,"A ""Notting Hill"" ""Love Actually"" Sixth Sense"" smashup that makes everything seem borrowed from a better film."
rotten,"Last Christmas isn't quite a careless whisper but by the time you get to the bonkers twist (you have been warned), you'll need to get someone to wake you up before you go-go."
rotten,Readymade to play on an endless loop on Freeform's 25 Days of Christmas ... Last Christmas is as flimsy and disposable as holiday wrapping paper with just as much substance.
rotten,An utterly transparent third act plot twist and the seemingly incidental use of George Michael's music turn Last Christmas from pleasant enough to utterly empty.
fresh,"Emilia Clarke can do comedy as well as tame dragons, and does the role of Kate the loser, quite well. Her quips and pratfalls are numerous and carry the story along."
rotten,a load of old baubles
rotten,"Believe me, you won't thank someone for waking you up before you go-go. You'll wish you'd stayed in bed."
rotten,"A mostly pleasant film, until its last act. Gotta have faith, charm, music... but also a much better script. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"...long and slow...Mostly it's writer Emma Thompson preaching with an accent from hell, and it's tedious, to say the least."
rotten,"Last Christmas wants to be a crowd-pleasing balm for an England mired in Brexit, but the occasional cruelty of its humor echoes the ignorance and cynicism that gave rise to Britain's stalled break with the EU in the first place."
rotten,At least half of the dialogue sounds like someone held the relevant actor's family at gunpoint and ordered them to speak random words.
rotten,"A whitewashing attempt by the Chinese Communist Party to sneak their vast, illegal, live organ-harvesting trade into our collective subconsciousness via the Trojan Horse vehicle of an innocuous-looking X-mas Rom-Com, using two popular Asian movie stars."
rotten,It's built on a concept so creepy and wrong that I fear George Michael's spirit is in for a very un-merry Christmas.
rotten,"This movie is bad. It's so bad. But what's great is that if it's even a modest hit, it could inspire a whole cinematic universe of movies loosely based on George Michael songs, and ""Father Figure"" would be weird as hell."
rotten,"Like Kate, Last Christmas is unequivocal in its appreciation of Michael, but it fundamentally misunderstands the daring individualism and self-deprecating wit that underpinned his best work."
rotten,"The sad truth is that Last Christmas fails as a romcom, as social commentary and as a showcase for its impressive collection of talent, even if it still just about passes as a Christmas movie."
fresh,It's a bit of a mash-up (and not always in a good way). It's also genuinely heartwarming and adorable. It's very much the kind of movie that gets lukewarm (to lousy) reviews but leaves audiences feeling quite satisfied and even a bit weepy.
fresh,"Last Christmas makes up for its flaws with a deeply funny script, a sense of great fun and holiday charm, and a terrific performance from Emilia Clarke."
fresh,"It's hard to resist, even for people who know better."
fresh,A seasonally appropriates crowd-pleaser - with a poignant twist.
fresh,Last Christmas touches your heart and jump-starts your holiday spirit.
fresh,"Still, the 'good will to all' theme ensures that Last Christmas, for all its syrupy stylings, has its heart in the right place."
fresh,"Despite some of the film's hiccups, though, Last Christmas is a very enjoyable holiday film with just the right amount of humor, sap, and the fantastical elements that make Christmas films so damn charming."
fresh,"Despite the rom-com shortcomings, Last Christmas is a sweet tale of redemption that features enough heart & festive aesthetics to kick off your Christmas rewatches."
fresh,Last Christmas is so full of charm and goodness - especially from Clarke - that you forgive it all the cheese and unsurprising plot.
fresh,The script certainly wears its heart and its politics on its sleeve and Feig takes every opportunity he can to showcase Michael's more heartfelt tunes.
rotten,It's almost like... no one has any idea what they're doing at all and just praying that the association with a classic Christmas pop song will pull them through. It doesn't.
fresh,There's a certain odd charm to Last Christmas that elevates it beyond the standard holiday date-night fare.
fresh,"Clarke plays a warrior princess on Game of Thrones, but as she proves here, she may be the most winsome comedic actress of her generation. Even when the story lags, she lights up the screen with her crinkle-eyed smile."
rotten,"Despite Emilia Clarke's best efforts, Last Christmas is manipulative, questionable and honestly just plain wacko."
fresh,'Last Christmas' will keep you in the holiday spirit at least.
fresh,"This isn't a tale of finding love, it's one of learning to love. And in that, it succeeds."
rotten,You'd be better off asking Santa for a lump of coal in your stocking than wasting money on this mess of a movie.
rotten,"Emma Thompson, last year's breakout star Henry Golding, and Emilia Clarke all flounder in this sedate, uninteresting, unfunny, and downright unromantic Christmas tragedy."
rotten,[A] lugubrious exercise in muddled storytelling.
rotten,Too light to be a serious discussion of its heavier themes but too morose to be a lighthearted holiday romp.
rotten,"Easily forgettable and highly contrived, the music of George Michael is never used strongly enough to make the film soar."
rotten,It's as if the writers have created a character too neurotic and too unlikeable.
fresh,"Last Christmas is an unabashed, human, romantic dramedy. This is less Spy and more Love Actually. There are those of us who love movies like this... the emotion, the crying, the fantasizing about falling in love in London over the holidays"
fresh,"Emilia Clarke is a darling and Henry Golding is as charming as ever, but Last Christmas does play out like a traditional romantic comedy."
rotten,"This romantic comedy doesn't wind up spreading much holiday cheer, instead settling for predictable crowd-pleasing formula with only the slightest of twists from the norm."
fresh,"Clarke's bright smile and willingness to play the fool or the jerk will serve her well, in what could be a promising career as England's next rom-com icon."
fresh,If you hold on... it'll just about break your heart.
fresh,"Even so, this familiar and formulaic holiday tale has its pleasures, unless your name is Ebenezer - and in the end, even he was mollified."
rotten,Leads have no chemistry. Jokes lame. Twist painful. Ho-ho-no.
fresh,"Last Christmas doesn't have quite enough romance to be considered a true rom-com, but it's filled with a charming, heartwarming holiday spirit."
rotten,"Instead of skipping merrily into the holidays, it awkwardly trips over its own twinkle toes."
fresh,"Last Christmas winds up being simply okay. It may not satisfy as a romance, but it's got all the Christmas decorations you'll need to see for the season."
rotten,"It all builds to a big holiday singalong, but the cheer is absent. The song ""Last Christmas"" will endure. The movie, not so much."
rotten,"Though Clarke and Golding are charming with chemistry to boot, there's isn't much they can do with the film's shallow script."
rotten,"Has the ingredients to be a holiday classic, but it feels half baked with cliches and an illogical twist that frustrates more than delights."
fresh,Feel free to indulge those too-sweet holiday cravings; just remember to brush afterward.
rotten,"A stilted and accidental farce, Meg 2: The Trench has laughable dialogue driving a film centered on some of the worst big-budget computer-generated graphics this year."
rotten,Sharknado with a bigger budget.
rotten,"The title may suggest that this is a sequel to the 2018 global hit, but its content hints that the makers swiped a fistful of script pages from such deliberately dopey efforts as Sharknado, Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus, and Sharktopus vs. Whalewolf."
rotten,"With so much more going on besides meg lunching, this somewhat unlikely sequel will stretch an audience’s patience."
rotten,"There's an enjoyable disdain for empathy as extras get munched, though mostly it's just not that exciting, and B movie tropes that should evoke knowing enjoyment seem simply dull. The green-washing makes it worthy, if not see-worthy."
rotten,... An irritating moviegoing experience and certainly the worst movie of the summer. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"What’s perhaps most damning about this big dumb shark movie, however, is how little it actually pays attention to its fine finned friends."
rotten,"delightfully absurd and not quite as good as you’re hoping it might be, partially because the special effects are so uneven, ranging from the genuinely impressive, to the cartoonish"
fresh,Definitively edible. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Just as “Meg 2” fails to work as a serious, scary shark thriller like ‘Jaws,” it also lacks the camp appeal of “Sharknado.” Instead, it’s stranded at sea, somewhere in the middle, and even appealing tough guy Statham can’t save it."
rotten,"It offers a throwback to the kind of no-brainer formula genre thriller that used to be par for a summer’s moviegoing course, but now seems a bit out of place."
rotten,"The filmmakers are more than comfortable with the writing team either overlooking any scientific inaccuracy in Steve Altern's source novel, or in adding their own logic-defying scenarios, including that meeting of the megalodon and Tyrannosaurus..."
rotten,"Unfortunately, one must make it through most of the movie to reach this fun, chaotic conclusion."
rotten,"more sharks but no bite ... Statham, also an executive producer, returns as diver Jonas Taylor, but he seems bored. Or miserable. His performance has a grumpy flatness, not even the winking humor of THE MEG."
rotten,"Wheatley dishes out pedestrian CG FX, frames Statham in a few heroic poses and careens his way to a third act that plays as if the writers saw how people praised the third act in the first movie, so they just rewrote it."
rotten,"Doesn't deliver on the fun of the first film and instead leaves us drowning under all the movies it wishes it was. The cast is game and, well, that's about it really. Guess you could say it...lacks real bite."
fresh,"Unembarrassed about its own absurdity, The Meg 2 delivers amusingly over-the-top aquatic mayhem by the bloody bucketful."
rotten,Ben Wheatley is a good director. The Meg is dumb fun. This toothless sequel is neither good nor fun.
rotten,"Something, something, something. Chum, chum, chum. This shark tale is dumb, dumb, dumb."
rotten,"It's a relief, after almost two hours of this silliness, to come up for air."
fresh,"It isn't terribly sharp, but it's fun."
fresh,"All hail the biggest, meanest, sharkiest diva of the ocean."
fresh,"May not be everything I wanted The Meg to be, but it's certainly a step in the right direction."
fresh,"If you go into Meg 2: The Trench expecting a good, fun action film then you won’t be disappointed. While the boundaries are pushed a little more this time this is still just pretty much Statham vs some massive sharks… and there is nothing wrong with that."
rotten,"There's some superficial fun to be had, but there's absolutely nothing clever or original about the film.  I get that it's dumb fun, but this feels like they're going for the bare minimum."
rotten,"Meg 2: The Trench doesn’t live up to its predecessor in almost any way: Its first ninety minutes drag, it’s clunky, strangely confusing, and simply doesn’t have enough shark to justify even its under two-hour runtime."
fresh,Eventually stops taking itself seriously and becomes the movie it's meant to be.
fresh,"...it might be the metaphorical Citizen Kane of brain-dead, expensively upgraded Syfy channel-style sharksploitation that flatters China."
rotten,"When the shark is no longer the main threat or focus of your shark movie, you've lost your way."
fresh,"The exceptional 3D quality of this movie, and the goofy action, are the main reasons to see this movie. 3D haters and other pirate viewers may not care for it, since it does take some time to get much traction."
rotten,A film that darts from one scene to another without much tension.
rotten,"While the sequel partially embraces its absurdness, there are still far too many annoying human characters and poorly developed plot points. While the action-filled climax is a delight, too much of the first two acts doesn't work."
rotten,"Meg 2 promises to deliver over-the-top thrills, but this sequel is as lifeless as its characters, and the payoff at the end is not worth the egregiously long buildup."
rotten,…we probably shouldn’t be surprised that a franchise dedicated to the idea of shark jumping should jump the shark of credulity at the first possible opportunity…
rotten,"While there are undeniable instances of magic, there are just as many unintentionally laughable ones right along with them."
fresh,Delivers just what it promised - a lot of shark chomp[ing action.
rotten,"Sharks, krakens, and dinosaurs, oh my! (yawn)"
rotten,"Attempts to bite off its 2018 predecessor by going bigger in every way, but rarely for the better. It’s a clumsy action movie with the occasional spurt of fun monster conflict amidst a sea of flat characters and a tiresome plot of corporate espionage."
fresh,"Once they finally make it back to the surface, The Meg 2 actually starts to open up and become genuinely stupid fun."
rotten,Another offering in the Sharknado franchise would have been more appealing.
rotten,What's all most astounding about this is that it's directed with zero panache by Ben Wheatley.
fresh,"It is just as big, dumb and deliriously free of all commonsense as its predecessor, and just as much guilty-pleasure fun."
fresh,"It does pretty much what you expect from a movie like this, but even bigger and splashier."
rotten,"...not as catastrophic as fear, it is only a bit boring.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"While the image of Jason Statham on a jet-ski throwing harpoons with bombs attached to a megalodon might be an appetizer to your B-movie craving, you are never fed a full meal."
fresh,"Meg 2 jumps the shark of action blockbusters and sci-fi, prioritizing pure and hard entertainment above physical and biological laws, narrative logic, and common sense. And it is delightful. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Not that anyone is required to try, but no one can stop Meg 2: The Trench's most apt line from proving oh-so-true: ""this is some dumb shit""."
rotten,...suffused in a darkness that’s compounded by a surfeit of lackluster characters and several poorly conceived and executed action sequences...
rotten,"All chomp, no romp."
rotten,"It's exactly as advertisted: a big, dumb shark movie. It does have fun moments but this one borders more on Sharknado territory than it does Jaws."
rotten,"For a franchise that revels in ridiculousness... devoted to satirizing the quirks of past shark movies as they do actually provoking scares, the most ridiculous thing in them is positioning Statham atop the narrative food chain."
rotten,"“Meg 2: The Trench” is an Act Three movie in that it finally gets to the good dumb stuff in its finale when Wheatley, his sharks, and dinosaur-like mega lizards tear up a place called “Fun Island.”"
fresh,"If giant sea monster mayhem is what you’re looking for, it’s got you covered."
rotten,"This isn’t nearly as much fun as it should have been, but Statham’s presence ensures that it remains watchable, even if it never quite delivers the shark-based thrills or craziness you’re hoping for. Eat more people next time, sharks!"
rotten,"If Wheatley were inclined to release Meg 2: The Fun Island Cut, there’d be a lot more here to recommend. As it is, the film’s dead in the water."
rotten,"Alas, Meg 2: The Trench, based, like its predecessor, on Steve Alten’s hit novels about hungry megasharks, bellyflops and bores."
rotten,It’s almost a crime to be boring when your premise is a cult action star taking on a prehistoric creature. Meg 2 should have been the good kind of bad.
fresh,... The nutritional version of the abundant giant monster features that pop up every year in China. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Meg 2 is a series of unfortunate events that is so non-stop that it will exhaust even the biggest action enthusiast.
rotten,"For a moment, The Trench became the funniest comedy of the year. But then, as it reached the second half, it was as if the film saw me having a good time and took out its jester fit, unaware that I was laughing AT it, not WITH it."
rotten,"Failing to capitalise on the charms of its leading man or the fun of its premise, Meg 2: The Trench is a shark sequel lacking considerable bite."
rotten,Meg 2: The Trench's special effects are hit or miss with some of them being huge misses.
rotten,"Viewers might also find themselves in need of oxygen assistance by the end of Meg 2: The Trench, a film that never takes a breath to luxuriate in or prolong the suspense."
rotten,"This franchise needs to be buried at the bottom of the Atlantic for a couple of decades, along with some illegally dumped nuclear waste. Perhaps then it might finally mutate into something entertaining."
rotten,"It tries way too hard to win us over – as though it were begging us to like it. It takes a familiar formula and botches it, resulting in one of the more forgettable movie going experiences in recent memory."
fresh,"Wheatley, a filmmaker who’s proven an ability to wield cruelty with witty precision, is forced here to straddle a neither-nor space. And you can distinctly sense that strain."
fresh,Meg 2: The Trench breaks the surface for terror and entertainment even as dialogue and story fall by the wayside.
rotten,Sharks + Statham = Tedium?  Who’d a thunk it?
rotten,"It's almost impressive how lame these Meg movies are. You have some of the coolest creatures ever, big budgets, Jason Statham; yet the films are still so boring to sit through. Remarkable stuff."
rotten,"A tiny improvement over its predecessor, this giant shark sequel sometimes seems to be reveling in its own B-movie-ness, but it also falls victim to lazy turns of plot and routine action."
fresh,"If the special effects aren’t quite up to gazillion dollar standards, Meg 2 can be forgiven. In fact, that’s part of the fun. The film has no pretensions. Watching giant CGI tentacles burrito wrap terrified tourists is highly entertaining."
rotten,"Hopefully, this sequel will sink into the trench from whence it came and nothing else will surface in its wake."
rotten,"The monster sharks, octopus, squid and weird amphibious dinosaurs cannot rescue the film from the abysmal depths it plumbs, and neither can Jason Statham"
rotten,"Dark, murky, and nonsensical, this tepid sequel fails to work as an action movie, a shark movie, or a send-up of either."
fresh,"The first half passes in a brain-deadening blur of visual illegibility so incomprehensible it's almost impressive. Thankfully, the second half delivers the bonanza of bugnuttery it was born to be and that segment's creature comforts are many."
fresh,"Meg 2 is a textbook blockbuster sequel in all the best ways. Stakes are higher, creatures are bigger, characters come back and references are made to the previous film...just go see it!"
fresh,"Meg 2 is confident in its schlock, piling on one ridiculous conceit after another at such a pace that the audience can’t help but be swept up in it. That is a harder needle to thread than many filmmakers seem to think -- it’s not enough to just be stupid."
rotten,"It makes the original look like, well, Jaws by comparison."
rotten,"Meg 2: The Trench doesn’t overly mess with that formula, but it does muck up the simple strengths of the story with all kinds of unnecessary side plots. In the process, the film goes from Shark Week to shark weak."
rotten,If you can slog your way through the first hour the movie turns itself around and delivers the fun you expected.
rotten,"Save for a few inspired silly set pieces in the third act, this is a disaster that belongs at the bottom of the trench"
fresh,"There's more, more and more. More Megs. More problems. More ludicrous plot points, more cartoonish villains, and more dialogue cheesier than an overripened Brie wheel left out on a picnic table. But also, in the film's saving grace, more Jason Statham."
rotten,"Meg 2 often fails on a basic molecular level, sometimes leaving us unclear as to who’s doing what to whom onscreen."
fresh,"Meg 2: The Trench is better than the first film because, while it repeats everything the first film did wrong, it improves on everything it did right."
rotten,Meg 2: The Trench knows what made the original entertaining. It simply chooses not to resurrect that quality until it’s almost over.
rotten,"A wildly uneven effort, spending as it does most of its time as a dud of an action drama and the rest as a rapturously unhinged action comedy."
rotten,"The dialogue is truly dire. The heroes say stuff like, “We’re a strong group, we can do this!” A baddie gloats, “We’re making so much money it ceases to have meaning!”"
fresh,"Director Ben Wheatley gives the summer blockbuster the finger, and it’s the funniest damn thing I’ve seen this year, a satirical pummeling of commercial cinema. Wheatley hits all the wrong buttons in the right ways. Who knew that was even possible?"
rotten,"Meg 2, by design, is a completely anonymous bag of lukewarm McDonalds – it’s hard to be mad at it, but only because nothing in it stands out enough to get mad at."
rotten,"Scene to scene, jump scare to jump scare, Meg 2 gets a D-minus for clarity."
rotten,"Wheatley's wit seems pointed at the gauche desires of an audience who just want some big, mindless entertainment without being judged for it."
rotten,"One of the dullest films of the year, a plodding, poorly made giant shark movie that inexplicably lets the giant shark take a backseat to an evil underwater drilling operation."
fresh,"The story is completely bonkers, but it packs more bite, unlike the lackluster carnage from “The Meg,” and understands its B-movie sensibilities."
rotten,"It is tempting to say that The Meg 2: The Trench ""jumped the shark,"" but the image of jumping over a shark suggests much more effort than the creators of this inept, insipid and straight-up boring sequel actually put into it."
rotten,"The film’s simple premise and various action set pieces should have resulted in Meg 2: The Trench being a hugely enjoyable summer shark movie that’s both gruesome and exhilarating. Instead, those involved ended up biting off more than they could chew."
rotten,[It] feels like a dollar-store version of The Abyss.
rotten,"With so much world-building and tech-savvy save-the-oceans maritime stuff heaped into the first hour, it feels like filmmakers gave up on any second hour plot details to start the frantic swimming and screaming; hey, it worked in the first movie, right?"
fresh,... a garden-variety action film with self-aware shark elements.
rotten,"Wheatley’s follow-up, however, drags mainstream narrative incompetence down to deeper, previously unimagined depths... and instead recreates the lowlights of Eighties straight-to-video action hokum."
rotten,"Every character is a stock type, every line of dialogue is a cliché, and every set piece is either altogether uninspired or derived from a movie we’d rather be watching."
fresh,"“Meg 2: The Trench” is basically a thrill ride designed to make you jump and scream every time someone gets attacked, or chased, or chomped."
rotten,"It's boring, and believe it or not, it doesn't have enough shark. This one [Meg 2] is a complete snoozefest."
rotten,"What do you get when you try to make a dumb, fun movie — but forget to make it fun? Dumb. You get dumb."
rotten,"Ben Wheatley's blockbuster debut reduces him to an anonymous bystander in a sequel that's inexplicably weaker than its predecessor. If we get 'Meg 3,' then somebody needs to remember these things are supposed to be fun."
rotten,Meg 2: The Trench oscillates between its B-movie sensibilities and a self-seriousness unnecessary for this subgenre.
rotten,"“Meg 2” turns out to be a baffling misfire. It’s a movie that seems to have the biggest and easiest target to hit, yet it misses it on every side and from every angle."
rotten,"[T]he bar for Meg 2: The Trench was quite, quite low. The movie doesn't even meet it, though."
fresh,"Reducing the tension almost to a minimum, we are left with a unbridled spectacle that's unafraid of being ridiculous for those who are game. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Doubles down on the action but not the carnage. Not as outrageous as it should have been.
rotten,"'Meg 2: The Trench' is barely recognisable as a movie. The best thing for it is to be buried beneath 25,000 feet of ocean and never spoken of again."
rotten,"How did a sequel with Jason Statham, three humongous sharks and a cephalopod on acid end up being so meh?"
rotten,"A radical rethink is needed, that’s for sure. Anyone for Meg vs M3GAN?"
fresh,"This is a very silly concept that might be full of scientific inaccuracies, but it still manages to deliver laugh-out-loud fun."
fresh,"Despite elements that threaten to drag it down into the depths, Ben Wheatley’s Meg sequel battles a waterlogged script with playful pulpiness, delivering solid summer fin. Sorry, fun."
fresh,"Given how low expectations might have been, Meg 2 turns out to be quite a lot of fun...unspools as a nicely cranked out creature feature time killer, a big serving of multiplex chowder with lots of cheesy mega-shark action spun out to a B-movie tune."
rotten,"I don't fault ""Meg 2: The Trench"" for being silly. I do fault it for being boring."
rotten,All the moments to love in the Meg 2 were done before and done better in The Meg.
fresh,"in all its breathlessly over-the-top absurdity, this self-knowing, self-consuming artefact serves up more fun – and more fin – than the original."
rotten,For far too long it feels like just another of Statham’s many many generic action movies.
fresh,"The increase in action, humour, and Statham’s magnetic charisma carry it over the finish line. Meg 2 does exactly what it says on the tin, and really, what more could we ask for?"
rotten,I just can't stand this group and the ending is unbelievable
fresh,By the end of the film...I always find myself tearing up.
fresh,"The Family Stone flips the script by having Thad be loved and supported by all his siblings and both his parents. Nothing can compete with Diane Lane, as Thad’s mom..."
rotten,There is a lack of craft to the project in nearly every sense that sees great actors give good performances as bad characters.
fresh,"Although ""Stone"" has some problems, it's still a film that works -- thanks to a very agreeable cast."
fresh,"Remarkably for a Hollywood movie, this very entertaining comedy proves that the outward good cheer and inward bad vibes of the Christmas season can not only coexist, but amusingly feed upon each other."
fresh,"The movie feels sentimental but never cheesy: Our allegiances shift throughout, until we decide everyone deserves our sympathy, everyone has reasons."
rotten,a gob of yuletide Play-Doh
rotten,The Family Stone works hard to warm the cockles of our hearts. The cast is attractive. The sentiments are commendable. But the love Bezucha wants us to feel for the family couldn't possibly compete with the love they already feel for themselves.
fresh,I loved it.
fresh,
rotten,"The farcical elements are much too loaded to provide any real fun, and the Stones come off more as sanctimonious, politically correct left-wing prigs than enchanting."
rotten,"The movie feels a lot like slacker brother Ben: a little sloppy, mostly predictable, some flashes of poignancy and wisdom, but ultimately doesn't live up to its potential."
fresh,"What's so refreshing about Thomas Bezucha's The Family Stone is how it plays off of genre expectations and effortlessly switches back and forth between comedy, romance and tragedy."
rotten,
fresh,"Tocante sem ser melodramático, desenvolve bem seus personagens, cujas interações soam sempre reais. Além disso, o filme oscila com segurança entre o drama e a comédia e conta com um elenco formidável."
rotten,
rotten,...turns from endearing to phony even before the first carol is sung.
fresh,.
rotten,"Una comedia dramática absolutamente menor, con personajes potencialmente atractivos pero finalmente inverosímiles y estereotipados."
fresh,"The Family Stone is a movie for everyone, especially during the holidays."
rotten,"Thomas Bezucha who wrote and directed wanted it to build up to a romantic and madcap third act, perhaps a bit like MOONSTRUCK, but somehow it seems forced."
fresh,
rotten,"Direction, acting, and even the dialogue are strong -- absolutely top notch. They are the work of professionals. It's the story line that bottlenecks the whole process."
fresh,"This film is clearly a vehicle for Parker. We wouldn't want to waste all the ""Sex and the City"" steam now would we?"
rotten,"I can't deny the incidental pleasures of watching these talented players giving it their all, even in such a misguided project."
rotten,A miserable misfire that might explain why so many people take their own lives during the holidays.
rotten,
fresh,"The Stone's cruelty is a delight, especially when it turns out Parker actually is a giant loser."
fresh,"Like most family holiday gatherings, [it's] awkward and a bit loud in places, but filled with good humor and packed with familiar faces who give you a warm cozy feeling all over."
fresh,Rings true in both a comedic and dramatic sense.
rotten,...hits upon a couple of sad truths.
fresh,"In a time when even movie reviews are quick to qualify everything by perceived left or right leanings, The Family Stone's critique of those who conform their values to political dogma has pertinence."
rotten,"Go ahead--throw the first stone. Throw it right at the screen. Take aim, wind up and let the rocks rip."
fresh,The third act is marred by a moment of triteness that is uncharacteristic of the delicious and subtle complexity of the rest of the movie. Not your standard holiday family drivel!
rotten,"The romantic realignments, which come later in the film, become transparent almost immediately."
rotten,"Showered with such gifts as McAdams and Danes, Bezucha surprisingly squeezes precious few laughs out of his syrupy yuletide cider."
rotten,"A wildly uneven, poorly-written film without much entertainment value."
fresh,This is wonderful; it has heart and humor.
rotten,Let's just call it Meet the Stepmom for the Holidays and be done with it.
fresh,"One of those films that succeeds not because it surprises you, but because it does what you want it to do -- and it does so pretty well."
rotten,"So determined to pair everyone up, whether logically or not, you'd think Noah's Ark was coming to town"
fresh,"Like the character of Meredith, the film's bravado cannot mask a messy soul but should be given respect for showing up and sticking it out."
rotten,Nothing like a little poignancy to mask a distasteful Christmas brew. But Rachel McAdams is hot.
fresh,"As one of the more likable holiday films to come around in a long time, the comedy The Family Stone will also surprise you with its depth and emotional appeal."
rotten,"And here, just in time for the holidays, is a television movie all dressed like a feature film."
fresh,"The dark humor is amusing enough to suck you into the film, and the melodramatic conclusion will send you out of the theater with a tear in your eye."
rotten,The movie's stock base: pat revelations and cheap manipulations.
fresh,"Gleefully irreverent and proudly offbeat in its rhythmic mix of pluckiness and pathos, Bezucha's festive family farce is up front and center."
fresh,"One of the things I like about The Family Stone is that the characters seem real. They may have some quirks, but they're realistic quirks, not those devised by an overly clever screenwriter."
rotten,"There are just too many damn characters, with the best ones taking a backseat to the dullish love quadrangle."
fresh,"It feels forcibly formulaic and yet sort of daringly original, all at the same time."
rotten,One of those cloying familiar whacky holiday formulaic sitcom drama/comedies that is what it is.
fresh,"A terrific screwball comedy in its own right, like a more erudite Meet the Parents."
rotten,"Ultra-contrived, but delivers an important message about tolerance."
rotten,"Disappointing and ultimately irritating film that fails on several counts, despite a handful of strong performances."
fresh,
rotten,"The delightful Stone family becomes the villain, and we're left unsure whether to crow in triumph when [Meredith] flees or hope she returns with a bazooka and blows the house up. It's this moral ambivalence that makes this thing so interesting."
rotten,Just desolately average.
fresh,"It's worth two hours for those who appreciate this kind of workmanlike, low-risk drama."
fresh,"Richly satisfying, The Family Stone takes us from laughter to tears and back again"
fresh,This year's lump of cinematic coal has a diamond blazing inside.
rotten,"[The film] at times approximates the cozy hostility that can permeate real-life family gatherings. But then the movie's snap turns to sap, and edgy comedy becomes standard gazing-at-the-Christmas-tree warm fuzziness."
rotten,"Some will find it touching, some will be too weary of the plot contrivances and the smug Stone family to care."
rotten,"A feel-bad holiday film about a repellent family, with a milquetoast dad and a smug, devious harpy of a mom."
rotten,"Strangely, though, it's not an overdose of sentimentality that makes the family - - and the film - - so hard to buy. It's that most of its members are so blithely cruel."
fresh,This is one busy wannabe heart-tugger.
fresh,Indie director Bezucha has held on to just enough individuality to breathe a little life into the cliches.
fresh,The Family Stone is a lot slyer than you might expect.
fresh,"There are cringe-worthy passages and an overly sentimental structure (everyone pairs up so very tidily), but the performances are delightful, and the picture comes together."
fresh,"Thomas Bezucha applies just the right light touch to the film, layering in strong dollops of wit, wackiness and warmth, making it among the best of its type."
rotten,The Family Stone is like a festively wrapped gift box that contains that special sweater you wanted - - only in the wrong size.
rotten,"In the spirit of the holiday family saga, I cry, Uncle."
rotten,"'The Family Stone' is a cliche-ridden disaster that wants desperately to be a holiday tear-jerker, but mostly pushes all the wrong buttons."
rotten,"It doesn't matter how many fine actors are assembled in a film, if the script is terrible, then the movie can't be good."
rotten,"In the aggregate, though, it's a fractious Christmas spent with unpleasant relatives you'd rather avoid."
fresh,"It's movie comfort food - - a few good laughs, a few winks of recognition, a few tears."
rotten,The Family Stone is almost totally emotionally bankrupt.
fresh,"The Family Stone is a satisfying, big-hearted celebration of diversity that will brighten holiday moviegoing - - at least in the blue states."
rotten,Good acting only goes so far to salvage a bad script.
rotten,A machine-tooled entertainment that's as fake and flimsy as a plastic Christmas tree.
rotten,An unpalatable slice of leftover holiday turkey ...
fresh,"The angry scenes are shattering, the funny scenes are sidesplitting and the sadder scenes dutifully earn their tears."
rotten,"The Family Stone should have been a glittering holiday bauble along the lines of the irresistible Love Actually. Instead, Bezucha stuffs into our stockings what he thinks is good for us."
fresh,Moments of high hilarity and cringe-inducing honesty are scattered throughout The Family Stone.
fresh,"Warm up your belly muscles and grab a box of tissues. When it doesn't have you aching with laughter, The Family Stone will have you sobbing like a little girl."
fresh,"It's the kind of warm-hearted, insightful comedy that should become a holiday viewing tradition."
fresh,It plays almost like Terms of Endearment crossed with the feel-good yule romance Love Actually.
fresh,"So check your disbelief at the door, bring along a mini-packet of Kleenex, and brace yourself for Two-Ply and the Family Stone."
rotten,What was supposed to be a jewel turns out to be a simple Christmas trinket.
rotten,"The film ping-pongs between wacky comedy and heavy drama, and it is so heavy on plot and character that it takes on a sitcomlike quality."
rotten,"When The Family Stone did touch me, I had such mixed feelings, I half-wished the movie had kept its hands to itself."
fresh,"Suddenly we're wiping away tears, glancing around to make sure no one noticed we had fallen for this steaming cup of melodrama."
fresh,"It's all fairly obvious and manipulative, though it manages to pander no more than average, and does contain a fair bit of wry humor and wit."
rotten,The movie is a holiday romantic comedy that wants to put the holiday romantic comedy out of business.
fresh,"I don't mind being manipulated as long as it's done well, and writer/director Thomas Bezucha knows how to steer an audience. A great first 'studio' film for Bezucha!"
fresh,"Family is a four-letter word in the literate and smartly acerbic Christmas comedic drama The Family Stone, a relationship smorgasbord of acting talent coming together to produce one of the most perceptive holiday features in years."
fresh,"Like most of these family get-together films, it's not quirky enough to be interesting or amusing enough to be funny. The drama sometimes weighs as much as mom's fruitcake."
rotten,"Rarely have I seen such a maudlin, manipulative, mean-spirited mess masquerading as a holiday comedy."
rotten,The Family Stone could have been worse. This dysfunctional family 'comedy' could have been directed by critic's darling Wes Anderson...
fresh,"After a bit of a rocky start, The Family Stone blossoms into a beautifully crafted morass of dysfunctionality."
fresh,"So, despite its flaws, there is plenty to like, just like any family."
fresh,[A] pleasingly off-kilter domestic comedy.
rotten,
fresh,"While some may roll their eyes at the outrageous fantasyland the Stones live in, others will look at it with wistfulness. Either way, it's a fun place."
fresh,Features a nice ensemble in a story about family prejudice dynamics.
fresh,"Even with an empty tank of ideas by the end of the picture, Stone still remains worthy of a view, providing that desired blast of familial idiosyncrasies just in time for the holiday season."
rotten,"The movie is wonderful as a drama, and wonderful when a comedy, but when the scenes are placed side by side, it's a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie mish mash."
rotten,"... pleasant enough company, but it's a bit like playing charades with the same titles over and over."
fresh,Bezucha's film accurately captures the forlorn hysteria of those few days when love should be the primary emotion and not judgmental claustrophobia.
fresh,"just when it seems we're going to be stuck with nothing more than a well-played, holidays-are-hell comedy, Bezucha spins the story in a different, far more rewarding direction."
rotten,Sort of like Meet the Parents... at Christmastime... without the laughs.
rotten,An absolute freakin' nightmare.
fresh,"This is a family, and a movie, where everyone talks at once -- and more often than you'd think, its characters actually come up with something worth saying."
rotten,The movie's warmth is contagious. Too bad its humor isn't.
fresh,"Hollywood is always making family comedies, but they are rarely about real families: relations who are as difficult as they are wonderful, people who both love and irritate the heck out of each other. Families like The Family Stone."
fresh,A lump of coal brightened by four diamond-sharp performances.
fresh,"Not the kind of family you'd want to spend an hour with, much less a weekend."
rotten,I can't think of an instance in which a film went from under-the-radar to wildly overhyped with the same speed as The Family Stone.
rotten,"Though the laughs are intact, serious subplots... add an unwelcome weight that shifts the whole thing off-kilter."
fresh,"It’s pretty good, it’s entertaining, there are some tense scenes. It’s not the best war film out there, but it’s ok for a non-war-knowledgeable human."
rotten,"Amid the fetishized violence and dubious cultural stereotypes, we're also expected believe that the Californian hillside setting is a mountainous range in the Middle East."
rotten,"Too many cooks, no matter how skilled, can spoil the soup. This is more of a case of one cook trying to cook too many soups. ""A"" for effort though."
rotten,On a technical level ... [this] one-man-against-an-army tale is staged in such an amateurish way that none of ... [the] action ... feels as if it's actually happening.
rotten,"Overlong and over-edited, laboring over the most inconsequential sequences, never letting a single shot of a commando checking his gear suffice when a dozen cuts will drag that out."
fresh,Tomei is absolutely stunning in this.
fresh,"The performances, particularly Dinklage’s and Tomei’s, are muted, like they’re afraid of leaning into the absurdity of the scenario. (Hathaway, surprisingly, does find the silliness in this straitlaced comedy of manners.)"
fresh,There are a lot of comic and dramatic chops being flexed in this film; one reason the central romance is so touchingly persuasive is that it doesn’t have to carry the entire burden of plot or emotion.
rotten,"She Came to Me is a meandering, off-balance dumpster of half-baked ideas. It fails to have much compelling drama and isn't very funny in attempts at absurdist comedy. Everything really falls apart in the last half-hour that is annoying nonsense."
rotten,"Only a cast this appealing could put over such ridiculous fodder, and She Came to Me is nothing if not watchable. But it bends itself into a pretzel trying to be quirky and the strain is all too apparent"
rotten,"Love can heal and push buried creative endeavors to the forefront, but can’t save the world. At least not in the way 'She Came To Me' intends for it to."
rotten,She Came to Me tries too hard to be both drama and light comedy. The result is a miss on both accounts.
rotten,10 minutes into it you will be uncertain where it's headed and with ten minutes left you will be unsure of where its been. A baffling effort with too many characters unsure of where they belong except to escape on a tugboat in the final act.
fresh,"Miller never quite nails the tone necessary to make She Came to Me the ""screwball comedy"" she intended, and it's a lot to ask of viewers to find humor in statutory rape."
fresh,"She Came to Me is a purehearted paean to true love, be it vibrant and youthful or weathered and real."
rotten,"The storytelling is busy enough to hold attention, but it’s the kind of horribly inauthentic jumble of glib ideas played cute that has made a slur of the word “quirky.”"
fresh,A tad less than the sum of all its many delightful parts. But Miller is canny enough to cast it perfectly and generous enough to let her players rescue this marvelous mixed-bag of delights whenever it goes astray.
rotten,It’s bafflingly awful and not at all the movie that’s being advertised.
rotten,"She Came to Me chugs for 102 minutes, but Rebecca Miller’s rom-com strains to pick up steam."
rotten,"And, yet, not even this talented trio can save ""She Came to Me"" from being neither romantic nor comedic, with plenty of unmemorable dialogue, characters, and scenes."
rotten,"This strands the wonderful, whimsical Tomei (begging for her own movie) as a messed-up, romantically fixated singleton whose desire for love may be crazy -- but, the movie asks, isn’t crazy love what will free us all?"
rotten,"It turns out that the film is more red herring than red wine, using its cast of beloved, seasoned actors as little more than pawns to attract an audience to a movie wholly undeserving of their charm and talents."
rotten,"This is dicey material for a screwball comedy, even one with dark undertones, and despite the best efforts of the ensemble, She Came to Me drifts further and further away..."
rotten,There’s a disjointed nature to the whirlwind of strained quirks and forced whimsy — despite some wry laughs along the way — and a talented cast is mostly squandered in the process.
rotten,"A mishmash of flimsy, fanciful and far-fetched notions dressed up as a screwball New York rom-com."
rotten,"With its surfeit of characters and storylines, She Came to Me lays a lot of pipe in the service of very little humor or insight."
fresh,“She Came to Me” is a rewarding comedy-drama that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking.
fresh,"""She Came to Me"" is beautifully performed and directed with great charm, unexpected wisdom, and sweetness."
rotten,"An A-list cast founders in this off-beat romance, involving an opera composer, a tug-boat captain, and a psychiatric manual’s worth of odd behaviours."
fresh,"Asserts that all of us are dealing with a certain amount of psychosis, with the kids representing the youthful hope that grown-ups can overcome their dread just long enough to re-focus on life ... with tug boats, civil war re-enactors and nuns! And Tomei!"
fresh,"She Came to Me isn’t great art, but it’s a pleasing diversion."
rotten,"The story keeps losing its way, with its eventual dramatic turn feeling beyond the scope of what this film can handle."
fresh,"I’ve never been much of a fan of writer/director Rebecca Miller’s films, so her latest is a refreshing surprise, a thoroughly balmy (in a good way) romantic comedy…Dinklage…has never looked so charmingly downcast, anxious and alarmed"
fresh,"I was completely unsure how its two desperate storylines were going to converge. Much to my delight, the way in which they ultimately overlapped resulted in an inspired third-act to a story that manages to be as ultimately moving as it is quirky."
rotten,The whole enterprise feels contrived and full of forced whimsy.
rotten,[T]he whole thing comes across as a fun-house mirror reflection of reality.
fresh,"Amid the roiling neuroses of the adults, the young beloveds provide the film with a surprising emotional ballast."
fresh,This is sublimely clever!  Never did I anticipate where the story was going or where it would eventually land!
fresh,"Often unsteady, but there are ideas that connect here, making for some interesting conflicts."
rotten,"The trailer contains almost everything that’s interesting, clever or alluring about an otherwise jumbled and trite attempt at romantic comedy."
fresh,"Even at its most overworked and effortful, Miller's film exudes a lit-from-within kind of joy, much of it emanating from Tomei's flawed and funny head case."
rotten,"Bruce Springsteen’s “Addicted to Romance”, written to accompany the credits on Rebecca Miller’s film, is lithe and lovely. Too bad the movie itself is anything but."
fresh,"She Came to Me is overstuffed to be sure, but in an admirable way that underlines Miller’s fierce desire to enchant and entertain an audience looking for stories about people, not intellectual property."
rotten,"The ensemble is desperately trying here, but with each passing scene and every line spoken the film somehow becomes dumber, cheesier, more unintentionally hilarious, and more tone-deaf"
rotten,She Came to Me is a preposterous romantic comedy that wastes an appealing cast.
rotten,"A contrived, clunky and tonally uneven mess. In a double feature with Manhattan and Annie Hall, it would be the inferior B-movie."
rotten,"Lack of coherency, generally speaking, is She Came to Me’s most defining flaw... It sits in an exasperating liminal space between comedy and drama where the undercooked elements of each contribute to a whole that’s less than any of its individual parts."
rotten,"Gives tonal whiplash after starting as a quirky rom-com then pivoting to something very serious. Decisions on how to resolve certain relationships are troublesome as is its depiction of mental health struggles. Not fun, interesting, or moving. Just bad."
fresh,She Came to Me is a unique take on the romantic comedy from Rebecca Miller.
rotten,"She Came To Me seems almost experimental, an exercise in seeing how far you can warp and stretch a joke until it no longer resembles one."
rotten,"She Came to Me is a sweet bite in many ways, but you might end up asking yourself: What’s in this?"
fresh,“She Came to Me” doesn’t sound like it would work and no studio would ever greenlight it. But the material is enchanting. Miller is full of surprises and nuances.
fresh,"“She Came to Me” is most unusual for American movies these days as it’s a mid-budget thriller about ordinary lives which centers human feelings and has a human heart. But it does, unfortunately, try a little too hard."
fresh,"It's a bizarre film, whose strangeness is its beauty."
fresh,"The director ping-pongs between characters without succeeding in mustering enough interest in any of them, this lacklustreness separating “She Came to Me” from Miller’s previous fictional effort, the charming 2015 rom-com-drama “Maggie’s Plan.”"
fresh,The payoff is considerably pleasing in ways which bolster the strengths of its characters rather than crippling them at the finish line to satisfy unstated requirements for a happy ending.
rotten,The fatal flaw of the film is that it genuinely believes in the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie.
fresh,"Ultimately, She Came to Me works as an absurdist comedy that also relies on the conventions of drama, it’s a brilliant mix of both and is highly entertaining."
fresh,"By appealing to the more casual moviegoer without losing the best things she brings to the table, Miller has birthed her best film yet."
fresh,"She Came To Me is a grown-up contemporary comedy laced with romance, starring an eye-catching ensemble, led by Peter Dinklage, Anne Hathaway, and Marisa Tomei."
rotten,"... a silly eclair of a thing, stuffed with absurd characters committed in near science-fictional ways to not convincing anybody."
fresh,"It’s funny and strange and sometimes truly dark. Not all of it works or even coheres, but it also offers a fresh look at what love does to people, both on the big screen and out in the world."
rotten,"... a jaw-dropping mishmash of ideas and performances, tonally uncertain with a plot that hangs together like soggy toilet tissue."
rotten,A clunky multistrand romance with such a terminal case of whimsy that almost none of its characters or their relationships ring true.
fresh,"The combination of a first-rate cast, a rippling, frequently witty score and a highly-strung, madcap plot — which itself wouldn’t be out of place in a comic opera — makes for a quirky, offbeat spin on the relationship drama."
fresh,"It’s a likeable confection, and a pleasure to see Marisa Tomei on very good form."
fresh,"Demonstrates how the indie quirkfest can be resonant and real, with characters who have soul instead of a chewy center."
rotten,"She Came to Me has designs on being a grand opera, but it’s definitely more of what the British call a panto."
rotten,"Good intentions only go so far, and “She Came to Me” often looks as frazzled and unfortunate as its nervous characters."
fresh,"Every moment is agitated by the volatility of '90s LA, with a jaw-dropping conclusion."
rotten,What exactly went wrong with Mr. Hancock’s ode to ’90s Hollywood crime thrillers? The Little Things is frustratingly bland.
fresh,"“The Little Things” proudly embraces its gritty neo-noir flavor while leaving the impression that the film could have been plucked right out of the early 1990’s, back when crime thrillers were all the rave."
rotten,"The whole thing still falls victim to uninspired filmmaking choices that range from mundane cinematography and a dull, repetitive score."
rotten,"An interesting final act leads to a frustrating conclusion, which sums up The Small Things habit of doing very little with a lot."
rotten,"With The Little Things, Hancock seems to be trying to subvert the expectations of 1990s audiences, not today's, leaving the movie's conceit to feel underdeveloped."
fresh,Gradually warps into a genuinely gripping and unnervingly ambiguous thriller.
rotten,'The Little Things' features a good setting and two excellent actors in the lead roles. I just wish something would have happened in the movie.
fresh,"While many elements may look and feel familiar to thrillers that have been done to death in the years since the film's inception, fans of the genre may still find plenty to engross them thanks to that throwback style it provides."
rotten,"The Little Things is one of those frustratingly smug films that believes ambiguity to be an aim in and of itself, supposedly audacious for being dark for its own sake."
rotten,"Though the cast is top-notch, the script isn't."
rotten,"Despite the participation of three Oscar winners, it offers little that's fresh or exciting."
rotten,"Yet another dull, meandering and underwhelming crime thriller despite a talented cast and solid production values."
rotten,"There is great potential here for a gripping, memorable modern thriller but everything just feels a bit...average."
fresh,The good thing about the film is that it takes a turn. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,It wouldn't work at all if not for Washington.
rotten,An unnecessary trip to the past. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,...Hancock comes across as too self-conscious in his homages and his big existential swings for The Little Things to feel like anything more than a retread.
rotten,The simplistic and plain tone creates more of a chiller than a thriller.
fresh,This Oscar trifecta had me wrecked with their John Lee Hancock psychological thriller. A little slow in pacing doesn't negate the fact that these performances are totally worth the watch
fresh,"What saves the movie is the star. Malek is stuck at surface level, but with Washington you see the soul-deep breakage of a character whom the abyss has gazed back into."
rotten,"Just an overdose of acting pills, and the rest is just boring."
rotten,"Ultimately, though some elements, including a thoughtful climax, are almost on their way to being interesting, there is simply nothing working to make this worth enduring."
rotten,"... pretends to be more than it is, and that pretense comes aggravated by the fact that its conclusion is stale and the process that leads to it remains hardly entertaining."
rotten,"It's about as fresh as a bloated, bile-tinged corpse dredged from the Los Angeles river, with a markedly similar colour palette to boot."
fresh,"What follows is a solidly crafted, no frills procedural, with writer/director John Lee Hancock getting plenty of mileage out of both Washington and Malik's maverick mentor/young gun dynamic..."
rotten,It's hard to believe three Oscar winning actors could be involved with something so unsatisfying.
rotten,"The main disappointment, other than female characters who only exist to be disposed of, comes from recognising the kernel of something unusual buried in the film's marrow."
rotten,"It would work as popcorn entertainment were it not for the presence of Jared Leto, who delivers one of the worst performances of 2021 so far. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,...Washington adds another effective entry to his roster of tough guys...
fresh,"An atmospheric thriller with few thrills, but fortunately there's a killer cast to save the whole thing from being a complete waste of time."
rotten,"Netflix can knock these kind of crime dramas off the conveyor belt with ease and with far less starpower attached, so how is it that three Oscar winners came to make something this uneventful? That's the real mystery here."
rotten,Denzel Washington's deputy is the only arresting part in the problematic Little Things.
fresh,"Just when you've written it off, a few original ideas emerge in its final stretch."
fresh,A bleak and slow burning serial killer story with its big names making up much of the work the narrative shortfalls necessitate.
rotten,"The strong performances of the cast aren't enough to save this disappointing, slow-paced and problematic thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's not a bad film, but it's not the film we thought it would be."
rotten,"Here, ladies and gentlemen, we have that rarest of all things - a Denzel dud."
rotten,"...a slow, labored affair, with tonal shifts that seem telegraphed far ahead of their arrival or often prove to be much ado about nothing."
fresh,"...quirky performance by Rami Malek as a troubled fellow cop, and a scintillating, award-quality performance by main suspect Jerod Leto, even though it's 30 minutes too long."
rotten,"(Malek is) all wrong for the character, his bouts of rage coming off more like childish hissy fits, but he's so over-the-top at the end that the film loses what little credibility it had left."
fresh,"Hancock manages to create certain moments of tension, again relying more on his actors than on a story spun with finesse... What would we have thought if we'd seen it in the early 90's, before we were CSI experts. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,... doesn't trust the audience to make a firm commitment on any particular conclusion... Leto pitted against Washington and Malek still provides a relatable enough scenario... to cross the finish line.
rotten,It's been a while since I've watched a film work this hard to be so excruciatingly dull.
fresh,"Plays very much like it might have played were it made in the 1990s, except that the characters and narrative turns are far more familiar now."
rotten,"When The Little Things is great, it does more than just hit its blatant marks. When it's terrible, it's grating to the point of being futile."
rotten,"While there are a couple of good ideas here, the whole thing just falls flat."
rotten,"For all of its pedigree and effort, it's actually impressive how dull The Little Things is."
fresh,"The Little Things is an old school procedural thriller, one that allows its grim atmosphere and slowly unfolding story to take centre stage, complete with growled dialogue and bleak twists."
rotten,"The Little Things features all the ingredients that would make a great serial killer feature; top-notch casting, an interesting plot and a talented crew to realize Hancock's vision. But it just does not reach that potential."
fresh,"Effective enough serial killer thriller. Definitely feels very familiar, but it has just enough star power and slickness to get by."
fresh,"Often enough that there are two ways to respond to The Little Things: you can yawn at its star going through the same old routine, or you can appreciate how he's got it down to a fine art."
rotten,"Reasons for not engaging with ""The Little Things"" include the range of acting and the too-tricky storyline."
rotten,It's the little things that make writer/director John Lee Hancock's painfully routine police procedural to catch a serial killer excruciatingly dry and mundane.
rotten,"The Little Things wears its influences too blatantly, gives up its mysteries too easily and then resolves its one final dilemma - what's haunting Deacon exactly? - with an unsatisfying, unconvincing afterthought."
rotten,"You have this very empty movie, ultimately."
fresh,"Ironically, the film could use a few more little things to keep you invested, but it has a few big ones that prove to be just enough."
fresh,"A throwback-minded, stock standard film that mainly survives off its impressive casting."
fresh,The Little Things stands on its own feet...well worth watching and I will not be surprised if Leto receives another Oscar nomination.
rotten,It feels dated. Startlingly so.
fresh,I love the old-school charm of this detective/cop-buddy film.
rotten,"Almost all the shortcomings of the film are balanced out by Denzel Washington's performance. He is simply fun and exciting to watch, even when he's doing some fairly cheesy things, like being haunted by victims or talking to dead bodies in the morgue."
fresh,"Once you look past the performances much of this solidly competent film is fairly by-the-numbers, and how much you enjoy it is going to rely more than usual on whether you think it sticks the ending"
fresh,"The Little Things never adds up to be a good movie. The slow burn never ignites into a quality film fire. Great acting, but hollow storytelling."
fresh,"A haunting, bone-chilling atmospheric thriller that sports terrific performances from its three leads. While the narrative is a little derivative at times, it's engaging and enjoyable and there are some surprises in here."
rotten,"This is a movie that will leave you wondering, ""What was the point of that movie?"" It clearly has a point. It is trying to do something! But what and why?"
fresh,"The Little Things moves in mysterious, murky tics embossed by John Schwartzman's shadowy but sharp cinematography and Thomas Newman's moody score."
rotten,"At the end of the day, The Little Things is fine. It has a twist (but not too much of a twist), it's slick enough to never get too disturbing, and it doesn't require much heavy lifting for viewers."
fresh,"This thriller suffers from somewhat jarring plot turns, some overcooked performances, and other flaws, but the sturdy, classical direction and Washington's anguished performance make it worth seeing."
rotten,"Here is a self-serious serial killer thriller that fees like it was made in the '90s. The fact that the first draft was written in 1993, only reinforces how the resulting film feels old, cliched, and damn-near redundant."
fresh,[It] tells an interesting story with some mature performances and a lesson on how the little things can have a big impact...the equation between the Washington and Maleke evolves organically and the two performers do not disappoint...
rotten,"An exercise in mopeyness, as fresh as brown bananas...."
rotten,It's aggressively fine. Can we put this kind of film to bed already?
rotten,"It has a plot that you've seen a hundred times over. Seriously. I mean, that's being generous. I should say a thousand times over."
rotten,"Jared Leto plays Albert Sparma, a handyman who walks like he has a mechanical bull where his couch should be. He's supposed to be as smart but also talks as though he is constantly slowly gargling marbles. This, according to Leto, is ""acting."""
rotten,When the most interesting choice in your thriller is Jared Leto's paunch you know you're in for a bad time.
fresh,"At the very least it's nice to know that even in the era of mass closures of movie theaters, January filler can still find a home."
fresh,"Writer-director John Lee Hancock may over-egg the masculinity, and the case at hand isn't terribly original, but the film has a rough charm thanks to a far above average cast making the most of the gristly dialog."
rotten,"The Little Things pays homage to everything we love from an old-fashioned detective procedural but aside from being socially tone-deaf, it also has the misfortune of doing it a couple of decades too late."
rotten,"It's clear Hancock went for something moody and edgy, but The Little Things winds up being something much worse -- it's too safe and predictable."
fresh,"While its ending doesn't do its incredible potential justice, The Little Things shines due to its lead performances from Denzel Washington and Rami Malek, including one of Jared Leto's best-ever acting performances."
rotten,"The Little Things wants to be a movie absorbed in its meticulous clues and details. Yet, many of its key pieces and performances feel totally out of sync with each other, creating a suspense thriller that stumbles over itself."
rotten,"The plot ""twist"" lands with an underwhelming and frustrating thud, as you go from ""who did it?"" to ""is that it?""."
fresh,"The Little Things could have been a very good movie. Should have been, really. So many of the pieces were there...Unfortunately, it never quite reaches the heights (or depths, if you will) that you might expect."
rotten,"The competing energies of three Academy Award winners also purloins the possibilities of the narrative's energies, showcasing what sometimes feels like three male divas diving through their favorite tricks and tics."
rotten,"It has some interesting twists and turns, but the biggest problem is for a movie like this is the ending... The ending is completely unsatisfying."
rotten,"Melancholy settings of cheap hotels, serial killer apartments, morgues, and crime labs feed a subliminal background, which, even if the action is passably stimulating, might add to the growing stack of little quarantine things that already depress you."
rotten,Its modest suspense is largely offset by the fact that there's nothing substantial or especially original lurking beneath its eerie exterior.
fresh,"The Little Things fulfills many of the requirements of a gritty genre piece, moving its characters through a world from which no one escapes uncorrupted, sort of a B-movie with an A-list cast and noir shading."
rotten,Compare how strong the film started to how weak it ends - the real mystery is how it got there.
fresh,"Familiar and inessential, but still, they really don't make them like this anymore."
fresh,... that's the thing about casting a trio of Oscar winners - you willingly follow them down the rabbit hole. They play off each other with ease and you relish watching them navigate the intense situations they find themselves in.
rotten,"This neo-noir serial killer procedural flounders despite the presence of three A-list, Oscar-winning actors."
fresh,"The restraint is admirable without being enjoyable. It's easy to imagine exiting the theater in normal times, blinking at the sun, and turning to a friend and simply going, ""Huh, solid enough."""
rotten,"Holding this film back is something more significant, a flaccid script written around a half-decent premise that some of the best actors currently working can sell in moments, but not as a whole."
fresh,"[The Little Things] knows it has a job to do, and it does that job well. It entertains."
fresh,"The Little Things is for fans of brooding police procedurals who love good acting and investigative process, and don't mind that the frills aren't as engaging as we might hope."
fresh,"Within the confines of the genre, it nails basic elements enough to keep crime fans engaged until its reveal-after-reveal-after-reveal ending."
fresh,"Despite some questionable narrative decisions, The Little Things is absorbing and exceptionally thoughtful. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The Little Things is pointless, preposterous, and seemingly endless. It is far from Washington's best work, and unworthy of his talented costars. I couldn't wait for it to be over."
rotten,So much less than the sum of its considerable parts.
rotten,A slow to the starting line cat and mouse game..
rotten,"No amount of slick story beats and scene chewing from Washington, Malek, and Leto can save such a thoughtlessly outdated premise."
rotten,"This driftless, feckless tomfoolery is unfit for mention in the same breath as 1995's ""Copycat,"" let alone the other 1995 serial killer movie it's desperately mimicking. But in the spirit of dropping a hint: This is, at best, more like 1.75."
fresh,"The ending may leave some audiences lukewarm, but it's different enough to elevate The Little Things above mediocrity."
fresh,Hancock must be grateful for the work of Washington and Malek. They elevate this movie from a standard detective yarn to a slightly better-than-average neo-noir.
fresh,One of the things that works best about the film is that it's arranged to be a mystery for the audience right alongside the detectives.
rotten,THE LITTLE THINGS lacks the edge-of-your-seat component that we have come to expect in a Denzel Washington crime thriller.
rotten,"The terrific cast intermittently electrifies, but it can't bring to life a cold and stiff script. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Despite its star power, The Little Things fails to build any real momentum or chills that the genre is known for. The story falls flat on its face in one of the worst 3rd acts in recent memory."
fresh,"The heavyweight performances, some of the finest in a serial-killer thriller since Anthony Hopkins played that guy who enjoyed liver and fava beans with a nice Chianti, carry it through to the thought-provoking conclusion."
fresh,"Washington, Malek, and Leto should keep you invested in trying to figure out the whodunnit while watching the mind games their three characters play on each other."
rotten,"Too much Denzel-ing & Leto-ing, for starters. Not much there in there, and I think that has to with the tiresome police story that had been seen before, & cops aren't saints."
fresh,"Is there anything more mesmerising than the sight of Denzel Washington, slouching on the movie screen?"
rotten,The Little Things succumbs to a cookie-cutter thriller storyline and antiquated genre contrivances.
rotten,"There's so much about the story that's unimaginative and sluggishly paced that there's very little suspense throughout the story ... The Little Things is very careless with details, and a more appropriate title for the movie is The Big Plot Holes."
rotten,"On a scale of one to ""Se7en,"" ""The Little Things"" barely rates a three."
rotten,"Washington and the nuances of his character are thereby undermined by the script that reaches for shock at the expense of logic. Basically, the film may secure some of the little things, but it misses too many of the big ones."
rotten,"The film lacks an urgency; it's as if, at times, it was screening in slow motion."
fresh,This taut and suspenseful crime thriller rises above its procedural trappings thanks to richly textured characters and carefully modulated performances.
fresh,Home Alone 2: Lost in New York manages to up the stakes while Kevin has to fend for himself in a very different environment.
rotten,Sorely lacks the situational specificity and just the vague whiff of 'this could actually happen' from the previous film.
fresh,"...the movie admittedly boasts (and benefits from) an ongoing emphasis on appealing, engaging elements..."
fresh,"Culkin is breezily winning once again as the self-reliant kid alone, while Pesci and Stern deserve combat metals (especially Stern) to the bricks and slings they endure."
rotten,"It's much more violent than the first film's comparable set of dirty tricks. And Kevin, removed from his embattled home, seems much more cavalier, possibly even meaner than his bullying older brother, Buzz (Devin Ratray)."
rotten,"The pleasures here are entirely cruel, with an unhealthy concentration on the suffering of the victims, on the thudding impact of various objects against their heads, on their howls of agony."
fresh,"It is going to make a ton of money, but you never feel that's the only reason it was made. It respects itself and it respects us, and there's no reason to begrudge its success."
rotten,"The result, with some exceptions, plays like an over-elaborate parody of the first film, reminding us why we enjoyed it without being able to duplicate its appeal."
rotten,"This sequel has lots of color and Christmas warmth to recommend it. Its portrait of urban American is ridiculously romanticized, though, and the climatic fight with two silly-sinister bad guys is as nasty as it is cartoonish."
rotten,"Though equal to its original in quantity of sadistic slapstick, this anticipated sequel is dull and strikingly uninspired."
fresh,"Home Alone 2: Alone in New York is a rollicking return to the pesky juvenile high jinks, broad slapstick antics and tender sentimentality that made the first film a phenomenon -- and it does it all even better."
rotten,"Despite this material's definite loss of innocence and surprise, it offers some engaging moments."
rotten,"Culkin, an angel-faced Terminator more potent than any assault rifle-armed Schwarzenegger, swells with empowerment and lashes out, symbolically, at the indifferent parents, the ignorant teachers, the irritable authority figures, the brutal older sibling."
fresh,"As slapstick escapism goes, this is well-engineered stuff, though it could have been so much better (and more believable) with a bit more heart."
fresh,A well-crafted film with brilliant scenes aimed at an audience that knows exactly what it's going to see. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Taking no chances, the makers of the sequel have manufactured a remarkably close facsimile of the original movie -- even duplicating some of the jokes. But Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is an improved, more luxurious model."
fresh,"This is, inevitably perhaps, not as funny as the original -- the law of diminishing returns applying here as with most sequels -- although even the most demanding of viewers should find something to their liking."
rotten,"The filmmakers stick like glue to the formula of the original: a little boy from a well-to-do family left on his own is threatened by low-life working-class crooks whom he repeatedly foils and tortures, and upscale property values prevail."
rotten,"With any luck at all, the McCallisters will just stay home next Christmas."
fresh,"The picture, after all, is about Macaulay Culkin, who plays the wise, sober, inquiring, luxury-loving Kevin with the same unmannered appeal he brought to the original, and his fiendish foes, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern."
fresh,"This time, everybody's favorite resourceful mite is adrift in Manhattan with the same two duncey thugs on his case with the resultant cartoon mayhem of even richer and more highly evolved subteen sadism."
fresh,Home Alone 2 takes up a story done before with a great cast - and Macaulay Culkin at its core - and refreshes it for another holiday classic.
rotten,"Whatever merits we attach to the first film in this series, they are all but abandoned somewhere in the mess of a follow-up."
rotten,"Just when it appears this can't get any worse, along comes white supremacist Donald Trump in a pointless cameo."
fresh,"As a sequel, the movie manages to be funny, if predictable, and occasionally borders on heart-warming."
fresh,"Does it really matter that Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is, in essence, the same movie as its megasmash predecessor?"
fresh,"Let's face it: Culkin's self-reliant suburban warrior has entered a whole generation's pop mythology. He's their Knight in Shining Parka, safely beyond criticism."

fresh,"We begin a 129 min journey jam-packed with quippy retorts, gratuitous violence and a hail of bullets that leap you chuckling and wiping tears of laughter from your eyes.  That being said, The Gray Man is entirely devoid of substance."
rotten,"Unfortunately this did not flow for me. Gosling on paper seemed to be a very interesting character, but instead his character don't have real progression or likability. Then the action just wasn't up to par with what we've seen this amazing directors do"
rotten,"Despite its fast-paced rhythm and the caliber of the talent in front and behind the camera, it ends up being an unimaginative and formulaic spy flick. [Full Review in Spanish]"

fresh,"Rather than take some narrative big swings, the story is content with keeping it conventional. But for those hungry for fast-paced grand-scaled action, the Russos have you covered."
rotten,"The Gray Man is a very bad, almost instantly forgettable film. What makes things worse in this case is that the filmmakers, the Russo brothers, do possess a degree of perception, talent and imagination."

rotten,The Gray Man promises - and tries - to give us the whole world but falls short by many a mile.
rotten,"Beware, fans, your ears may implode. This thriller is a heavy load."
rotten,"The Gray Man could have been so much more, but that would have required so much less."
fresh,"The fact that this is on Netflix denies the viewer of seeing this spectacle on the big screen which is a shame. However, it proves to be an advantage as being able to pause the film periodically is a plus.  You’ll need to catch your breath now and again."
rotten,"Nothing beats the adrenaline rush of a suspenseful action thriller but watching The Gray Man makes me recall other movies that gave me that feeling, as there’s none of that to be found here."
rotten,"The Gray Man is not the worst film Netflix has put out by any means, but it is yet another example of the kind of bland and insipid anti-cinema that has become their trademark."
fresh,"This is the kind of movie critics may be inclined to dismiss, but it tickles the tastebuds of viewers who like some bangs for their buck, an adrenalin blast and a few jokes."
rotten,"The film's misplaced, weak dialogue, combined with too many jump cuts for action sequences, make The Gray Man feel like a generic cross between the Marvel universe and John Wick. That is not to say the film is horrible, but it is not good."
fresh,"The Gray Man is a popcorn movie for the weekend, when in reality it doesn’t take any risks.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Mindless but well-acted and well-shot action pic.
fresh,"[A] likeable, muscular, high-octane thriller that you’ll remember for its chaos and carnage rather more than its generic serves-its-purpose storyline."
rotten,All that effort and all that money should have paid for a better screenplay.
fresh,"Thrills on the level of an around-the-world DIEHARD, dirs Anthony & Joe Russo out-Bond multiple times better than the current Bond. Chris Evans plays the villain to the hilt, proving that a trash 'stache and white pants can work on certain types. Great!"
fresh,I'll give it a B- for its simple run and gun mindset and all the butt-kicking Ryan Gosling does.
fresh,"I feel comfortable assuring you that whenever there’s shooting, running, detonating, or general mayhem onscreen, you’ll like what you’re seeing."
rotten,"A cliché on top of a cliché... A movie made out of recycled cardboard, made by Netflix's algorithm to entertain for two hours and be forgotten five minutes later. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"He [Gosling] makes for a good sparring partner next to Chris Evans’ character. You can tell Evans is having an absolute blast as this reckless hotshot who dons some slicked back hair, a sharp mustache, and is the anti-Captain America."
rotten,The Gray Man is a lot of flash with nothing to hold onto. Feeling that way about movies is not what I wanted. It left me feeling gloomy and gray.
rotten,The Gray Man is the best example of the miserable state of contemporary action cinema.   [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Killers with a conscience, flash drives and bosses are the real bad guys. Routine action is then not the counterbalance to the question why we are still wasting money making movies like this in 2022."
rotten,"The Gray Man is alright for an action movie on Netflix, but isn’t quite in the big leagues."
rotten,"Empty, obnoxious, upsetting."
rotten,Somehow two directors who have defined blockbuster genre filmmaking recently can’t get a firm grip on this caper.
rotten,"…it’s hard going, instantly forgettable and impossible to start a franchise with…"
rotten,"[A] bloated, brain-dead action movie...nothing more than a catena of big, noisy set-pieces held together by the flimsiest of plots, with an occasional bit of juvenile banter added to the otherwise pedestrian dialogue."
rotten,"Spectacular in a garishly stylized way somewhere on the spectrum between John Woo and Michael Bay.  Big, loud, dumb escapist spy thriller stuff with nothing to say but a lot to shoot at, chase and blow up."
rotten,"As part of the weak story, there’s a flash drive involved, which contains a treasure trove of top secret information that shouldn’t get in the wrong hands. Yes, that old canard. Too much is done for laughs. Mark Greaney doesn’t write comic novels."
rotten,"The whole movie is more and more and more: more explosions, more fireworks, more shooting, more bullets. The Russo’s didn’t care how preposterous this became. I think they got lost in their own mythology."
fresh,"It's impossible not to be highly entertained by the super star cast clearly having the time of their lives, the explosive action scenes and the savvy directing skills of the Russo Brothers."
fresh,"Chris Evans, Ryan Gosling and Dhanush fight for your attention. The plot is clichéd, but the Russo brothers deliver a film packed with action, charismatic actors and beautiful locations."
fresh,Another highly enjoyable spectacle from The Russo Brothers with some stellar action sequences and fun performances from Evans and Gosling.
rotten,"Love The Russos and I'm always down for a good spy adventure.  Yet, The Gray Man left me wanting just a tad bit more.  Having said that this all star cast led by Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling are everything and who doesn't love Aflre Woodard as a badass!"
rotten,"A colorful, action-packed spy flick to please the Marvel loyalists but likely forgettable to many others. ... It’s enough globetrotting to fill James Bond’s passport, cover Indiana Jones’ flight map and make even Jason Bourne dizzy."
fresh,"It is a big, noisy, explosive adrenaline rush — a live-action spin on that old ""MAD"" magazine comic, ""Spy vs. Spy"" — and about as deep."
rotten,"I think they're looking for a series that could replace [James Bond], but in order for that to happen, people need to want to see to this one and the ones to come after, and I already know I don't want to see the next one."
rotten,It's kind of like watching a movie that's a trailer for itself.
fresh,"There’s some decent action set pieces and a formidable cast, but not enough to pop out of summertime filler."
rotten,"As with all Netflix productions with blockbuster dreams, this one is tailor made to be watched at home. You only need to lift your eyes from the second screen whenever you hear an explosion.  [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The Gray Man doesn’t have much in the way of gray matter, and almost proudly has nothing to say about anything important."
fresh,"Directors Anthony and Joe Russo deliver an unrelenting fusillade of star-studded, big-budget action mayhem. Their adaptation of Mark Greaney's The Gray Man espionage thriller turns on a two-hour bullets and beatdowns spigot."
rotten,"If you love the MCU and loads of cartoonish CGI violence, then you’ll love “The Gray Man."" If you’ve read the books, avoid the movie at all costs. If you haven't read the books—read them. It's a whole summer's worth of thoroughly engrossing page-turning."
fresh,"For all the overkill, The Gray Man is big, loud fun. Mr. Gosling is hip to what's going on; Mr. Evans gets to gobble up the scenery. And even if the elements are hackneyed, they're not clumsy."
rotten,"The film exists to set up sequels, to spend money on fancy location shoots, and to look glamorous and exciting; every harder edge has been sanded down to nothing."
fresh,The Gray Man wallows in its obvious excesses because it doesn’t take itself remotely serious and neither does that stellar cast... which allows for almost every absurdity that unfurls on screen to possess a wink-wink-nudge-nudge kind of appeal.
rotten,"It as aggressively, soullessly stupid a chunk of high-density concrete as you’ll ever dial into."
fresh,"“The Gray Man” will easily fit the bill for action fans. It’s a big, loud, dumb spy-thriller that could become a franchise."
rotten,"I've watched far worse, but damn, The Gray Man is just a bland, ugly shell of an action movie."
fresh,"Boundless, entertaining fun... And absolutely forgettable. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"I suppose it's a world brimming with possibility, but The Gray Man doesn't offer us a compelling enough first chapter to have me groveling for more of the same."
fresh,"It's an action [film], one with fights, explosions, shootouts and a few gags. It isn't original, but it's fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The Gray Man benefits from its talented ensemble cast, the Russos’ creative flair, and strong action work–it is just unfortunate that its frenetic pacing doesn’t complement the monotone premise, so it fails to revolutionize the spy thriller genre."
rotten,"It’s so hackneyed it’s like the Russos are trying to parody hackneyed, blowing their own punchlines as they do."
rotten,"Netflix broke the bank on this formula action epic fronted by Ryan Gosling and Chris Evans as assassins for hire. It’s good enough to rank as watchable. But even in these inflationary times, shouldn't 200 million bucks buy us more than good enough?"
rotten,"A decent, disposable action movie."
fresh,"Whilst it may not be particularly innovative, The Gray Man offers enough exciting action, two game leads, and plenty of spectacle over substance. As long as you don’t expect too much, you’ll have fun with this."
fresh,"[The] good news is, [Ryan Gosling] pulls off a convincing action-oriented role in The Gray Man."
rotten,"It feels like a mixtape, pulling bits from a bunch of much better, much more daring action movies, to create a medley that is mediocre at best."
fresh,"Filled with laughs and so much blood, this film crosses many lines. Just plain bloody fun, gets a B grade from me."
fresh,"By translating the working relationship (or master-slave, since the latter doesn't get any pay) into the vocabulary of common relationship counselling parlance, the film actually elevates its symbolic status."
fresh,"[D]espite divided reviews and less than exciting box office predictions, Renfield will likely do what every [Nicolas] Cage movie manages (or maybe, is cursed) to do: fail at the theatres, before being resurrected as a cult favourite."
fresh,"Wickedly funny, filled with charismatic electricity, and surprisingly touching, it rings new beats for the most classic of all vampire tales. RENFIELD is a classy yet bloody riff on the legendary story of Dracula."
rotten,"""I never drink (pause) wine"" and other classic scenes and lines are recreated well at least three times, and that's why it gets the three stars out of 10 in the review."
rotten,"Renfield has some terrific ideas, hilarious moments and a couple of indelible scenes. But it gets a bit ruined by having a bad guy who no one really wants to see lose."
fresh,"And yet: Renfield and Quincy's final plan is, to put it mildly, dumb as hell, and the ending goes against pretty much everything we know about Dracula."
rotten,"At the end of a very long 93 minutes, you are left with a movie that could have been a laugh riot, but is a rather disappointing bleh bleh bleh"
fresh,"What “Renfield” delivers is sick, twisted fun. If you happen to be a fan of Lloyd Kaufman and Troma horror, or Charles Band and Full Moon Productions, “Renfield” is going to be right up your alley."
rotten,For about 10 minutes the film gets it. The rest is standard action fare where the lamest of crime families gets precedence over Cage finally getting to play a legitimate bloodsucker that is far less funny or scary than his turn in Vampire's Kiss
rotten,Any episode of What We Do in the Shadows trumps whatever’s being attempted with either horror or comedy in the flaccid offerings of Renfield.
fresh,"An unbelievably ridiculous, purposefully silly story about the toxic relationship between Dracula and Renfield, expectedly elevated by the ""OTT King"" Nicolas Cage and an up-to-the-challenge Nicholas Hoult."
fresh,"“Renfield” is a bloody good time at the movies. Nicholas Hoult and Nicholas Cage are fantastic when they share scenes together, complimented by stunning visual effects and a hilarious script."
fresh,"Cage is a delight as the prince of darkness, hamming it up with a performance that makes it look like the actor is having a blast on screen."
fresh,"Outrageously funny, incredibly well-acted and featuring more gory action sequences than you can shake a dismembered arm at, Renfield is a blast from start to finish."
rotten,"Always serviceable, rarely remarkable, Renfield is nothing but an amalgamation of occasional laughs...tightly bound in a coffin of tired takes."
fresh,"Renfield is AWESOME. A GIGANTIC SURPRISE that had me laughing, reacting, screaming, & dying for the next scene. Cage is SO Dracula & Hoult is AMAZING as RENFIELD. It answers the question… what if Mortal Kombat had Dracula?"
fresh,"Renfield is at full power when Cage is front and centre, and feels like its blood is slowly being drained when he's out of the frame."
rotten,Renfield feels relatively lackluster due to doing very little with its promising hilarious premise with Hammer Horror sensibilities.
fresh,"A great comedic performance by Nicholas Hoult combines with over-the-top, bloody action to create an extremely enjoyable time at the movies."
rotten,"Hear me out: Nicolas Cage deserves an Oscar nomination for his performance as Dracula in Renfield... Unfortunately, this movie is also beneath him."
fresh,"The gore is wild and the fight choreography uses every bit of it. The movie ultimately delivers everything it promises as a result, a fact that makes it successful if not inherently ""good."""
fresh,"The most memorable part of a story that is consisently silly but never wildly funny, is Cage’s portrayal of Dracula."
rotten,"There’s a spicier, punchier and sillier movie trapped inside. Shame it couldn’t be coaxed out."
fresh,The end result is a sometimes uneven horror/camp/comedy that only these two actors [Cage/Hoult] have the skills to navigate.
fresh,"It’s a clever hook, and one that allows, uh, fresh blood to be pumped into the Dracula saga."
fresh,"Renfield is pretty much exactly what it presents itself as in the marketing, for good and for ill, and while it is amusing, it doesn't take the time to really dig into the interesting concepts and topics it presents."
fresh,Renfield is played for laughs – though with no shortage of blood and violence.
fresh,"The problem with Renfield is that it is too serious to be campy, yet too campy to be a drama."
fresh,"Every conflict in this film is a masterful choreography of blood, bone, and tearing skin, with Nic Cage vamping it up (I KNOW I KNOW BUT I HAD TO SAY IT) by channeling the signature moves of both Bela Lugosi and Frank Langella."
rotten,"There are a few decent ideas in ""Renfield,"" but they’re left to die of starvation while the plot gives us scene after scene in which gangsters have shootouts..."
fresh,"Not what I’d consider one of the best horror movies of the year, but it’s a perfectly good horror comedy, and sometimes that’s enough..."
rotten,"The story itself ends up leaving something to be desired, feeling like an intriguing concept in search of a better narrative, ultimately turning a semi-fun flick into something mostly forgettable."
rotten,"Renfield is funny enough and slick enough to entertain for ninety minutes, but like Renfield entering Dracula’s service, it abandons all hope of achieving anything more than mere mediocrity in favor of taking the easy way out."
fresh,"It is a ton of fun, in its own right and in the layers McKay imbeds in loving homage to the classics of cinema and horror literature."
fresh,"As a super-deranged Count Dracula, the concept of too much is meat, drink and dessert to a Gothically embellished Nicolas Cage."
fresh,Delights aplenty await fans of high-end horror-comedy in this slickly paced splatterfest...Florid spurts of digital blood gush forth from dismembered limbs in the many fight scenes that combine gunfire with magnificently gratuitous gore.
rotten,Is this... a bit? A movie has to be better than a bit.
fresh,"The main attraction is Nicolas Cage’s barnstorming performance as Dracula, played mainly for laughs yet indicating careful study of his many predecessors in the role."
fresh,… often fun but profoundly uneven …
fresh,A gory comedy that doesn’t overstay its welcome.
rotten,"Please, for the love of God, it's a 90-minute movie--75 minutes of which are spent wondering when it's going to get back to the point."
rotten,Ultimately undone by its self-satisfied snark and the bombastic CGI overkill decreed by the modern movie marketplace.
rotten,"The characters are insipid and rudimentary, crudely carved from the granite of countless hoary cliches."
fresh,"Renfield strives to be innovative, and that's appreciated, though its reluctance to indulge in the macabre and absurd is noteworthy. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Renfield leaves the coffin door open for a sequel, which might be pushing the concept too far. However, there’s plenty of bite in this comedy to make it a low brow crowd pleaser."
fresh,Nicholas Hoult brings a lot of energy and fun... he's always ready to spill into campy every once in a while too. It's a great pairing... You know Nicolas Cage is living in that world.
rotten,... Disposable entertainment that's only sellable by the presence of a star and the false promise of a novel approach to the material. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,... A whirlwind of situations that do not take the time to justify themselves so as to not flood the path of what is already a dull-bladed blender of everything that contemporary vampire stories suggest. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Ultra-violent, frightful thriller/horror/comedy - with wild-eyed Nicolas Cage delivering an over-the-top, campy performance."
fresh,"A rollicking party you attend to see Nicolas Cage unleashed, for its explicit violence and over-the-top humor, and in which you stay for some endearing characters whom you unexpectedly end up adoring."
fresh,"Cage seems to be having the time of his life hamming it up and gleefully creating a bloodbath everywhere he goes. While the comedy aspect isn't quite as sharp as the horror side, it's still a decent mix that many other films get wrong."
fresh,"Once again, Cage shows us that he perfectly understands what charisma means in cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The villains, the Lobo gang, are deliciously, cartoonishly evil, and the depth of their motivations starts and stops at superficial interpretations of “control.”"
fresh,"Go to the movie and have some fun. It's a gorefest, folks -- heads really roll."
fresh,"I think it's minor work, but it's perfectly entertaining."
rotten,"Not as funny as it could’ve been, the action scenes are horrendous, and not nearly as visually compelling as what’s implied by a New Orleans-set vampire movie starring Nicolas Cage."
rotten,So much potential here but the comedic/dramatic delivery was much less than expected.
fresh,"It's a fun enough time. Nothing more, nothing less."
fresh,"The film is entertaining and will rejoice lovers of gore. What Renfield lacks, though, is mystery. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Cage really sinks his teeth into this role and the chemistry between he and Hoult sells the premise. The action is beautifully bonkers and OTT, but, with all of the assembled comedic talent, it's a shame Renfield isn't...funnier."
fresh,"Reinfield is a bloody good time! [...] It’s very gory, stylized, over the top, and campy [...] Nicholas Hoult is a great lead in this, I liked Awkwafina playing a role we haven’t really seen her in, and Nicolas Cage was perfectly cast."
rotten,"Cage, who can chew scenery like no human on earth, finally gets to deliver the biting (pun intended) performance he’s dreamed of since “Vampire’s Kiss” in 1988. It’s a pity, really, that Cage’s chance came in a movie that’s so … bloodless."
rotten,"Renfield is so close to working and occasionally it does. Overall though, the script focuses on the wrong aspects that end up dragging the whole thing down."
fresh,Renfield manages to find fun parts of its vampire premise and sink its fangs deep enough to appreciate a Nic Cage Dracula picture.
fresh,"Renfield is a fun, zany, and ultra-gory good time! Nicolas Cage as a Legosi-era Dracula is something I never knew I needed in my life."
rotten,"In Renfield, Nicholas Hoult is a delight as Dracula’s much-abused personal assistant. But even Nicolas Cage as the Count himself can’t keep the movie on track."
fresh,"As the newly self-actualized Renfield would say, it is enough, and it has enough, at least for horror comedy fans looking for some light laughs and even lighter scares."
rotten,"Renfield gets too broad for its britches, and that’s unfortunate, but that being said, Cage is still really great here."
fresh,There's a lot to sink your teeth into.
rotten,"...an irresistible, fun premise that’s squandered to exceedingly (and distressingly) palpable effect by McKay..."
rotten,"None of these fragments cohere into the bloody rewarding romp that may have been intended. Oh well, it’s possible to enjoy Renfield in small bites, but Bela Lugosi can rest easy."
rotten,"It’s loud, cluttered, diverting, sporadically funny, and depthless—a hectic mishmosh, but still better than most such enterprises. In other words, not exactly good, but reasonably cheering in its not-bad-ness."
fresh,"All in all, Renfield doesn’t quite suck, but it’s not the campy vampire comedy we — or Nicolas Cage — deserve."
rotten,"McKay's goal with this movie is to give the source material a new look, but he doesn't have the tools to carry out a proper makeover. This is a re(vamp)ing that could have used a little more coherence."
fresh,"Despite all the blood and silliness, there's actually a warm-hearted encouraging message here. Probably won't win any oscars, but I had a great time watching it!"
rotten,"[Renfield] actually could have been a great, campy horror comedy, but in the end it's just a bland movie elevated by some great scenes and a great performance."
rotten,We’re constantly interrupted by some clumsy crime yarn about a cop and a gangster and their complicated family lives. That’s not what we came for... we don’t deserve Nicolas Cage -- and he deserves better than whatever this is.
rotten,"Renfield suffers from a disease somewhat endemic to modern comedy, which is that, in its desperation to try and outrace the limits of its high-concept premise, it overcomplicates everything."
fresh,If you're a fan of the genre -- if you if you like vampires and you like comedy -- it's the perfect film to go check out. It's a good time.
fresh,"Renfield had loads in the way of comedy clout. But the script is never as funny as the assembled talent would suggest and good action sequences only go so far. It's watchable in a straight-to-DVD way, nothing more."
rotten,The latest take on Dracula (if you want to call it that) is an absurdly silly mashup of superhero and horror genres that nearly rises from the-lack-of-studio-faith coffin based on the likability of its cast and their game efforts.
fresh,"A perfectly fine comedy horror (in that order) film that finds Hoult channelling his Warm Bodies character. Cage is having a campy blast, though Awkwafina is kinda wasted on a tired mob story that feels undercooked."
rotten,"Renfield does not trust the audience to add two plus two, or count. It does not only pre-cut your food for you, but pre-chews it also. Sure, the story could not be easier to digest, but it has also lost all appeal in the process."
fresh,"Nicholas Hoult as Dracula’s loyal servant resembles a cross between a Marvel superhero and John Wick. There’s action, comedy, and massive amounts of gore, but let’s face it, you’re here to see Nicolas Cage as the archetypal vampire and he’s fangtastic!"
fresh,It's a comedy with bite.
fresh,"Renfield is like the junk food version of a horror comedy. It has all the right ingredients for something that should be fantastic, but its recipe for action, comedy, and satisfying storytelling is imbalanced to the point of near disgust."
fresh,Director Chris McKay establishes a wildly gothic visual sensibility that works in tandem with yet another riotously entertaining performance from Nicolas Cage. So the movie will definitely find its fans.
rotten,Even the unflappable Nic Cage can’t ham it up enough to save the movie from its many self-inflicted wounds.
rotten,"The audience must actively choose to buy into [the film's farce], but Renfield is offering no money back when its plot lands in the unholy genre of predictable, forgettable supernatural smut ... Even Cage can't keep ""Renfield"" from sucking so bloody bad."
rotten,"This surfeit of loud, obnoxious, violent junk audaciously claims to call itself a vampire farce, but there isn’t a genuine shred of originality anywhere in sight and it’s as witty as an ambulance with a flat tire."
fresh,"To put it simply, Renfield is plain ol’ horror fun for all types of genre fans."
rotten,"Cage will forever stand as one of the greatest Draculas to ever put on the cape. As for the film itself, it will forever stand as a movie that most certainly does not deserve him."
rotten,"Chris McKay’s Renfield takes an interesting premise and squanders it, abandoning the most interesting relationship at the heart of it for lots of therapy rhetoric and a romance plot line that never seems to work."
rotten,"While on the surface, nothing in Renfield is worthy of abject hatred, its clumsy bloatedness inspires a certain disillusionment in Hollywood comedies: twice this year we’ve been promised giddy fun and been let down by pure unimaginative laziness."
rotten,Rarely do the jokes ever come close to matching the exaggerated silliness of the film’s violence.
rotten,"The things that work about Renfield are outweighed by those that don’t, and it’s a shame because it’s not hard to imagine a version of the film that could have been much better with a bit of massaging and a better grip on what makes these characters tick."
fresh,"A work marked by happiness, vertigo and frivolity. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Cage was born to play a vampire. Renfield, then, feels like the long-withheld fulfilment of a promise -- the actor finally gets to play the biggest vampire of them all, Dracula. His performance is faultless... If only Renfield had featured him more."
fresh,Renfield is a goofy and sharp comedy that bites deep.
rotten,"The sparse Saturday night crowd I saw it with happily tuned into its broad cartoon style. The glib insubstantiality, though, left me hungry afterwards."
rotten,The real horror of it all is the way director Chris McKay blows what should have been a slam-dunk premise.
fresh,"This movie has plenty of entertainment in it, but the actors are so good we want them to come back in a real vampire spoof that bites better."
fresh,"Renfield is here for those who like laughs accompanied by red geysers, expansive monsters, and protagonists who are up to defying expectations. It’s mostly a blast."
rotten,"It has an amusing premise, a killer supporting performance and bafflingly little interest in either. A staggering misallocation of resources."
rotten,"Suffering from genre dysphoria, Renfield has all elements in place for a hilarious comedy but ultimately takes itself just a little too seriously for its concept."
rotten,"Renfield features running gags about ska music and some guy named Kyle, and even its needle drops feel like missed opportunities."
fresh,"’m recommending Renfield for Cage and Hoult alone, but it’s missing out on fully capitalizing on the concept."
fresh,This tension between competing tonalities makes Renfield consistently entertaining but undeniably uneven... But Cage and company are so clearly having the time of their (undead) lives with the material that it feels petty to quibble too much.
rotten,Renfield never builds upon the promise of its premise.
fresh,"Nicolas Cage is fang-tastic, and so is Nicholas Hoult as the co-dependent Renfield. It's the kind of ridiculous movie that's meant to entertain."
fresh,The scenes between Nicolas Cage and Nicholas Hoult are brilliant. It's too bad that the other characters and subplots are really bland and generic.
fresh,"A modern reimagining of Bram Stoker’s Dracula that looks at the signs and dangers of codependency, served on a delicious platter of wacky comedy, zesty action, and hammy Nicolas Cage performance."
rotten,"If you've watched the film's enticing trailer, you've already heard almost all the best lines and seen a tauter, more engaging version of Renfield than the sloppy mess it turns out to be."
rotten,"It turns out there are several ways to kill Dracula. Not only with crosses and sunlight, but also by forcing him to guest star in an episode of Starsky & Hutch."
rotten,"Garlic bulbs at the ready for Chris McKay’s horror-comedy: a cynical side-hustle of a picture, come to drain the extremities of the Bram Stoker estate and install a lowly pretender as king."
rotten,An ultra-violent and unimaginative Dracula splatter pic that sucks.
fresh,"I would never be so bold as to imply that Renfield was a great comedy, action piece, or horror film, but it does all three to varying degrees quite well, and that rich combination makes for a fun crowd-pleaser."
rotten,"This action/horror/comedy starts well, with a good idea and some big laughs, but it soon devolves into an overly familiar mishmash of fights and chases. It's both trying too hard and not hard enough."
fresh,Perfectly good fun. But one can’t shake the sense that this 93-minute film has lost a deal of its secondary plotting along the way to release.
rotten,The entire movie is an intellectual nightmare... This franchise peaked long ago.
fresh,Fast X maintains the key ingredients and takes them to the max. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Tiresome in all the ways it should kick ass.
fresh,"Roman and Tej have their banter, and Cena's Jakob brings some much needed self-deprecation, but Momoa's Dante is a delightfully catty bitch, and really saves Fast X from getting bogged down in the franchise's combo of gonzo idiocy and weepy telenovela."
rotten,"Fast X devours every iteration of the franchise and spits the biggest, fastest, and most ridiculous parts back at you, sometimes without chewing."
rotten,Vin Diesel’s Dom is particularly monosyllabic and earnest (Vin does takes these films very seriously) but mostly the rest of the crew turn up in scenes that are so disparate that it’s hard to connect with them.
fresh,"All that we liked about the franchise is there including monster motors, vaguely juvenile jousting (we did find it funny when we were younger and more confused) and a spot of street racing"
rotten,"Just as surely as the Earth circles the sun, there are some certainties to be found in the Fast & Furious franchise as it hits #10 in the series."
rotten,A certain degree of improbability is acceptable in a massive action film but eventually the laws of physics do trump everything else.
rotten,It shows clear signs of wear and tear in every boring chase that sends Vin Diesel down avenues to defy the laws of physics in his 1970 Dodge Charger R/T. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"... pushes the envelope on everything, reason be damned, resulting in the high-octane excitement you expect, though it makes the least amount of sense out of the entire series."
fresh,"As a direct counterpart to Vin Diesel, who still seems like the only one in the cast still taking any of this remotely seriously, Momoa has quickly shot to the top of the list of series bad guys by being just as over-the-top as he can be."
fresh,"There's no telling how many more of these movies Diesel and Company have up their sleeves, but at least this one tries its best to set the stage for a new trilogy with a befitting villain in Jason Momoa."
fresh,"Look, if you're gonna see and Fast & the Furious you know what you're gonna get. You know there's gonna be car chases, you know it's gonna be over-the-top, but I still enjoyed this movie."
rotten,"Fast X desperately wants to be a fun popcorn summer flick. The film manages to achieve that status quite a few times, but the runtime is so sprawling, the script so nonsensical, and the action sequences so drawn-out that it cannot sustain the levity."
fresh,Not the best Fast & Furious film but the fact that the film goes back to the basics and forgets about things like going into space makes it a worthy addition to the franchise.
rotten,"Living on-screen life a quarter mile at a time now seems more like a variety show than a movie, at least where all that recognisable talent is involved."
rotten,"Fast X’s focus is action, loads of it. Many of which you've seen from Mission: Impossible, DC, James Bond, and even past Fast films. It's like listening to a band’s greatest hits album, but only to realize that they are running out of original ideas."
rotten,This addition to the cinematic junk food action franchise doesn’t have amusing set-pieces that catch the audience’s attention.
fresh,"Fast x saved the Fast & Furious Franchise for me. Fast X brings back what I loved from Fast 5-7! Jason Momoa injects the adrenaline rush this franchise truly needed to elevate the stakes, the insanity, & family."
fresh,"We are probably facing the best 'Avengers' movie with flashy cars, sleeveless shirts, the smell of gasoline, and down-to-earth superpowers that we can savor."
fresh,"the wheels on the muscle cars keep turning even if they look worse than the Chrysler LeBaron driven by John Candy and Steve Martin in Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987). They are spectacles with no stakes, and even the spectacles are computer fakery."
rotten,Fast X is elevated by the presence of Aquaman and a flagrant disregard for human constraints like “good taste.” It’s the best film in the Fast & Furious series to kind of watch out of the corner of your eye while doing something else.
rotten,"None of these expensively assembled elements fit together as a coherent story... it's difficult to argue that a film that cost a reported $350million can justify being ""so bad it's good""."
fresh,"The car chases are first-rate, still finding creative if not plausible ways to hurl cars at people, off mountains, and sometimes at each other."
fresh,I'm still having fun with this completely ridiculous universe but Fast is (puts on sunglasses) running out of gas.
fresh,"While Fast X still delivers on propulsive stunts and fan service, as the 10th instalment and with the promise (or is that a threat?) of at least two more, it’s starting to run out of road."
rotten,Out of gas. Spinning its tires. Stuck in the ditch. Slid too far off the road. Grinding its gears. Crashed and burning with one wheel spinning. Insert your automobile cliche here.
fresh,"I've been a fan since ""F&F1"" and it is still a great ride."
fresh,"The best thing about this movie is Jason Momoa. He just said ""You know what, guys? I'm going to pull the top off this one and let it rip."""
fresh,"This film is very entertaining but not especially good. That's OK, because if you're a fan of this series I think you'll be happy with what you get."
fresh,"Fast X is the first chapter of the end — and it's a completely ridiculous, self-aware, bloated act of fan service that's pretty damn entertaining."
fresh,"After 10 films and a spinoff, fans who’ve been along for the ride will find this joyride a blast with scenes that feel like throwbacks to their favourite characters, locations, and car chases."
fresh,"There are certain obvious pitfalls to such a story, and while “Fast X” definitely still feels like a fun ride, it can’t help but get caught up in doing too much at once, which is really saying something for a film in this franchise."
fresh,"If you’ve stuck with the ‘Fast and Furious’ franchise for 12 years, then this is just as enjoyable as the previous entries."
fresh,Fast X does everything you want to see out of a Fast & Furious movie.
fresh,"If it weren’t for Jason Momoa, Fast X would be as unbearable as the last few Fast films, but thank the gods for him, because he is the shot in the arm this franchise desperately needed."
fresh,"Like many previous F&F movies, this one is a globe-trotting action and spy thriller, much like the James Bond movies. The action scenes in this movie are sometimes crazy, but not as crazy as they were in F9. Action is the only reason to watch this movie."
rotten,"Fast X continues the franchise’s mission to scale bigger and campier heights, and there are moments that will have you full-volume hooting and hollering in your seat, but it’s undone by the gravest sin of this cinematic universe: it breaks up the family."
fresh,A mindless & excessive trippy ride that entertains.
rotten,"Senseless, recycled, cliche-clogged screenplay that's frenetic and futile...wheely, wheely stupid - but it does tease the return of Dwayne Johnson in the next round."
fresh,Jason Momoa steals the show.
fresh,It's been a long time on the road but Jason Momoa's maniac villain gives the franchise a jolt.
fresh,"At 142 minutes, you do get your money’s worth."
fresh,An appealingly sincere spectacle.
fresh,"It's convoluted and silly, and comic-book-y... I can say all those things but I'm not being pejorative about any of it. It's exactly what you want from a big action-crazy cartoon."
rotten,Universal’s 11th Fast & Furious movie is essentially a thinly plotted telenovela that’s way more fixated on feelings and family than cars.
rotten,Mildly more tolerable than the previous two entries but only when the pedals are pushed and a few punches are thrown. Momoa is emulating Cage in Face/Off and is having fun but any word spoken by any other alpha male is deadly dull as usual.
fresh,"After 22 years, the Fast and Furious franchise finally gets a memorable villain in Fast X, thanks to Jason Momoa. This series needs an adversary as gonzo as its off-the-wall antics, and bless Momoa for going the extra mile and then some."
rotten,"There's really no need to be watching these anymore. At one point, their silliness was fun, but now it's just stupid."
fresh,"I’ve seen all ten films, you know what you’ll get with these movies—they are family-centered, outrageous cars, eye-popping visual stunts, and wild rides, plus a new outstanding villain, Dante--if you go in with that expectation, you should be entertained."
rotten,"Momoa's Dante is at first a lively and welcome departure from the series’ previous forgettable villains, until he slips into offensive stereotypes."
rotten,A typically underwhelming entry within an underwhelming series...
fresh,"It’s fair to wonder how much tread is left on this franchise’s tires, but Fast X is just relentlessly entertaining enough to keep things afloat before the grand finale."
fresh,"This franchise never disappoints on the heart stopping stunts, fight sequences and star power.  This time the new faces, in addition to the core four, are Rita Moreno as Abuelita and Jason Momoa as Dante who steal the show."
fresh,"Like the previous episodes, the Fast X script contains inside jokes, self-conscious dialogue, scenes that border melodrama, and action sequences that raise the bar for implausibility (something we all expected... [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It’s overlong and over-the-top, but the real trouble is that when a series like this starts acknowledging its its own absurdities, they become harder to enjoy."
rotten,It’s incredible how this franchise has been implanted into the pop culture event film psyche. These films are forgone into the sanctums of exciting absurdity that you have to see at least how they wrap all of this up.
fresh,"Big, dumb, stupid fun…the best one since Furious 7, but that doesn’t mean it’s perfect."
fresh,"Overall, Fast X is a solid action flick, pulling out all the stops from car chases, explosions, aircraft, and some intense and lengthy fight sequences."
rotten,"Fast X manages to be bigger and more bonkers than any of the previous entries in the franchise, but it's still a bit rubbish."
fresh,"Not as great as the previous Fast films but it still delivers high-octane action as one would expect (and look forward to) in a Fast film. The story gets a bit convoluted in the 3rd act, and with the party split, it was missing that family dynamic."
fresh,"As long as you keep your expectations low with Fast X, you won’t come out as disappointed as I was with this fairly crowded and standard-issue entry."
fresh,While Diesel still has the acting range of a flat battery — and no one ever wears a seatbelt yet they come out of collisions unscathed — it’s still one hell of a ride on the big screen.
fresh,"If action/adventure fans are willing to throw logic out the window, they’ll like what they see."
rotten,"There's nothing much left in the tank. Cars and humans are entirely indestructible, our heroes time and time again emerge from certain incineration without a scratch or blister -- the sheer ridiculousness matched only by my sheer boredom."
rotten,The series that keeps on grinding away even though the creativity tank hit E a few chapters back.
fresh,It’s amazing. It does everything it says it will do and there are no upper (or lower) limits to what this franchise will do to center family over everything.
fresh,"Of course you know it's going to be fantastical, a little silly, and completely unrealistic, but this is the kind of big screen popcorn flick we like to go to the movies and see."
fresh,"A big, loud, dumb sequel that feels like it’s taking the franchise down a dead end from which it will never return, but ridiculous action scenes and an iconic performance from Jason Momoa save the day."
fresh,"Honestly, I’d be surprised if it even ends there. We will probably get five more last Fast movies. Why even keep up the charade that these are ending? Let’s just all admit these will never end."
rotten,"Leterrier's achievement in assembling such a gargantuan, multi-stranded, globe-trotting, head-spinning blockbuster is impressive, but however many gruff sermons Dom makes about his family, it's impossible to care about any of it."
rotten,"Your job, should you choose to accept it. Sit through a movie that batters as much as at buoys and which has gotten so stuffed, it barely has room to accommodate the characters that once gave it a bit of humanity."
fresh,"Fast X keeps its hands on the wheel for another bombastic addition to the family! Rump shaking, fist pumping and explosive!"
fresh,"Successfully upholds the Fast & Furious franchise's legacy with expertly choreographed, high-octane action. An exhilarating cinematic experience; thoroughly engaging."
rotten,"Like the Marvel franchise, this series has driven itself into a dead end, giving the audience what they want without anything new or surprising."
rotten,"The action sequences, fight scenes, and redundant head-scratching returns of characters are overdone to the point of exhaustion. That includes Momoa’s much-heralded villainous turn."
rotten,"It's a LOT of movie, favouring quantity over quality. More characters, more Hollywood stars, more fights, more explosions, more digital effects, more flashbacks, more actions that defy the laws of physics... more everything! Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"The plot is too bloated by an enlarged cast, all of whom demand moments to shine in the sun, and a desire to outdo the prior installment's over the top special effects."
fresh,And the two action set pieces that bookend its story are too wonderfully over the top to be spoilt by Louis Leterrier’s pell-mell direction.
fresh,"What Fast X embodies is the often-goofy amiability of the American blockbuster, and the innate charm that still gives it global appeal without the requisite amount of compromises that may assume it may need in our world-spanning modern cinema."
fresh,"Fast X is unquestionably fun, even when it’s at its most unbelievable. With each passing sequence, you find yourself somewhere between rolling your eyes and grinning, knowing how preposterous it is and yet forgiving it anyway."
fresh,"It’s not the characters but the situation they are thrown into that’s grand, and to experience it in a theatre is enjoyable."
rotten,The end of the line is becoming much more glaring as the tank truly starts running out of gas.
fresh,"This is what summer movies should be! It's spectacular! It's thrilling! And it's the kind of movie you can't wait to yammer about to your friends. Truly, I walked out of Fast X with a big Momoa smile on my face, so wide it hurt."
fresh,"It is business as usual, as this unwieldy beast of a movie jet-sets around the world, destroying everything in its path, while ensuring sufficient screen time for each member of its bloated, star-studded cast."
rotten,"There is no sense of revelation, no sense of surprise or burst of creative energy. Instead of seeing something new and exciting, we’re served yesterday’s leftovers."
fresh,"Big, loud and very self aware, the latest FF entry is both fun & frustrating. No longer about good storytelling, stakes are low, stupidity is high, and burnout is starting to set in. It's time for the franchise to end."
fresh,A garish celebration.
rotten,"Despite boasting a healthy 141-minute running time, Fast X is not a complete movie."
rotten,"Written, it seems, from the mind of an 8-year-old..."
rotten,"These movies are all starting to repeat themselves. Watch this one for the spectacle and Jason Momoa, who is straight up a comic book supervillain."
fresh,"Fast X hits all the expected (and now familiar) tropes and beats, but this being the first in a multi-movie story, it is ultimately a little underwhelming… but regardless, we will all return for the next chapter like the dutiful cult members we are."
fresh,"[Jason Momoa] is the glorious future of the Fast franchise, and we are furious it took this long for his debut."
rotten,"The increasingly predictable, self-referential nature of the storytelling makes every subsequent film feel like a parody of itself—the cinematic equivalent of drifting around in circles."
rotten,Discount action movie slurry.
fresh,"…the cheerful gang-show mentality still invests Fast and Furious franchise entries with an easy-going, undemanding guilty-pleasure charm, but it’s wearing a little thin by movie ten…"
fresh,"Even with the lack of family togetherness, resolve and behind-the-scenes faults, Fast X delivers exactly what fans would expect in terms of action and absurdity while surprising us with an entertainingly over-the-top Jason Momoa performance."
fresh,"Just when I thought this series was out of gas, Fast X hit the nitrous boost."
fresh,"Much of Fast X is lots of fun, and the dynamics between the characters are as satisfying as ever"
fresh,"Is Fast X a good movie? Probably not. But is it a good time, that delivers exactly what the audience wants? Most definitely."
fresh,"Fast X continues to deliver big, loud & dumb entertainment but it's diminishing returns with a forced and frustrating cliffhanger. Momoa's villain is a blast while the script, dialogue, and soap opera drama is among the weakest of the franchise."
rotten,"The 10th official movie in this wildly popular franchise -- the first of a two-parter -- has the same, now-somewhat-tired formula: travel, stunts, fights, explosions, crashes, ""family"" talk, repeat."
fresh,"The tenth installment is more of the same gravity-defying stunts and laughable dialogue but Jason Momoa fuels the action with humor. The script is also filled with fun moments that poke fun at the ""familia"" and the ridiculous car stunts."
fresh,"It is 3 different movies at once. All lacking in logic, plot, and coherent character development. Yet somehow still a campy fun ride. Momoa makes for a flamboyant injection of life. Action wise the set pieces fail to meet the bar set by previous entries."
rotten,We are at the point where we have to question what is going on here. Fast X is an empty experience and one of the worst entries in a spectacular franchise.
fresh,"This is by far the most ridiculous installment in the Fast & Furious franchise, and remember they drove a car into space in the last one."
rotten,"It starts firing on all cylinders, but it's tiring mechanics take us along winding roads, better traveled in the past. A well-oiled amusement park ride in its day, the franchise is increasingly feeling like a creaking carousel. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Pigs are flying, hell has frozen over, and monkeys are flying out of Wayne Campbell’s butt, because they finally made one of these that I enjoyed."
fresh,"Fast X delivers on upping the ante with the explosions and intricate fight choreography that will leave you pumped up. Charmingly, though, where the film hooks you most is the heart and love of family."
rotten,"A tad better than the previous film, yet still one of the weakest entries of the whole franchise. Come for more absurd, silly action hijinks, stay for Jason Momoa's flashy, bonkers Dante Reyes - best villain of the series. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Its focus on shooting up adrenaline levels and on an impressive execution of the action, this time around directed by Louis Leterrier, is nullified by a script that doesn't seek anything new, just recycles and upsizes. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The franchise hasn’t quite yet run out of ways to combine cars, guns, planes, and explosions… but perhaps it’s good that there are maybe only two films left until the franchise officially “ends.”"
rotten,"“Fast X” is dumb, ugly, and awkward. It is goofy in the bad way, not goofy in the awesome way or goofy in the “Gawrsh!” way, either of which would have been better."
fresh,"When you stage a car chase scene in the beginning that involves a flaming giant bowling ball bomb smashing through Rome, it's exhausting trying to sustain that type of velocity through the entire film. But Jason Momoa's fabulous villain makes it worth it."
rotten,"Dom -- and the film -- are so relentless with the notion of whatever family means, it all begins to feel like so much sentimentalist drivel, a colorfully patterned carpet designed to distract you from all the people losing money at the slot machines."
rotten,"... It’s more like a Vanity Fair party than a movie — yet only a splendid new villain (Jason Momoa) seems to be having any real fun. Luckily, he’s fabulous."
fresh,"Fast newcomer Louis Letterier, ever a big-dumb-movie workman, siphons enough goofy energy from some of his previous blockbusters to inject some verve back into this lumbering series."
fresh,Despite its flaws...I—as a big fan of the entire Fast Saga—still had a lot of fun.
fresh,"Fast X isn't just a movie, it's a madman's dream, a celebration of the self-referential blockbuster, and yet, it takes itself ridiculously seriously... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Szifron and his co-writer Jonathan Wakeham play it too safe, creating an aggressively stale procedural that doesn’t pack the gut punch it wants to deliver."
fresh,"The search for a serial-killer uncovers the dirt of contemporary American society in To Catch a Killer, the first feature and a very solid film in Hollywood by Argentine Damián Szifron. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,You can call off the manhunt —  the script is the real killer here.
fresh,"Szifron's movie recalls the best of David Fincher by being able to create a fast-paced hunt loaded with psychological elements. Also, it adds small touches of acid humor typical of his work. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Labyrinthine, raw, cerebral and full of tension, To Catch a Killer is an enjoyable study of human chaos. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The story is efficient until the final act stumbles with different revelations. It works, but it's too conventional. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,A competent thriller. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"It is a dutiful but impersonal film, very different from Szifron's previous production, who we know is capable of doing something much more original, interesting and visually impressive. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,Shailene Woodley is out of her element here and given no help from a screenplay that would like to exist in the same universe of The Silence of the Lambs' feminine viewpoint but gives all the best stuff to Ben Mendelsohn.
fresh,a solid procedural that efficiently and engagingly moves through its relatively predictable plot points
fresh,Szifron approaches his work with invention and panache and this film is just so good-looking and atmospheric.
fresh,"While there is not much wrong with this solid crime procedural set in present-day Baltimore, there [is] nothing too remarkable about it either."
fresh,It’s a must for fans of gritty thrillers.
rotten,Exciting premise of catching a serial killer but Shailene Woodley walks trough her role.
rotten,"To Catch a Killer falters in its final act as it delves into the killer's motives, thereby attempting to elicit sympathy from the audience. This narrative choice ultimately weakens the film, detracting from its earlier strengths and diluting its impact."
rotten,"The opening of Damián Szifron’s To Catch a Killer sets viewers up for what looks to be a taut cat-and-mouse chase... However, that isn’t what the bulk of this thriller entails."
rotten,It’s moody but very messy.
rotten,"If this film is remembered for anything, it will be marking the end of actor Ben Mendelsohn’s hot streak. You used to be able to tell a worthwhile watch from his presence. No longer."
fresh,To Catch a Killer works as a police procedural with just enough intrigue to stop it from feeling like a paint-by-numbers crime drama. It wants to make a bold statement about the cultural atmosphere that breeds killers but fails to commit to the cause.
rotten,"The mystery is engaging, and the acting is all top-notch, but eventually, the plot fails to deliver the result you expected."
rotten,"A dark, draggy police procedural that... proves to be considerably less profound and powerful than the makers imagine."
fresh,"Focused on investigating its characters, this contained, broody procedural, shares some DNA with productions like Silence of The Lambs and Mare of Easttown. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,To Catch a Killer starts with the far-fetched concept that an experienced FBI agent would rely heavily on an inexperienced city police officer to help capture a mass murderer. The plot goes downhill from there.
fresh,There is an undeniable 90s vibe To Catch a Killer and it is for sure a solid Thriller. But at the same time it manages to dig deep into some of the most pressing issues in present day American Society. Great display of Szifron's talent at the helm.
rotten,"Unfortunately, To Catch A Killer doesn’t have the script -- and tries to include way too much thematic substance -- to match Szifron and Julia’s impressive visuals."
fresh,"With the pulse of an exemplary storyteller and skilful creator of tension-filled atmospheres, Szifron creates a world where easy, superficial, and malleable solutions can only push us to make irreparable mistakes. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Szifron demonstrate his masstery of dialogue constructions, in introducing characters, and in filming action sequences with intriuge or brio. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's a tenuous proposition and it leads to a denouement that challenges reason, given the sociopathy of the killer. Worse, it treats the vicious cold-blooded killer with surprising and blatantly unjustified sympathy and understanding."
fresh,... At times To Catch a Killer recalls The Wire in its exploration of bureaucracy and manipulations inside security and intelligence agencies. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Audacious, intimate, and elegant, To Catch a Killer deserves to be watched in the theaters. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Although it is a proficient crime thriller, its formulaic story doesn't set it apart from other productions of the same genre. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,...a decent-enough thriller that feels like a throwback to the similarly-themed fare of the 1990s.
fresh,"It’s been a minute since I’ve gotten a quality detective thriller in the vein of Silence of the Lambs. To Catch a Killer is not hitting hard enough to measure up to that modern classic, but it’s certainly more worthwhile than junk like The Snowman."
rotten,"While it's always a pleasure to see Woodley in anything, I fear she's been  let down by a fairly pedestrian screenplay here."
fresh,"Though the narrative sometimes lags under the weight of its message, the film is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that doesn’t shy away from the more problematic elements of the sub genre."
rotten,"With so much focus on the chase, Szifron never taps into the emotional wreckage experienced by the victims, but Woodley and Mendelsohn successfully reveal the human beings behind the badges."
rotten,A rising director and a reliable star are hampered by a limp script -- their serial killer drama shoots blanks.
fresh,"Many may be surprised that the straight-to-VOD-looking To Catch A Killer is not only very gripping but also doesn’t paint the police in a flattering light. It touches on corruption, racism and questions the system. Still, it’s too surface-level."
fresh,"And although Szifron's approach doesn't glamorize gun violence, it still feels like it could encourage a potential shooter who might be thinking about doing something similar."
fresh,"Filmmaker Damian Szifron takes an inventive visual approach, even if the ambitious script turns out to be rather pedestrian."
fresh,"Ben Mendelsohn shines, again, but thriller falls prey to lackluster finale."
fresh,"To Catch a Killer is a thriller that thrills more than other similar films do, and Shailene Woodley adds another laurel to her already impressive resume."
rotten,To Catch a Killer is not worth watching at the theatre or video on demand pricing. The film squanders a compelling and thoroughly enjoyable turn by Mendelsohn.
rotten,"Tension that had been accumulating all movie from a frightening unknown menace should be snapping hearts and necks, but it unravels."
fresh,"While the ending might not land for all, the overall delivery of the film is intense, engaging, and unforgettable."
rotten,"You can feel the film fumbling around for some sort of an explanation for this decidedly American phenomenon, but it loses its nerve somewhere along the way, abandoning any kind of stinging indictment for a wan variation on “hurt people hurt people.”"
rotten,"Szifron’s unable to put personality, verve, or distinction into To Catch a Killer."
rotten,"For the first half-hour, To Catch a Killer is outstanding. Then it gradually, consistently goes downhill."
fresh,"Yes, it's flawed. But these actors are watchable, and I'd like to see Woodley in a follow-up."
fresh,"Without descending into shrill sloganeering, the implicit anti-gun messages are weaved into the fabric of the narrative, elevating the material from the typical, limited, familiar range of police procedurals."
rotten,Its ambitions overwhelm its abilities.
rotten,"Clunky dialogue, unrealistic leaps of logic, and an unnecessarily stuffy tone ultimately sink To Catch a Killer..."
rotten,"More suspenseful than its generic title suggests, this mildly taut thriller nevertheless stumbles through formulaic procedural trappings and a ridiculous ending."
fresh,"As good as any limited series crime thriller, it begins with a bang pulling the viewer to the edge of their seat and keeping them there the entire time."
fresh,"The juxtaposition [of the filmmakers' ideas with police procedural plotting] isn't perfect, but their ability to let their characters be flawed and complex does allow our normal preconceptions born from Hollywood copaganda to get pushed aside."
fresh,Shailene Woodley and Ben Mendelsohn elevate this otherwise familiar and uneven psychological thriller.
rotten,To Catch a Killer will leave you reaching for the latest true crime podcast for the suspense that is sadly missing.
fresh,There’s nothing here that we haven’t seen executed with more creativity and style in other productions. What we get is a cover performance that knows the lyrics but lacks the soul.
fresh,"With echoes of “Silence of the Lambs,” “To Catch a Killer” presents some thorny philosophical and political questions along with its puzzling mystery."
rotten,"These filmmakers ultimately take on a lot more than they can handle, but for a while, the real-world concerns and anxieties ... make it fairly compelling."
rotten,The small amount of action scenes are quite exciting but the film drops its audience off for such long periods of talking tedium that any interest becomes void.
fresh,"There’s no shortage of entertaining moments in To Catch a Killer, but that won’t stop audiences from wanting more."
rotten,"Hyper-focusing on putting together a modus operandi is interesting, but weak themes, excessive side stories, and underexplored characters surround it"
fresh,"Still, it follows the beats you expect from a film called To Catch a Killer about an unsung but brilliant cop finding her legs as an investigator. The film can never fully escape that dull familiarity."
rotten,"The tone and style are strangely hard to pin down: it seems stuck somewhere between a cold Fincher procedural and flashy, sleazy De Palma thriller."
rotten,"Unfortunately, grandiose fireworks and scathing close-ups aren’t enough to rescue To Catch a Killer from committing the cardinal sin of a psychological thriller: It’s a little dull."
fresh,Szifron’s stylish way with the visuals are hard to ignore.
rotten,It squanders any chance for succeeding by its lame script.
fresh,"There are times when the feature feels frighteningly real, truly capturing what’s going on in the modern realm of mental illness and media overload."
rotten,"A slick and stylish, but vapid and undercooked crime thriller with a dull and forgettable villain. If The Silence of the Lambs or The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo were the A-movie in a double feature, To Catch a Killer would be the inferior B-movie."
fresh,"A solid investigative procedural that breaks no new ground, but delivers sufficient suspense, character interest, and action in confident fashion."
fresh,"“To Catch a Killer,” despite its mundane and forgettable title (originally titled “Misanthrope”) is actually quite good, if not great. It is a tension-killed drama about a serial killer that is at its best when focused on the two leads."
rotten,I have never seen a thriller pair-up people who shouldn't be paired-up and yet are paired-up anyway managed less gracefully.
rotten,"To Catch a Killer isn’t as strong as its predecessors, but it’s backed by great performances and sequences even when it leans into implausibility."
fresh,To Catch a Killer is a consistently compelling serial killer procedural with some intriguing performances.
rotten,The characters need a personality infusion and the killer’s motivation is on life support.
rotten,"A watered-down notch in the belt of psychological serial killer dramas in the vein of everything from Silence of the Lambs to Zodiac, even The Dark Knight and The Batman. Imitation? It’s not always the highest form of flattery."
rotten,"Seiya's attempts at wisecracking fall flat and, as for the plot holes, supplemental manga-reading may be required to fill in the gaps. This wasn't worth the wait."
rotten,No amount of martial arts choreography or special effects can compensate for a weak script.
rotten,"Otherwise, it should have gone as gritty as Robert Rodriguez did with Alita Battle Angel. As it stands, Knights of the Zodiac looks and feels like a compromise designed to kickstart a franchise that seems unlikely to happen."
rotten,Three screenwriters were necessary to write a tremendously simple plot told in the most complex way possible. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Knights of the Zodiac remains as one more title in the list of failed live action anime adaptations. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The acting is never really bad, just indifferent. Even old pros Bean and Janssen can’t summon up much enthusiasm for this silliness."
rotten,There are occasional visuals that are very striking... But it's an absolute mess of a big-budget spectacle.
fresh,"The Saint Seiya adaptation, Knights of the Zodiac, works best when it leans into slick action and lets its cast cut loose."
rotten,This lack of an engaging plot means the film becomes a soulless series of adventures and fight sequences with no heart or motivation behind them other than good versus evil.
rotten,All mythology and no soul.
rotten,"The defanged action sequences don’t leave an impact, and what was once an engaging story about Greek myths and destiny has been downgraded into a cliched battle between technology and faith/magic."
rotten,"It will neither satisfy the fandom’s demands for a true-to-the-bone homage to their childhood favorite, nor will it transmit to outsiders why this tale of blind courage in the face of insurmountable odds has inspired such decades-long devotion."
fresh,"It is much too self-serious at times, but the visuals and action sequences are boldly portrayed with little fear of ridicule or shame of its origins."
fresh,"Strong role models in uneven, violent manga-based actioner."
rotten,"The narrative and characters are swallowed by a storm of ill-conceived CGI and unfortunate writing, another title in the long list of live-action anime adaptations that should deter similar future attempts."
rotten,Knights of the Zodiac fails to inspire enough excitement to meet the prospect of future sequels with its lackluster visual effects and rather clunky storytelling.
fresh,Knights of the Zodiac is secretly brilliant in its holistic understanding of what makes anime appealing as a medium.
rotten,"What's missing, essentially, is some kind of personality to take the edge off just how routine and formulaic this tale is..."
rotten,"Overlong, clunky and anemic while failing to deliver palpable thrills."
rotten,Knights of the Zodiac is an example of everything wrong when a manga-based anime TV series turns into a horribly acted live-action movie that will make even die-hard fans cringe. There are bad video games that are more entertaining than this boring flop.
rotten,"Sets up for a franchise... but do we want one? With shoddy CGI and a messy story, most viewers will pass at the idea."
rotten,An otherwise potential franchise starter that fizzles in its first live-action movie.
rotten,"Polish director Tomasz Baginski and his team TRIED—they tried to respect the original story, and they tried to keep the same spirit and tone as the hugely popular anime. They didn't get it 100% right, but the intention is clear. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,This adaptation of Masami Kurumada's manga clearly has ambitions of being the beginning of a franchise. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"I laughed, I laughed some more, and I nearly died at certain points… but through all the satirical material there is true heart to the entire film… as well tense themes that make us look at ourselves. DiCaprio is incredible"
rotten,Disaster film is a fitting title because this film was a disaster.
rotten,On par with a mediocre SNL sketch.
fresh,Don't Look Up hilariously approaches almost every theme worthy of discussion through Adam McKay's satirical screenplay that will undoubtedly leave viewers either incredibly satisfied or extremely triggered.
rotten,Don’t Look Up doesn’t give any space for the viewer to breathe. The film is chaotic and cluttered as only some characters are used to serve a narrative purpose.
fresh,"Incredibly effective, and it was nice to see the craziness of the world we’re living in portrayed as how it actually feels to live in it; often frustrating but usually ridiculous at how oblivious and indifferent most people are..."
rotten,Despite some clever gags... the film ultimately runs out of steam and fails to make a deep impact.
fresh,"How I learned to stop worrying and love Don’t Look Up? Adam McKay’s film is a savage American political satire and the best since Wag the Dog. In his own words, he timed that shit perfectly."
fresh,Don’t Look Up calls out institutional indifference to impending disaster with relatable and riveting rage thanks to a scorching script and engaged ensemble.
fresh,"There’s so much crammed into this movie, and it’s a miracle that (for the most part) McKay manages to hold it all together."
rotten,"It's merely stating what everyone has already observed for the past two years, and delivering it with a shit-eating grin."
fresh,"A satire that at times reaches a revitalizing elegance and at others seems to emulate the level of discourse and debate in social media, television, and family tables: rough, raw, superficial, and even vulgar. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Initially, the satire has a few funny moments... But I can't remember anything else. For this reason, I can't judge it fairly. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Although I tend to agree with McKay’s worldview and identify with his cynicism about politics, media culture, and humanity’s general short-sightedness, his methods as a filmmaker rarely convince me. Don’t Look Up might be the exception."
fresh,"Like ""The Big Short"" and ""Vice,"" McKay's latest film pulls no punches in his political commentary, as he continues to make some excellent points but in a primarily condescending manner to his viewers who already received the message long ago."
rotten,"The bulk of the movie is played for gags before the serious stuff kicks in at the end. Its never easy for a director to reconcile such contrasting tones, and McKay is no exception."
fresh,Its still sadly rare to see female characters working in STEM given the grace to be imperfect on screen.
rotten,Don’t Look Up ultimately feels like just one more disaster movie: it is far easier—and maybe even more fun—to imagine the apocalyptic end of the world than to imagine how we could live in a radically different way now to prevent it.
fresh,"I thought this was a brilliant film, the satire was on message. It's this kind of court jester-like satire that I really resonate with, and the cast was spectacular. (Steve)"
rotten,"Unfortunately, McKay and Sirota remain shy and hide behind shallow and often silly humor. Despite this, many will very much come to enjoy and perhaps even love this film."
rotten,"The blitheness with which McKay approaches his noble pet subjects is not unlike Kendall Roys dedication to performing rap songs in Succession, which McKay also produces."
rotten,"You dont believe anything that happens in this film. The moments are rendered in rather cartoonish fashion; for a film invested in tackling the zeitgeist, I dont think it quite gets how people act in times of crisis."
fresh,"Overall, its intentions are too noble to call it a flop, but I still cant understand how so many awards bodies are slobbering all over it with accolades. Not everything with Leonardo DiCaprio and Meryl Streep in it is immediately Oscar-calibre, folks."
rotten,Dont Look Up is as entertaining as watching your most obnoxious relative rant at the family during a holiday dinner.
rotten,"But despite all the glitter, this satirical disaster movie about a comet hurtling toward Earth doesnt shine."
fresh,"DiCaprio and Lawrence are phenomenal and lead an all-star cast in this showy satire where science, politics and human nature clash in response to an imminent disaster. Full Review in Spanish"
fresh,"Don't Look Up bites off a bit more than it can chew, but there's a certain thrill to its massive scope and all-over-the-place narrative."
rotten,"In making Dr. Strangelove... Stanley Kubrick largely ignored what “the media” would say; he focused on the donut, the government, not the hole. McKay focuses on the hole, the media, and then decries the void."
rotten,"The films underlying message that humanity is carelessly barreling toward its own extinction and that we should be paying more attention reeks not only of self-importanceyeah, uh, we know?but also of a lack of self-awareness."
fresh,McKay has made a satire thats simultaneously funny and depressing. I started off my viewing chortling over a running gag regarding snacks and ended with a feeling of hopelessness.
fresh,"""Don't Look Up"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" in achieving lasting political satire brilliance, but it does mirror the times in which it was produced."
rotten,Theres a leanness to the best movie comedy that McKays filmmaking has lost...
fresh,"As the most risible responses to the virus outbreak become commonplace and normalized, sometimes it takes sardonic, albeit unnuanced allegory to snap us back to reality."
fresh,"Don't Look Up shows us what happens if we wait too long to interrogate our culture and ourselves, lose sight of truth, and fail to take action."
fresh,"McKay is doing more than preaching to the converted. He's reminding us of just what an enormous ask it is, especially in the digital era, to get anyone to heed an inconvenient truth."
fresh,[T]hought-provoking and engaging ... revels in the bleakness of its premise even as it mines said premise for humor.
fresh,"There is actually much to unpack in this film. A social media friend called it ""ridiculous."" But that is the whole point, you see. We have the data."
fresh,"Funny, timely, and a reminder that humans are responsible for our own demise. Solid acting all around."
fresh,...perhaps the aggravation of a movie like Don't Look Up is a good thing.
fresh,"In the end, whichever way you feel about the movie's manipulations, it's difficult to watch without being strongly affected."
rotten,"Here's a quick-and-easy lesson for the next time: if the end credits sequence is sixteen minutes long, the movie is part of the problem, not the solution."
rotten,"In Don't Look Up, Adam McKay's attempts at satire are smothered by the smugness of his screenplay."
fresh,Don't Look Up takes a big dare and earns attention that seems fair. Fine actors get into their parts while slinging extra-sharpened darts.
rotten,"McKay has little trust in his audience or his characters. The film bellows its argument at us: the world is terrible, and we are doomed if we do not change. Few would dispute this. But a good argument isn't enough to make a good movie."
fresh,"an entertainingly broad-side-of-the-barn satire that may be exactly the film we deserve in the post-Trump Presidency wasteland of COVID infections, science denialism, QAnon conspiracies, and locked-horns political turmoil"
fresh,Don't Look Up captures the culture of banality. It focuses on the shallowness and tackiness of the human race.
fresh,"This amusing black comedy is about a serious problem (global warming), but the astronomical aspects seem suspect, even on my first viewing."
rotten,"Expensive and way overlong, the film hits the same joke again and again, well past the point has been made. The"
fresh,"I laughed a lot while also feeling sick to my stomach. As subtle as a sledgehammer, almost obnoxious... and yet it might as well be a documentary. Is it elegant? Is it art? Who the f*** cares?"
fresh,"Meryl Streep is wonderful, and she's joined in her wonderfulness by Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry, both hilarious, as program hosts on a spiky news channel. The world is going to end, but how do I look on camera three?"
fresh,What's interesting about Don't Look Up is that it has tapped like a tree root into the great subterranean sea of sadness around the changing world.
fresh,"The people who need to see this movie won't see it, but those of us who don't need to see it will get a kick out of it. I did. It's sad, but I laughed a lot at the satire."
fresh,"Clever, often brilliant, luxuriously but pointedly cast, sprawling - I was never bored but I understand the plea for the shedding of 20 or so minutes - and stylishly filmed."
rotten,"Don't Look Up is a fun movie when you watch it as a casual comedy with a powerful cast telling a ridiculous story. However, things start falling apart when you see the movie as a commentary or satire to real-world events."
rotten,The film's negativity indicts McKay and insults his audience.
rotten,"Don't Look Up spends an inordinate amount of its time mocking a web phenomenon that's ubiquitous and requires very little effort to explain, virality."
rotten,The result is demonstrative and with little appeal. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,A comedic satire about the end of the world has to be brilliant to work. This movie isn't brilliant.
fresh,"""Don't Look Up"" is the best American film of 2021."
fresh,"You can't completely ruin a great concept, and McKay has hit on one...This is the way the world ends; not with a bang, but a bluster."
rotten,"To some extent the satirical discourse on the environmental crisis and the ignorant side of capitalism works well, but at times I have the feeling that everything becomes uselessly redundant. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Don't Look Up is a sizzling, coruscating, and biting satire on the modern world and our collective priorities."
rotten,"Ultimately, Don't Look Up is more than just mean-spirited and smug. It's aggressively those things -- that is, until that sentimental coda."
fresh,"The humour of the movie is often broad and preposterous, but sharp enough to keep its dark edge."
fresh,"A brilliantly scripted, wonderfully acted, and depressingly realistic satire of the environment America currently finds itself in, and the threat it poses not just to the country, but to the future of humanity."
rotten,"A star-studded misfire that is smug, irritating, and borderline intolerable."
rotten,"Although the film is undoubtedly sharper than [McKay's] previous political feature, VICE, the same smugness and cocksure piety blunt the more incisive moments, just as many performances are pitched more for caricature than satire."
rotten,Melodramatic subplots emerge that contribute nothing. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,That film tried so tirelessly and relentlessly to scold us for not listening to it that it forgot to forge a powerful work of art for those who were attending.
rotten,The agitation and quick cuts allow for the film - at 2 hours 25 minutes - to not feel longer and more laboured than the runtime suggests.
rotten,"Ideally, Don't Look Up would make you laugh AND inspired to learn more about climate change. As it is, it mostly makes you tired."
rotten,"""Don't Look Up"" is 2021's ""Mars Attacks!"""
fresh,"Dear Adam McKay, If someone doesn't like your movie, it doesn't necessarily mean they didn't get it."
fresh,"It's not subtle, but like the killer in Se7en said, you can't just tap people on the shoulder anymore, you have to hit them with a sledgehammer. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,There's a shorthand that makes each character's real world avatar easy to get and laugh at but that also undermines the film's intelligence. This is not smart satire.
fresh,"Though it is not always smooth sailing, there is more here to like than not."
fresh,"It's as dark and nasty as it needs to be, and it's a glorious thing."
fresh,"Although the satire shoots fish in a barrel, it's still an incisive piece of symbolism for all of our ongoing powder kegs, with society lighting up near the fuses. Adam McKay!"
fresh,"As a satire on corporate greed, media ethics and celebrity culture it's pretty limp. All bite but no teeth, you could say. Still, as an intermittently amusing lark to stream on your 60-inch Don't Look Up passes muster as OK time-killing fodder."
fresh,"I see and applaud [the film's] intention, but the execution isn't exactly the best. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Sometimes the sharp jabs from its script hit the target, [but] the all-star cast can only carry the silliness so far."
rotten,"McKay's movies are not particularly pointed in their satire and, as time has gone on, have increasingly settled into their preferred form of a harangue."
rotten,"Despite a to-die-for cast and a seemingly can't-miss premise, Don't Look Up is a failure on too many levels and, although the viewing numbers may satisfy Netflix, it's a shock to see such a high-profile film self-destruct."
rotten,"If I wanted to get preached at, I'll just go to church."
fresh,DiCaprio and Lawrence are a delight to watch as they lead the charge with Blanchett and Streep providing the icing on the cake.
rotten,"American humour, into well-intentioned but poorly made Hollywood quasi-activism. I'm on your side, McKay, mate. Just try to do better please!."
fresh,"Very silly, yet undeniably urgent. I loved every second."
fresh,The new Idiocracy we deserve.
rotten,"...the big, bloated, 'n' starry Netflix satire..."
rotten,This satirical film spreads itself far too thin in an attempt to cover numerous issues.
fresh,"McKay's vision leaves no room for metaphors when tackling the ill prepared politics and technological messiahs that are always willing to benefit from whatever crisis the world might be dealing with. Whether it is an asteroid, a pandemic or whatever."
rotten,"Remember when McKay was making movies like Step Brothers? Now he's making movies like Vice and Don't Look Up, glib, unfunny infomercials that are closer to Ted Talks than Talladega Nights."
fresh,"Please ignore that instruction - or else you'll miss out on a so-sharp-it-hurts satire that skewers our current state of politics, technology and celebrity culture within the context of an asteroid headed to Earth"
fresh,...an uneven endeavor that nevertheless remains quite watchable from start to finish.
rotten,"Nobody likes to be hit over the head with anything. The first hour was promising, but it quickly became repetitive & verbose. Don't Look Up is not nearly as shrewd nor smart as it obviously think it is."
fresh,"Adam McKay offers a riff on the sad state of contemporary American politics and media via a spoof on disaster movies...and though his approach...is heavy-handed rather than sharp, enough zingers land for it to squeeze by."
rotten,"Don't Look Up is a blunt instrument in lieu of a sharp razor, and while McKay may believe that we're long past subtlety, it doesn't mean that one man's wake-up-sheeple howl into the abyss is funny, or insightful, or even watchable."
rotten,"This isn't just a noble failure, it's a flat out bad film, an attempt to address a very real planetary crisis in the simplest and most misguided terms."
rotten,"McKay has made it inescapably clear that, no matter who you are... he is serenely confident that he is much smarter than you are."
rotten,The film raises a fundamental question if we truly intend to analyze its effectiveness: how to satirize something that has already become absurd to the point of defying any common sense? [Full review in Portuguese]
fresh,"Distracted society? Distracted movie. Don't Look Up can feel like the most expensively produced sketch-comedy show in history, but most of the bits hold both guffaws as well as gnawing elements: McKay seeks inconvenient sooth."
rotten,"Yelling ""Look at all the dumb-dumbs"" cannot be the basis for successful satire."
fresh,"Big, long, fun--and disturbing. It ain't Paddy Chayefsky or Armando Iannucci but it hits the nail on the head, is very satisfying--and will age well."
fresh,"The result, while amusing and entertaining at times, feels more like shooting fish in a barrel rather than luring them in from deep in the sea."
fresh,"""Don't Look Up"" wants to be ""Doctor Strangelove"" for a new generation but may be too ostentatious for its own good."
rotten,"Dark comedy has so much potential when it's handled right, but it's hard to fully defend an often downright unpleasant, shrill viewing experience in this genre."
rotten,McKay's contempt for pop culture is frequently tiresome; he just doesn't know how to let people enjoy things - even if it is their own destruction.
fresh,"A thought-provoking parable, both funny and sad, about the reactions to the consequences of climate change."
rotten,"""Don't Look Up"" makes a few decent points and gets a chuckle or two, but mostly, it is leaden when it could be farcical, sluggish when it could be screwball. This end of the world comedy should have just been more fun."
rotten,"The frustrating thing is not only how important the message is, but how much it shows that the cast wanted to do things right. [Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Don't Look Up gives what is probably one of the most on-the-nose assessments if the world today got the news that a comet was on a collision course with earth. While it's satire, it's a dark one, and the longer it plays the more it feels spot on."
fresh,"Director Adam McKay's star-studded Netflix film--led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence--is on the right side of the truth, but are the liars listening?"
fresh,"Think of it like a massive Hollywood Christmas special where the top talent comes together to scream, ""We're all going to f***ing die"" at the top of their lungs. Amen to that."
rotten,"[The premise is] squandered in a slapdash, scattershot sendup that turns almost everyone into nincompoops, trivializes everything it touches, oozes with self-delight, and becomes part of the babble and yammer it portrays."
rotten,"The black comic aspects of this gloomy paradox are never fully realised. I kept wishing that it had fallen into the hands of Armando Iannucci (The Death of Stalin, Veep), a social satirist with all the gifts to make it work."
fresh,"'Don't Look Up' very clearly has a lot on its mind. Ideas shoot out of it like a firehose, but there's a poetic, melancholic nature to all its insanity. One of the year's very best works!"
fresh,"In the end, McKay isn't doing much more in this movie than yelling at us, but then, we do deserve it."
fresh,"Don't Look Up doesn't have as clear of a target, so instead it swings at everyone. Its worst parts are when it stops to show people on their phones."
rotten,There's nothing more excruciating than watching very famous people work entirely too hard to be funny.
fresh,Don't Look Up is at its best when it throws the satire to the side and becomes Adam McKay's take on Melancholia.
rotten,"I had a lot of fun with this film, but this finale that supposedly concludes a nine-film franchise has to be the worst out of the entire Skywalker saga."
rotten,"Though The Last Jedi left more than one question unanswered and plenty of room for developing certain themes that are only hinted at in the film, The Rise of Skywalker strays from Johnson’s direction and takes a different path entirely."
rotten,"The lack of artistic integrity plus the constant disappointments regarding each big moment’s climax ruins one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Next time, just build a roadmap, Disney…"
rotten,"There’s a fine line between familiarity and predictability, and The Rise of Skywalker crosses that line more than any of the previous chapters. It also undoes or ignores virtually everything that occurred in The Last Jedi."
fresh,The Rise of Skywalker is a messy film that contains too much plot for its own good but also a really entertaining movie that showcases why audiences love Star Wars.
rotten,"Star Wars has lost its mystique, and The Rise of Skywalker is to blame."
rotten,"As for me: this is where I get off the Star Wars train. I was happy enough to wrap up some unfinished childhood business, although if they'd stopped at Force Awakens that would have done the job just as well."
fresh,"The story is messy, there’s enough plot to fill two movies, and some of its characters need more attention. But this is still very much a Star Wars film and will evoke many of those same old feelings of kid-like joy and excitement for those who allow it."
rotten,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the creators of the new Star Wars Trilogy must be dedicated environmentalists, because they keep recycling the same old material over and over and over."
fresh,The Rise of Skywalker is a satisfying and spectacular end to the third trilogy.
fresh,"Adam Driver as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo is the best thing the sequel trilogy gave us. The film has way too many flaws, but my fandom couldn't help to enjoy every minute of it. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Capably made but misguided in its attempts to satiate its fanbase, The Rise of Skywalker marks some kind of end to the franchise."
rotten,"The Last Jedi took some narrative risks that didnt pay off, but a follow-up that plays it safe hardly seems preferable. What should feel like an epic conclusion to a 42-year-old story instead acts as proof that the franchise has lost its way."
fresh,Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are the MVPs of Rise of Skywalker. Both give their all in their final performances as Rey and Ben Solo.
fresh,"The Rise of Skywalker might play it safer than its predecessor, The Last Jedi, but it so effective in its messages that it connects and provides a more a very satisfying conclusion."
fresh,"A noteworthy farewell to the Skywalker saga, with the heart and action we have come to love from the Star Wars franchise."
fresh,"I had a great time, I loved it!"
fresh,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the final entry in the series' nine-film Skywalker story, is the cinematic equivalent of Anakin and Obi-Wan landing that gigantic ship at the end of Revenge of the Sith's opening space battle."
rotten,"A disjointed, rushed, and incohesive mess of fan service and B genre plotting."
fresh,"The final installment in the Star Wars saga, The Rise of Skywalker, is a fitting end to more than four decades of storytelling."
fresh,"Abrams knows when and how to play the nostalgia card without getting intoxicated with it, allowing us to say goodbye to the heroes of the original saga, but without removing the focus from the real protagonists of this story [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a finale that is both enthralling and frustrating. One can only hope that future Star Wars films can explore whatever direction they please without being as beholden to the legacy that came before.
rotten,"The expected, soulless capstone of a four decade saga."
fresh,"Jam packed with action and plot, The Rise of Skywalker gets bogged down with exposition and tying up loose ends."
rotten,"The Rise of Skywalker is filled with narrative dead-ends, aborted character arcs, and generic fetch quests, all designed to please as many people as possible."
fresh,"This final installment does exactly what fans of the series want it to ... allowing nostalgia and some fun, fast, flirty fight sequences to close up a property over 40 years old."
fresh,"It's a shame the story isn't stronger, but The Rise of Skywalker is still never less than entertaining ... when it's at its best, it really does remind us why we fell in love with Star Wars in the first place."
fresh,"Is it worth the 42-year wait? No movie could live up to that expectation. Still, there are enough reminders of why you fell in love with 'Star Wars' in the first place to make you feel like a kid again"
fresh,"Attempting to reverse all of the details in the prior film, this hackneyed adventure finishes out the third ""Star Wars"" trilogy well enough, but does so in a surprisingly disappointing fashion in spite of its own positive qualities."
fresh,"The stakes are higher, the allies are scarcer, and the enemies more plentiful, building to a grand climax."
fresh,"""Far from perfect but offers enough action and heart to satisfy the majority of moviegoers."""
fresh,"More than anything, nostalgia is the driving force of the film as Abrams does his best to tie in characters and moments in this episode to Lucas' original trilogy, echoes of seminal events from those adventures."
fresh,"Remove the fan service, you will still have a heck of a genre movie here."
rotten,"A messy, and ultimately underwhelming experience, but one that feels so desperate to please that the sense you leave with is not one of anger or annoyance, but rather one of pity."
rotten,"It's somewhat artificial, a mid-term film that abruptly closes the popular space opera saga. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The Rise of Skywalker is so scared of doing something wrong that, by the end, it doesn't do much at all."
rotten,"It leaves many questions unanswered, a feeling of dissatisfaction deep in your stomach, and a strange sense of paralysing disappointment."
fresh,Spoiler alert: There are Ewoks at the end. Dancing.
fresh,"If anything, the movie plays it too safe with everything tied up too neatly, but as a final chapter for these characters, it's a solidly satisfying conclusion."
rotten,"'TROS' didn't do anything that other films and TV shows haven't, shoehorning a small but pleasant queer moment in wherever was convenient. Is too little, too late? Oh yeah. Is it something that LGBTQ+ pop culture fans are already used to? Unfortunately."
rotten,The Rise Of Skywalker is a middling affair too intent upon pleasing the fans to rid itself of its stop-go-stop rhythm.
rotten,"It is by far the weakest out of the new trilogy, and what should have been a triumphant end to the saga, The Rise of Skywalker just ends in bitter disappointment."
rotten,So much thrown at you with so little character reaction that it feels more like fanfiction.
fresh,"It is exciting, action-packed, visually impressive, lightly humorous and poignantly emotional. In short: Everything you hope a Star Wars film would be."
rotten,"It's like J.J. Abrams missed the day of scriptwriting school when they taught 'show, don't tell.'"
rotten,"This last go-round neither disappointed nor thrilled me; it just exists. There's always something going on, and that's part of the problem: there's never NOT something going on, no pause for breath, no beauty or poetry."
rotten,Rise of Skywalker is less a film and more a series of moments strung together to please a cabal of corporate overlords.
rotten,"The way Abrams and Terrio's script wrap up the entire Skywalker saga in this final chapter of ""Star Wars"" sequel trilogy left me both baffled and yes, a mixed feeling."
fresh,"A sci-fi action movie that proudly waves its spiritual and religious flag in its approach to a good v evil storyline, as it was in the beginning, and forever shall be."
fresh,"When watched with your brain turned off, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an entertaining and action-packed thrill ride."
fresh,"Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver have both honed their individual characters and chemistry to a very strong place, and their scenes together are easily the strongest in the film."
rotten,"It is trying to accomplish a lot, because it has to tie up every plotline. It has to involve every character. It has to has to take you to every planet... And so, in trying to cram in all of that, it feels very cursory and very rushed."
rotten,"This is Star Wars broken under the weight of its own importance, eating its own tail for lack of any original voices to better nourish it. It's nothing short of a tragedy."
rotten,"I haven't walked out of a franchise movie this disappointed in a while...like, was that the ending of Star Wars? Literally, like...whoever has these new movies, they have an uphill battle."
rotten,"If this new series is coming, they need to take some risks and stick to it...backtracking like this does no service to the genre."
rotten,It's pretty superficial.
rotten,"It plays like a re-run, warming over the familiar franchise teams...plagued by lazy writing and narrative freak-outs, and it's really not entertaining."
rotten,"Star Wars ends with a whimper, not the royal farewell the franchise deserved."
fresh,"This film is a satisfying conclusion. And so, faithful film fans, enjoy this last installment of the Star Wars films as we have known them."
rotten,"A good, explosion and spaceship-filled time at the cinema, but instead of a brave new direction, it was the same old stuff recycled. Ah well, still better than Episode I!"
rotten,The changing of Rey's origins really hinders the kind of epic conclusion this could have been.
rotten,"It turns out there isn't new darkness or new light - just the same old battle on franchise repeat. The galaxy is saved, once again, by a lone hero who has finally learned her rightful place in a very closed circle."
fresh,"It contributes to a major cause, but this last entry feels like a fun adventure from start to finish, and that's what this world is all about. It's not about angry fans. [Full review in Spanish]."
fresh,"But in between all of the galaxy-hopping and doodad-hunting, there's some great Star Wars here. This trilogy has been at its most effective when exploring the Skywalker legacy, and Rise of Skywalker continues that trend."
rotten,"The first half of it just feels unnecessary, with lots of wheel-spinning, and then the second half is just a lot of pandering to people who should have been ignored."
rotten,'Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker' made a lot of strange turns overlooked details in order to force this narrative to a predetermined ending
rotten,"It started to feel like a greatest hits compilation...bringing out what everyone knows...handsomely-constructed and entertaining as it was, there was an element of pandering to what the perceived fans wanted..."
fresh,"fundamentally a nostalgia machine, drawing heavily on the iconography and narrative beats of the original trilogy but with just enough of twists that it feels relatively new"
rotten,"This is a submissive, sloppy apology for a terrific movie. This is a series apologizing for itself when it didn't need to. Which just feels embarrassing."
fresh,"The best Star Wars episode since The Empire Strikes Back. With as much nostalgia as new story content, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker rose to the occasion full force. (Pun intended) - ignore the haters."
rotten,"After delivering such a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, Rian Johnson's excellent story telling was ignored, negated and just plain disrespected by JJ."
rotten,"Reverts some of the brilliant subversions of The Last Jedi. It does so in a way that feels punitive, almost as if to change is an offensive notion for the biggest movie franchise in history."
rotten,"It's hard to believe, at the culmination of 42 years and nine movies, that the last three would be essentially improvisational exercises by all directors concerned."
rotten,"Kudos to J.J. Abrams for doing something extraordinary: he has made me not care about Star Wars for the first time ever. I'm kind of relieved that it's over, because it has stopped being fun."
fresh,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a good tentpole movie for the holiday season and a fun Star Wars movie that ends on a high.
rotten,"Ultimately, this is a disappointing film on many fronts, mostly due to some seriously flawed storytelling that should not have been given the green light."
fresh,"Powerful entertainment on an enormous scale, it's the most emotionally resonant Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi in 1983."
rotten,"The franchise has become a decadent, First World subculture that allows people to enjoy a little harmless fantasy at the price of switching off one's brain and abandoning any sense of what makes a great movie."
fresh,"It's by turns delightful, muddled, cathartic, and frustrating, sometimes within the same scene. And what could be more post-1977 Star Wars than that?"
rotten,"The movie is so determined to be all things to all people that it overstuffs itself, becoming more of a Star Wars fan collage than a movie on its own terms."
rotten,"The Rise of Skywalker banks on franchise nostalgia for a finale designed to please fans while playing it safe and suffering, perhaps, as a consequence."
fresh,"J.J. Abrams had the arduous task to tie up loose ends not just for The Rise of Skywalker's two predecessors, but the entire Saga."
rotten,"The more it grafts aspects from its eight predecessors onto its frenetic, slapped-together narrative, the more impersonal it becomes."
rotten,"Neither Abrams nor Johnson, who have more than proven their skills as filmmakers on other occasions, are guilty of a trilogy's failure that, of course, originated without a true narrative purpose. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It all feels just a little underwhelming, but John Williams' done-to-death score swells to hopefully convince you that you are indeed having an awesome experience, and [Daisy] Ridley, in particular, acts her heart out."
fresh,"Not the roaring, perfect send-off we had hoped for but it's still a fun, sometimes exhilarating, adventure and helps to remind us why Star Wars will live on."
fresh,"The pacing in the first act leaves something to be desired but at the end of the day, the joy I felt watching this beloved story come to its conclusion could not be diminished. The action, the characters, and the overall world won me over one last time."
rotten,"It feels long, tiring and at times it doesn't deliver anything that can bristle the skin. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It is during this battle we have one of the most numinous moments in the Star Wars franchise... The scene lasts for about three or so seconds, but it's incredibly beautiful. The rest of the film was dead to me."
rotten,"What we got was a decent film, but not one to carry the torch of the Star Wars legacy."
fresh,There's never going to be a way to make everyone happy - particularly when it comes to some character arcs and the marginalization of others - but this film does a pretty good job of giving the people what they want.
fresh,They kind of went back to the feel of the original Star Wars. Even the heavy undertones still felt fun.
rotten,The crux of this dense narrative is a string of reveals that work at the cost of coherence and continuity with everything that has come before.
rotten,"Twenty-four hours later, I can already feel most of that movie evaporating from my memory..."
rotten,"Way safer, no doubt...the whole trilogy has been a disaster...start-to-finish, it did not happen, that's just so clear...but this is rewatchabale, more fun than Last Jedi, and it plays off nostalgia..."
rotten,"You've to have your idea, your vision, your inspiration...this is not that of the Star Wars universe. A new Star Wars movie every year...means you're going to make one whether you have an idea or not."
rotten,"There are tropes that I found frustrating, inconsistent...whatever you have going on, please let us know so we can watch accordingly!"
fresh,"42 years after the 1st StarWars opened, the final chapter of the Skywalker saga rides mostly on nostalgia & little innovative storytelling. While enjoyable and rousing at times, when it's over I was left with an overwhelming sense of meh."
fresh,"Abrams is a purely visual narrator and works with functionality and integration, and the result is classicist and dynamic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"There is value to this, of course. The problem is that it all feels a bit too calculated, as if Abrams were merely ticking off boxes instead of portraying a ""Star Wars"" world in which such attitudes are intrinsic."
fresh,The film may feel so carefully sculpted that it lacks a sense of spontaneity or earthy honesty. But its final scenes are beautifully played.
rotten,"The adventure is poorly defined and confusing, but [J.J.] Abrams doesn't expect us to be smart."
rotten,"It was fine, and hopefully means that we can start fresh with whatever Lucasfilm has on the docket for the future of this franchise."
rotten,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a film full of unoriginal action and fight sequences. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,The nitpicks are small compared to what the film gets right.
fresh,"Rey and Kylo's love-hate tête-à-tête remains front and center in ""Rise of Skywalker,"" even amid some mind-numbing periphery."
fresh,"The real Leia, the one we fell in love with, lives on inside us as she always has. She still inspires us, amuses us, moves us. And we can visit her anytime we want, at the touch of a play button."
fresh,"The overstuffed adventure makes for a reasonably satisfying conclusion to this trilogy, if not the nine-movie opus begun in 1977."
fresh,"It was entertaining and ended up giving me more than I expected, but I was't expecting much. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A sizable amount of the narrative of The Rise of Skywalker is spent specifically undoing what happened in The Last Jedi, and the result is a film that lacks forward momentum."
rotten,This was once a series that did things that no other movie franchise could; the best thing you can say about it now is that it's finally wrapped up.
fresh,There are plenty of things that are not good about this... but I still kind of enjoyed it. I'm still glad I saw it.
fresh,"There is plenty of action in this film and the actors do a good job. The story is similar to other Star Wars stories, with similar plot twists and revelations."
rotten,"In the end, I think one thing is fundamentally true about this sequel trilogy: the fact that they went in without a three-movie plan, directors who were communicating, and a story bible is a damn sin."
rotten,It was just a lot of unexplained tension. You can't just make a suspenseful dramatic scene without making me care.
rotten,"Oh, okay...they were just making things up as they went along."
rotten,"For every gasp-inducing jolt and hold-for-tears touching moment, a sense of betrayal almost always follows."
rotten,"An entertaining, yet disappointing finale to the Skywalker saga. [Full review in Spanish}"
fresh,"It does remain a broadly enjoyable film [...] At the same time it is too long, weirdly paced, and overwhelmingly too busy."
fresh,The Rise of Skywalker is a near-perfect close to the sequel trilogy that drives home the message of the franchise: hope.
rotten,"A movie based on a theme park ride is always going to be a marketing exercise, but what’s remarkable about Haunted Mansion is how uninterested it is in pretending to be anything more."
fresh,"... ""Haunted Mansion"" succeeds by being a thrill ride from start to finish, utilizing aspects of the ride naturally while telling a story of rejection, grief, and acceptance, even if it’s a little long and predictable."
rotten,"A story that mainly serves as an excuse to publicize the attraction ride, from which countless details and characters are extracted. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Yet another Disney movie based on their Magic Kingdom dark ride will inevitably feel like kiddie fare, but considering the talent in front of and behind the camera, it didn't have to be this way."
fresh,"While there's a modern twist and a less than rosy view of the world in the beginning, there's a happy ending to this tale of a paranormal tour guide while teams up with a psychic, a priest and a historian to help the hapless owner of the titular house."
rotten,"The rules surrounding everyone’s ultimate survival seem contrived and arbitrary, and the ghosts are central casting stock, from Desiccated Bride to Knights Templar to Miscast Mummy. We don’t know where the ghosts come from so everyone is confused."
rotten,"Disney’s Haunted Mansion is a fair enough choice for a family night in, experienced from the comfort of your couch, where the flaws are less glaring and the price of admission for Disney+ is cheaper."
rotten,"Where “Haunted Mansion” fails to generate laughs, it does evoke feelings of terror — mostly the fear that Disney will trot out this IP again in 20 years."
rotten,"I really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, totally, really, really, really, completely, really, really, really, really, really, really, really wanted this one to be good."
rotten,Sorry Disney. No sale. Again.
rotten,"No central theme emerges beyond a blandly generalised one about moving on from the past, which is to say that overtly at least, this Haunted Mansion plays it even safer than its 2003 predecessor."
fresh,"On a TV, I'm not sure I would have appreciated Haunted Mansion. But on a cinema screen, with a proper sound system pouring the noises in from all angles, this film really pops."
rotten,"A marked improvement over the similarly-titled 2003 film, 'Haunted Mansion' nevertheless falls at too many self-imposed hurdles to make the most of what should have been a self-sufficient recipe."
fresh,With some amazing special effects and a story a lot darker than I expected I found Haunted Mansion to be a film that certainly captures the vibe of the attraction. It really surprised me with its tone but that is what made me fall in love with it the most
rotten,"Sporadically creative, but mostly a tragic waste of talent and potential, Haunted Mansion should’ve been a much smoother ride than what is encountered here."
rotten,"It’s just unrelentingly flat in tone, and never really excites or engages the viewer in ways the filmmakers might have hoped for."
fresh,"I found it to be a pleasing, enjoyable movie, with a great cast, some funny jokes, some menacing ghosts, and a delightful production design that brought back fond memories of the Disneyland ride."
rotten,Owen Wilson is a priest who may be a man of the con rather that the cloth. He does manage to exorcise a few jokes out of a demonically unfortunate predicament.
rotten,Disney’s famous theme park attraction provides a great setting for a ghost story. Too bad the script does not provide a great ghost story.
fresh,"“Haunted Mansion” utilizes the dark ride as a springboard, but develops a unique, freestanding narrative that enhances the overall experience. That’s a neat trick."
rotten,"This remake, with a heavyweight, largely African-American cast, does a pretty decent job of blending supernatural horror with comedy and aiming it principally at children. But as popcorn entertainment it is hit-and-miss stuff... mostly miss."
fresh,"A spooky adventure that will neither chill to the bone nor frighten with delight, Haunted Mansion is a harmless romp through the horrors of its amusement namesake."
rotten,"Like “The Haunted Mansion” (the Eddie Murphy version), “Haunted Mansion” needed to start from scratch with a good horror story (paging Jordan Peele), then layer in elements from the ride."
rotten,… a star-studded corpse.
rotten,Haunted Mansion eventually segues into a hit-and-miss midsection riddled with padded-out and downright needless sequences...
fresh,"Everyone involved seems to have thoroughly understood the assignment, providing just enough depth and substance to the narrative and to the characters to be intriguing..."
rotten,'Haunted Mansion' passes like a ghost through the audience and disappears from memory shortly after.
rotten,The film misses out on its chance to become a Halloween classic due to the repeated bitterness of its comedy and a tragically underutilized cast.  [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The really frustrating factor here is that it feels like such an own-goal that should have worked, but really doesn’t."
rotten,This is a misfire that never carves out its own distinct identity.
fresh,"Satisfactorily spooky and just the right amount of scary for tweens and young teens, director Justin Simien's film is a true adaptation of the iconic Disney attraction."
rotten,"In a film littered with product placement, it's basically one big advertisement for the ride."
rotten,"Haunted Mansion was just okay. The cast was good and commentary on grief was solid but it’s held back by an unpolished script & hit-or-miss humor.   Overall, the best way to experience the Haunted Mansion would still be at Disney World."
rotten,"It's neither funny nor scary, and only undemanding moviegoers will enjoy it, or perhaps fans of Disney's theme-park ride, which is visually referenced everywhere."
fresh,"Good, honest work by talented professionals makes a corporately corrupted, deliberately mediocre film perfectly watchable."
rotten,This is a grimly efficient IP cash-in that defuses any potential scares with a hot-pink colour palette and a bunch of oddly specific and distracting product placements.
rotten,"The movie only gels once, in a sequence featuring Winona Ryder as Pat, a hilariously sour member of the heritage industry. Serenely quirky and coherent, this segment offers a haunting glimpse of what might have been."
rotten,"An improvement from its predecessor ... the film’s lasting impression will not live up to its source material, a ride which, even at just 9 minutes long, packs in more of a punch than the 2-hour feature."
rotten,"LaKeith Stanfield, Rosario Dawson and Owen Wilson are ready to entertain, and the initial spooky scares are witty enough. Eventually, though, the lack of a clear, propulsive storyline weakens everything."
fresh,"Is it a film that you'll remember in years to come? Certainly not, but if there’s another assault of rain and horrific weather, I say embrace Halloween early this year, get to the cinema and enjoy this rollicking romp."
rotten,Not scary. Not funny. Just depressing.
rotten,One imagines the skirls of funereal bagpipes sounding throughout this deeply puzzling slab of unthreatening horror. This must be the end of something. Must it not?
fresh,It won’t put the frighteners on Barbie but Disney’s spooky family comedy should keep tills ringing over the school holidays.
rotten,"…with a game cast and no expense spared, it’s a fancy yet structurally mushy supernatural story for kids, one that makes little of the closer connection to the spirit world offered by the spooky New Orleans setting…"
rotten,The film feels like it can’t veer too far from the core younger audience it’s trying to entice. So you have a bigger version of the Disneyland ride with the same amount of staying power until you see another attraction.
fresh,"If you like the ride and any of these performers, you'll probably have an enjoyable time."
fresh,"It doesn't feel like a completely cohesive film, nor is it particularly successful at getting the emotions that it strives for, but it's serviceable."
rotten,"A sense of overfamiliarity is only one part of the film’s problem. A bigger one is that, despite able direction by Simien and the best efforts of a game cast, Haunted Mansion seems uncertain of its identity."
rotten,"If you’re hoping to get into the Halloween spirit two months ahead of time, this movie will not do that for you. It’s not very funny either and features a cast of extremely talented actors who look like they’re being held hostage for most of it."
fresh,"Its over-long runtime is enlivened only by the game cast, whose characters, everyone a fraud, find heroism by uniting against the malevolent Hat Box Ghost in a climactic battle-unto-death."
rotten,"Haunted Mansion is played for family-friendly laughs, with much cobwebbed Scooby-Doobery and character comedy..."
fresh,"A tour guide, a medium, a priest and a historian walk into a haunted mansion. There's no punchline, just an effective, spooky nostalgia trip for Disney lovers everywhere."
rotten,"Haunted Mansion is another disappointing adaptation of the famous Disney ride. LaKeith Stanfield, Tiffany Hadish and JLC do their best to keep it afloat but it eventually sinks into a convoluted mess that undercuts the inventive grief angle of the script."
rotten,"This is not a serious film, though it sometimes tries to be. It is harmless, mildly amusing fun, for the most part, but while it is getting somewhat better reviews than the 2003 film, it is still nowhere near as good as any of the Ghostbusters movies."
rotten,Jamie Lee Curtis follows her recent Oscar win by playing a disembodied head stuck in a crystal ball. Enough said.
rotten,"Like a ghost caught between two realms, the film suffers due to its inability to settle on a tone. The end result is a rather pedestrian ride that fails to raise anyone’s spirits."
rotten,"Everything was there to have a  comedy bonanza, but it just didn't happen."
fresh,"So while I liked the movie, it might be a drag for others, and they should’ve saved this for Halloween time, but hey, they probably just want it on Disney+ by then, which might be the more enjoyable way to see this movie."
fresh,"For a family seeking exciting entertainment, this Disney romp is a terrific choice."
fresh,2023’s “Haunted Mansion” is a flat and inoffensive continuation of the intellectual property but not a unique addition to the adaptation effort.
fresh,"Haunted Mansion rarely offers anything particularly insightful or enjoyable to older viewers, but it should work as a wonderful gateway horror for kids."
rotten,"...stuck in place, never quite achieving the bigger, more meaningful tone (director Justin) Simien seeks but can never quite get to materialize."
rotten,"Stanfield’s Ben has a nice arc, but most of these characters are underdeveloped. The plot is unmemorable and inconsistent."
rotten,"By the end of the chaotic mess, it just melts into a forgettable puddle of Disney stew as its one goal of giving relevance to the ride flushes down the toilet."
rotten,"Fans of the Magic Kingdom ride and kids with a taste for the macabre will likely find something to enjoy in Haunted Mansion, but for most everyone else it’s a passable but skippable trip to the other side."
rotten,The film grinds to a halt every time it deviates from the fun-and-games of the children’s horror movie and plunges into a five-minute monologue about dead spouses or regret or the ethics of the con men.
rotten,"It’s a valiant effort, but despite everyone working well within the confines of the material, and a few charming moments, it’s a movie that ultimately falls just a little flat."
rotten,"ou might have fun watching it, but it disperses into the ether fairly quickly, as evanescent as the 999 CG ghosts."
rotten,It's like the cast was just told to bicker and give sitcommy one-liners whenever the cameras were rolling.
rotten,An easy express ticket to defunctland.
rotten,Haunted Mansion comes so close to being good that it’s honestly infuriating that it comes up short. It’s frankly annoying.
rotten,"As a gateway introduction to the horror genre for a new generation, Haunted Mansion is worthy of some praise. But at the end of the day, these Disney remakes just feel like a cash grab. This is sadly no different."
fresh,"captur[es] the essence of the attraction with a blend of humor, heart, and just a touch of horror."
rotten,The specter of mediocrity shrouds the entire production.
rotten,It feels like a cash grab... I was bored. Bored. Bored. Bored.
fresh,"Like the Disney theme-park attraction upon which it’s based, at its best it’s entertaining in a quaint, late-’60s way, which makes it a pleasant summer surprise."
rotten,"Lakeith Stanfield showed up with a performance and Owen Wilson is having fun, but we are not as the rest of the cast goes through the motions of an overly-complicated plot with poorly designed set pieces and very few laughs."
rotten,"By all accounts this film captures the essence of the Disney ride as well as the characters. the film does an excellent job of introducing the characters. At best ,this is a matinee movie but I wouldn’t be mad at you if you waited to check it out at home."
fresh,"If you’re seeking a goofy movie about haunted mansions with floating ghosts, long lost tales of mean barons and cameras that can snap supernatural presences, this one still delivers."
rotten,"Haunted Mansion wants to appeal to all audiences with its generalized (often flat) comedy and satisfy the fans of a very unique theme park ride. In this case, you can’t have both."
fresh,"Justin Simien gets a good shot here to mix funny, scary, sweet and something for everyone, which is hard to do. It's a bumpy ride here and there but overall pretty fun which is all you could hope for from a movie based on an amusement park attraction."
fresh,Haunted Mansion is the ideal movie for a pre-Halloween in the summer season. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Haunted Mansion captures many of the motifs and visuals of the classic dark ride but fails to transcend those visuals into a spooktacular film that demands viewing every October.
rotten,Haunted Mansion is a forgettable film that seems to be made by a conglomerate and not one person. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,This somewhat fun yet mostly unnecessary reboot isn’t likely to provide the box office kick the House of Mouse needs.
rotten,"Haunted Mansion features an amazing cast, but feels way too long and dull, even with the little callbacks to the beloved Disney Parks ride."
rotten,"The film ended up leaving me with a ton of questions. Why am I watching this? Who is this film for? What random, vaguely eastern European accent is Jamie Lee Curtis going to attempt in her next scene? And why is Jared Leto?"
fresh,"A great cast who seem to having a lot of fun. The pacing is a little off at times, and it's not as laugh out loud funny as you'd want it to be, but I still had a good time with this film."
rotten,What we have here is a half-baked script replete with first-rate (fully baked?) special effects and performances from terrific actors trapped in a middling film the way their characters are trapped in the mansion.
rotten,"The latest attempt to cash in on one of the most popular rides in a few Disney theme parks does impress with special effects that actually resemble the ones playing smartly on the same-named attractions in Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, and Tokyo."
fresh,"Take two! Disney’s second attempt at adapting the theme park attraction into a movie is jam-packed with Easter Eggs Disneyland fans will enjoy, but the plot is a little lackluster."
fresh,"Some actors are silly while some keep it real, but all work overtime to give viewers a good time."
fresh,Disney's latest Haunted Mansion adaptation puts LaKeith Stanfield's formidable talents in an effects-driven adaptation of a theme park ride.
fresh,"Better than the 2003 version (but not as good as the Muppets one from 2021), this has some fun moments but wears thin with overblown VFX and jump scares."
rotten,There’s no wow factor here and it’s a movie that is scary in theory rather than in practice.
rotten,[LaKeith Stanfield] makes me want to like this movie more than I actually did.
rotten,"Despite a lively cast and a promising director, this Disney comedy barely has a pulse."
rotten,The new Haunted Mansion still feels unsatisfying because it's hard to tell which audience Disney was trying to reach.
fresh,"Haunted Mansion is a big, plastic theme park ride of packaged fun. It’s funny-scary, not scary-scary."
rotten,"""Haunted Mansion"" does very little to make the audience jump in fear or laugh in amusement. And much like the characters trying to leave the ghost house, the audience will have no escape for the two hours their ticket price commits them to."
fresh,"Haunted Mansion is typical Disney “creepy,” not exactly scary in the truest sense of the word, but still quite fun."
rotten,Haunted Mansion gets progressively zanier but not more enjoyable. It becomes harder and harder to remain invested in the story.
fresh,"Haunted Mansion is decently enjoyable. It works as an amusing cinematic tribute to the theme park attraction with a solid cast and some surprisingly genuine, emotional moments."
fresh,"Haunted Mansion isn’t a slog, but it’s rarely exciting."
rotten,“Haunted Mansion” is star-studded but shoddy at best.
rotten,"Disney’s need to appeal to the all-family market makes for a scary movie with no terror, too little wit, and almost no edge."
fresh,"It's a good-hearted movie, with an engaging cast."
fresh,"#HauntedMansion aims for more scares than laughs, but still embraces both for another family friendly Disney adventure. Its reluctance to push any boundaries is exactly why it ends up being only mildly haunting."
rotten,"It’s amazing that anything in Haunted Mansion works, even if most of it doesn’t."
rotten,Nice cast not given much today but make ironic quips in dull first half and react to CGI ghosts in the more energetic second half.
fresh,"I went into “Haunted Mansion” expecting a hot mess on par with Murphy’s movie. Instead, I found an engaging and sweet action comedy, one that’s not only very funny but also quite touching."
rotten,"It's frustrating, and confusing when a film with this star power manages to crash and burn as hard as Haunted Mansion does."
fresh,"Despite a few missteps here and there, Disney's The Haunted Mansion is a welcomed, entertaining addition to the summer blockbuster schedule while providing a healing lesson along the way. Yet, asking if grief paralyzes or empowers those left behind."
fresh,"Amidst the laughter and emotional moments, Haunted Mansion still makes time for some scares that catch you off guard."
rotten,"We think Director Simien and writer Dippold, could have filled the film with more imaginative comedy and wit instead of all the nostalgia from the Parks’ ride. This film is another Disney stumble. Haunted Mansion is ghostly, but also, alas, ghastly."
fresh,A delight packed with chills and heart.
rotten,Cannot be counted as anything more than a missed opportunity.
fresh,Haunted Mansion should be a new family favorite at Halloween.
rotten,"The ensemble cast is likable and amusing, but the movie seems like a missed opportunity."
rotten,It is becoming increasingly clear that Disney does not need artificial intelligence: its movies already seem robotic and soulless enough. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"None of it proves engaging, regardless of the fine-looking production and solid cast."
rotten,"This should have been an easy win, but everything falls apart and never gets put back together again."
rotten,A major disappointment on every level.
rotten,A slushy old mess...
rotten,It went downhill so fast.
rotten,A movie that left me as cold as the snowman's grin.
rotten,The Snowman isn't just a disaster that makes less than two hours feel like an eternity; it's the worst movie of 2017.
rotten,"The Snowman is dull, uninspired, lifeless, sluggish and boring. I think that about covers it, let me just check my thesaurus a minute, here...oh, yes, meandering and tedious."
rotten,"It's not a terrible film, but for most of this impressive cast and crew, it's likely the worst things on their filmography."
rotten,What a mess.
rotten,I cannot remember seeing a studio film that was this messy.
rotten,"If only a better film could have been made from the engaging novel. If only, if only."
rotten,"Deeply idiosyncratic characters and potent images can be found here and there, but The Snowman never seems under his control..."
rotten,"I wish I was exaggerating with this review, but The Snowman is genuinely one of the worst cinematic experiences I've had. It's laughable, yet is trying to be the furthest thing from a comedy."
rotten,"The final takeaway is nothing more than a feeling of dread towards the egregious and bountiful missed opportunities. [February 1, 2018]"
rotten,"The treatment of the killer is difficult to assimilate, being sometimes very intelligent, but strangely neglected in other moments. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The only positive that the film has to offer is its picturesque cinematography of Norway which, thankfully, manages to distract the audience enough so they don't leap out of their seat out of frustration and walk out of the theatre."
rotten,A complete misfire.
rotten,A muddled thriller that appears to have been edited by a blind man wildly swinging an ax.
rotten,"Might be one of the most painfully misguided, poorly conceived mainstream films of its caliber in recent memory."
rotten,"This is, for worse and only worse, the slipperiest slog of a crime thriller you'll attempt to grasp in 2017 - and that's only one out of infinity problems."
rotten,"The Snowman is competently shot, but the plot makes zero sense. This tense thriller is lacking both tension and thrills."
rotten,Obviously missing parts that are vital to the comprehension of this messy story.
rotten,The real problem seems to be a laughably bad script.
rotten,One of the worst thrillers of all time. An ugly mess that clearly no one saw before releasing. [Full review in Spanish].
rotten,"A major misfire for all involved and a huge blotch on some immensely respectable CVs, The Snowman ends its life as a puddle of plot-holes and wasted talent."
rotten,It's a movie that's literally missing 15 percent of the story.
rotten,The Snowman is a perfect storm of badness.
rotten,"The truly gob smacking thing about The Snowman is how fundamentally incompetent it feels, considering the caliber of filmmakers who brought this lumbering beast to life."
rotten,"Seeing the final result of this film, everyone involved in the film is in desperate need of an ice kicking."
rotten,"It rides too much on the coattails of previous crime films, including the works of David Fincher, and the mystery becomes increasingly obvious, silly and unthreatening, despite the mean-spirited twists away from the book."
rotten,A nonsensical movie less famous than its own meme.
rotten,"A frigid disaster of a serial killer thriller, The Snowman does just about everything wrong."""
rotten,"You'll go in looking for an ice-cold, grisly chiller. Instead you'll be served the equivalent of a tepid cup of Bovril - and I really hate Bovril."
rotten,"While The Snowman seems to have a few words about broken families, its more obvious lesson is don't make a movie while alcohol is in the system."
rotten,The Snowman fails to deliver on its promise of a riveting serial killer thriller.
rotten,"With everything going on, this could have been a truly great movie... missed potential is so frustrating."
rotten,"There are many sequences that left me going, ""Wait, what?"""
rotten,"The Snowman has some extraordinary visuals that make a strong impression, but that's more than can be said for its narrative or its people."
rotten,This film may well be the last gasp of Scandi-noir for the international market...this phase of Nordic has gone from original to dutiful emulation to dreary self-parody.
fresh,"The gruesome and graphic crime thriller should be a treat for those who love the genre (like me), but is let down because both the characters and story are muddled."
rotten,Dreadfully difficult to sit through and ultra confusing.
rotten,"This movie is a shoddy, messy wreck. Tonally speaking, it's off, the editing is terrible."
rotten,The Snowman is a mess - but it is at least a fascinating one.
rotten,The Snowman has completely and utterly squandered any ounce of potential it may have initially possessed...
rotten,"Choppy, incoherent and dull, The Snowman is one of the worst films of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Bad storytelling, bad monikers, bland characterisation, by-the-numbers backstory, barely interesting procedural drama: there's an avalanche brewing in The Snowman, and it's of the generic and cliched kind."
rotten,Even Fassbender's typically intense and well-schooled performance can't elevate this muddled mess from the mundane.
rotten,"The ensuing mystery becomes less about the one in the story, and more about how all this talent could be so squandered."
rotten,"Unrelenting, but in the most trivial, unimaginative way."
rotten,"The mystery develops in directions that aren't remotely interesting, leaving the entire movie feeling flat. At least it's beautifully photographed in stunning Norwegian scenery."
rotten,"What to make of a film that introduces Chlo Sevigny happily beheading chickens with an axe, has her beheaded herself by the killer, then immediately produces a twin sister to deliver a single item of exposition before never being seen again?"
rotten,"The Snowman is a pratfall by the prima ballerina of the Bolshoi. It's not without interest, and it deserves every ounce of the opprobrium it's attracted."
rotten,Not even Michael Fassbender can save this tedious excuse for a thriller.
rotten,"[The Snowman] is two hours of uninterrupted, snow-caked boredom."
rotten,"It's a story told in patchwork, and most of those involved deserve better."
rotten,The Snowman's just not worth sticking your neck out for.
rotten,"... the movie itself is an inept misfire - the kind of entrancing train wreck that makes you long for a behind-the-scene tell-all to explain what, exactly, went so wrong."
rotten,How did a delicious Scandinavian noir novel go so spectacularly wrong on screen?
fresh,"Even in its imperfections, ""The Snowman"" is unusual, fascinating, and warranting of closer consideration, a layered thriller with aesthetic beauty to spare and forlorn wisdom into both the mysteries and universalities of the human condition."
rotten,The Snowman is a slog.
rotten,It's a melting mess of a thriller.
rotten,"Under even the most cursory scrutiny, The Snowman simply melts."
rotten,What we unequivocally have here is the Emoji Movie of serial-killer thrillers.
rotten,"The brain freeze that is The Snowman should destroy any hopes of a franchise and that, considering how good the Nesb series is, ranks as a damn shame."
rotten,"When the director of a twisted, turgid murder mystery admits something went wrong, it's worth noting..."
rotten,"Overstuffed and clumsy, nothing makes sense."
rotten,"A potboiler story that should have been an easy hit but is instead a plodding, emotionless exercise to be cast down the memory hole (harry or otherwise)."

rotten,"I liked The Snowman just fine-it's scary, and all the casual detective knitwear looked cozy-but I watch a lot of murder mysteries and have a high tolerance for even the category's most mediocre entries. This is certainly one of them."
rotten,"In a lot of ways, ""The Snowman"" is like IKEA made a movie; and then they asked you to assemble it without any instructions."
rotten,There's a similar lack of character development when it comes to the main players in the current day setting.
rotten,Not a single scene works as anything more than a total waste of good film.
rotten,"With such talent in front of and behind the camera, it's a shame that The Snowman's narrative and structural problems weren't properly adjusted before its release."
rotten,'The Snowman' made me laugh when it probably shouldn't have.
rotten,"Michael Fassbender as a detective named ""Harry Hole."" A serial killer who puts snowman heads on their victims. How the hell did this get made?"
rotten,"With a perplexing tale and some very odd creative choices, it's so easy to laugh at The Snowman, but this kind of tale shouldn't inspire laughter."
rotten,"The problem isn't excess of ambition or a pointed performance, it's simply a failure to master the basics. The storytelling is disjointed and ineffective, the mood mostly lackadaisical."
rotten,"In this soul-deadening freeze, who wouldn't seek solace in a bottle? Or in the physical warmth of a lover's arms? Or in mass murder?"
rotten,The storytelling in The Snowman is the cinematic equivalent of listening to somebody trying to remember the plot of a paperback they read in an airport 10 years ago.
rotten,"None of it is supposed to be funny, despite leading-man Fassbender's character name, Harry Hole, and an ending that actually leaves room for a sequel. Ha!"
rotten,"The movie is disjointed and sometimes hard to follow, with scenes that start or end abruptly, narrative threads that go nowhere and poorly inserted flashbacks."
rotten,"One of the most shockingly awful wastes of talent imaginable, this adaptation of Jo Nesbo's thriller is mostly incoherent and, just when it starts to make sense, it is hijacked by a series of laughably bad clichs."
rotten,"Do you want a thrill-less ""Snowmaaaaaan""? This movie seems to last all dayyyyy. Rare are mainstream screw-ups like this anymore. Profoundly poor. What's this story trying to sayyyyy? An odious, offensive objet d'art with a depressing Val Kilmer turn."
rotten,The Snowman is as incompetently made as any studio movie in recent memory.
rotten,"Everything about ""The Snowman"" is off-kilter, as if those behind the camera wanted to simply rush through the filming and get it into theaters as soon as possible."
rotten,"The overall outcome of ""The Snowman"" is definitely disappointing. Parts of this movie are gripping --- and even terrifying --- but the script and Alfredson's direction never capitalize on those moments."
rotten,"I found the plot a bit confusing with its myriad of characters, then and now."
rotten,What's especially alarming is how the film squanders talent on both sides of the camera.

rotten,"The Snowman, despite the majestic location cinematography, falls rather flat."
rotten,It's as if everybody involved in The Snowman knew from the start that this wasn't going to work and agreed to put forth the minimum effort required to get it over with.
rotten,"It's a disappointment too that Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, who found such rhythm and bite in recent outings such as ""Let the Right One In"" (2008) and ""Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy"" (2011), seems so hobbled here."
rotten,How did such an amazing roaster of talented people go so horribly awry?
rotten,The Snowman goes wrong in almost every way a movie can.
rotten,The movie plays as if he threw in the towel in the editing room. It's a stiff.
rotten,...makes no sense whatsoever...Fassbender sleepwalks through the role...the biggest mystery in the movie is what is Val Kilmer doing there and what is he mumbling?
rotten,"It's bad. A bit of a full-on Nesbner, in fact."
rotten,"It's a pity, because there's some squirmy vitality in the hothouse premise."
rotten,"When a film's reputation behind the scenes is more interesting than the finished result, that's not a great sign."
rotten,"The author has a great reputation, and I'd hate to think anything as dull and poorly plotted as this trudge through yellow snow in search of a serial killer contributed to that."
rotten,That look isn't enough to overcome a sluggish pace and increasingly implausible plot. Frozen red herrings are still red herrings.
rotten,All these sinister snowmen-are we in some sort of dark Pillsbury universe here?
rotten,Several great actors wasted. A boring villain. Too many characters in an equally boring plot. This one melts as quickly as a snowman in a heatwave.
rotten,A story that might have been confusing even if the movie didn't appear to have been edited with an immersion blender.
rotten,"Completely, atrociously, perhaps even impressively, stupid."
rotten,"Playground snowball fights have more suspense and intrigue than ""The Snowman,"" the most puzzlingly bad movie of the year."
rotten,"This is a muddled adaptation of Jo Nesb's best-selling thriller. I'm hard pressed to remember another police procedural that was so dull, or so encumbered in trying to tell its story."
rotten,"It all makes sense if one ignores all of the diversions, but doing that makes The Snowman considerably shorter. That's probably a good thing."
rotten,"Disjointed, clichd and not nearly as tense or thrilling as the trailer implies, The Snowman is a lesson in squandered potential."
rotten,The Snowman ruined both snow and Michael Fassbender for me.
rotten,"""The Snowman"" is ugly and nasty, but that's not the worst of it. The worst is that it's boring and makes no sense."
rotten,The biggest mystery within Tomas Alfredson's The Snowman concerns its own creation.
rotten,"While there are elements of a riveting Swedish Noir thriller here, The Snowman proves to be more of a pulpy mess than a chilling crime tale."
rotten,"Somehow, someway, in the summer of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” which renewed the hope of film fans that quality cinema was fighting back, there’s now “My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3.” Alas, it’s the Trojan Horse of movies."
rotten,"This movie is as successful as the sitcom spinoff they tried in the early 2000s, which means it was unsuccessful. I can’t really suggest going to see this; even with a few fun performances, it just wasn’t enough to not feel like a complete waste of time."
rotten,"It's very well-intentioned, but it doesn't hit the notes and ends up feeling like a medley of greatest hits from the first two."
fresh,Overall the vibe is feelgood - Mamma Mia! minus the Abba songs - helped along by jokes as cheesy as barrel-aged feta.
rotten,The only thing in MBFGW3 that’s older than the jokes is the Parthenon.
rotten,"Much, in fact, is up in the air. The only grounded member of the clan is Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) who has a great one-liner when you need it the most. She finds laughs even when Nia Vardalos wasn’t counting on them."
rotten,One trip to the well too many.
rotten,All you’re trying to do is recapture the magic and sadly My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 just can’t find it.
rotten,"A satire can be both beautiful and witty at the same time, but it takes more than people screaming or bumping their heads to help the humor part land."
rotten,"Writer/director/star Nia Vardalos should have given My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 the title My Big Fat Pathetic Excuse for a Movie Sequel. This dull, unfunny film drags down to embarrassing levels of stale jokes that would be rejected by amateur comedians."
fresh,"Credit cinematographer Barry Peterson for making this an enticing Aegean travelogue but - as a feature film - it's a bit of a bittersweet disappointment, relying on cliche-riddled ethnic humor to sustain its lovably familiar, colorful characters."
fresh,I might be swimming against the tide here: I enjoyed this movie a lot.
rotten,"I was physically uncomfortable the whole way through, because this is just a fever dream of bad choices."
rotten,"While the latest effort is slightly better than the previous film, its still pretty miserable -- a pale imitation of the original that plays more like a travel ad for Greece than an actual feature film."
rotten,"Desperate to wring every last bit of charm and goodwill from its stale premise, this third installment in the 20-year-old comedy franchise is more content to rehash than refresh."
rotten,As much presence and charisma as an olive oil commercial.
fresh,"In spite of its third-film shortcomings, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 has some genuine laughs and a healthy dose of heart."
rotten,"There’s not an original idea in Ms Vardalos’ pretty head here, and it’s just a shame that in is her directorial debut she didn’t even have the courage to jettison the light comedy for the social commentary on the tip of her tongue."
rotten,"No matter whether fleshing out a sappy subplot about young love or firing off a silly sight gag about how not to be a holiday-maker in Corfu, every single joke comes as flat, forced and futile."
rotten,"No amount of Windex can fix My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, which is yet another disappointing sequel in a series that has truly worn out its welcome."
rotten,"[The franchise] makes it to Greece ... but if ""better than a trip to Illinois"" is all we can say about My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3, then maybe it's time to say goodbye to Toula, Voula and the rest of the cousins."
fresh,"The writing is uncomplicated, creating warm and silly situations without much set-up or pay-off, but it's easy to watch and sometimes even funny."
fresh,"For a second sequel to a hit movie that had a specific moment more than 20 years ago, starring a cast that mostly doesn’t have much else to do these days, it's surprisingly winning and charming."
fresh,"Watching these movies is like hanging out with her character in a crowded home full of her kooky relatives. They’re warm, they’re welcoming, and they’re very Greek. And as far as they’re concerned, when you’re hanging with them, you are too."
rotten,We’re still left with cute but thinly drawn characters with little personality beyond signature quirks.
rotten,"If you like movies involving animals running through houses, tourists inadvertently getting day drunk... this will be 90 minutes of bliss. For everyone else, it’s like watching an American-Greek family do a particularly awful episode of Travel Guides."
fresh,"It's not suspenseful and it's only occasionally funny, but I enjoyed it anyway; it's about familial and generational issues that connect with most of us, especially as we get older."
rotten,It’s a rom-com both com-less and rom-less.
rotten,"Personally, this series has never done much for me, and that’s the case with this third effort, too. As great as the ensemble might be, Vardalos aims much too low."
rotten,"Of all of the disappointments in Vardalos’ clumsy directing, the worst may be how she rushes through the travelogue portions of the movie, so that the audience can’t enjoy the sights."
fresh,"Sure, the film recycles the franchise’s familiar jokes about vegetarianism, everyone being cousins, and pulling your neck tight for photos. But each one made me feel warmer than the one before, like eating through the layers of an amazing spanakopita."
rotten,"Another sloppy helping of migrant family cliches, served up with the same loving forcefulness as grandma’s moussaka."
rotten,"However, what’s really missing in the film, which was both written and directed by Vardalos, is…Nia Vardalos."
rotten,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 should have been a breezy postcard. Instead, no amount of sequences filmed during golden hour can distract from the story’s clunkiness."
rotten,Time to bury this franchise.
fresh,"The laughs are fewer than before, but the story’s always been less about ha-ha than “awww” moments, which this one has aplenty."
fresh,"Sometimes there are too mushy moments, cartoonish characters and comedic excess, but Vardalos has done a pretty good job crafting her passion project. This love letter to Greece is more like the original film and worth a big Opaa!"
rotten,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is so bad, if you found yourself in a locked room and it was the only movie you could watch, the blank screen would be far more entertaining."
rotten,"The increasingly separate paths of each character drastically affect the respective cast performances, causing most of them to dawdle with no real purpose throughout the film, only to see them clumsily clamour together for the collective finish."
rotten,It's like the tenth SNL skit for a beloved character whose punchline has finally curdled into cringe.
fresh,"It’s the best-crafted film in the series, thanks in part to Vardalos taking the reins as director."
rotten,A better title may have been My Big Fat Greek Vacation Commercial.
rotten,"The script functions like a recipe for its own opening shot of baklava; flattened and bland, Toula exists only to constrain the nuts."
fresh,"It is full of so much joy, and so much heart, celebrating family, culture, and love, while also emphasizing that even the most ancient of civilizations aren't completely trapped in the past, especially if the new generation has anything to say about it."
fresh,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3"" is sweet enough to enjoy and harmless enough not to offend, but it's a bit of a tragedy it isn't anything else."
rotten,"The film itself is a hodgepodge of scenes with little humor or emotion, making it a waste of 90 minutes for anyone unlucky enough to sit through it."
rotten,"Vardalos' script recycles lots of the first movie's same cultural jokes, which fall flat two decades later."
rotten,"The scenery [Greece] is fantastic, but the movie is not. The plot is contrived, bland, and boring, and, most importantly, there are almost no laughs in this comedy."
rotten,A torrent of lame jokes interrupted by travelogue shots of Greece... The film ultimately only succeeds in highlighting Vardalos’ seemingly gargantuan ego and offers viewers a big fat Greek funeral for the joy the series once possessed.
rotten,"Overall, this sequel is more enjoyable than the second one, but the film is merely too crowded, so it’s difficult to enjoy it more than the original."
fresh,"The negative reviews are missing the point. Vardalos is looking at a Greek family w/o their father anchor, and giving space to what comes next. Yes, it was clunky in parts but the heart was there, and the humor was much closer to the classic first film."
rotten,"This is not a very good movie. But just as it is hard to be a grouch at a wedding, even with this movie’s shortcomings, I did not have a bad time watching it – thanks mostly to the charming cast and the beautiful Greek countryside the film is set against."
rotten,An extended commercial for Greek vacations and the idealized immigrant family.
rotten,"Pretty scenery. Plenty of nicely styled pictures of food, and --- well ... I think I'm out of reasons why we have a My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3."
rotten,'My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3' is the most unnecessary movie of the year. Who asked for this? Who really wanted this?
rotten,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 has many endearing and amusing scenes, but it fails to recapture the magic of the original movie."
rotten,"Audience goodwill is the only thing this third take on Greek family bonding has going for it as writer-director star-Nia Vardalos keeps pushing the same brand of ethnic humor. And I mean, really pushing, another reason the movie falls so painfully flat."
rotten,"The most egregious fault of MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING 3 is its lack of humorous content. There is a great deal of silliness, but not much in the way of entertaining hilarity."
rotten,MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING 3 is teeming with one-liners and sight gags that simply fall flat. This sequel to a sequel is just a shell of what the original fun movie was in 2002.
fresh,The humor is sitcom level but it's light and fun and enjoyable
rotten,“My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3” is one wedding invitation you won’t want to accept.
rotten,"This picture's a corpse still being shock-paddled and CPR-pounded on the operating table. Call the code, Nia"
fresh,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is a pleasant move that emphasizes the importance of family and love, but without much story depth."
rotten,"The film is determined to be a good time for all, but whatever plucky magic was offered in the first feature is long gone at this point."
rotten,"There are some intimate moments that, if played with even a hint of restraint, could have pulled at the heartstrings. Instead, we get souvlaki jokes, banal schmaltziness and choppily edited tourism bureau style footage."
fresh,"For those who have enjoyed the previous films in the franchise and enjoy spending time with these characters, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is sure to be an enjoyable viewing experience."
rotten,"A genial clutter...less a finished movie than an inchoate idea for one,...like a ninety-minute montage of bits and pieces of plot that are resolved without ever having been developed.  The scenery and cinematography are pretty, though."
rotten,"The first sequel, in 2016, was uncalled for, and this one is a similarly cheerful but ham-fisted exercise in weak sitcom humour."
rotten,"Heaping helpings of romance, food, familial squabbling and broad comedy are on the menu as Toula and the gang set out for a reunion in the home country. A sunny, unambitious crowd-pleaser."
rotten,"Twenty-one years after audiences initially said “I do,” My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 compels us to start divorce proceedings."
fresh,"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is simply meant to be escapist entertainment. On that front, it succeeds more than it fails..."
fresh,"As action-packed as a holiday nap on a hot afternoon, this is a must-see only for Portakalos die-hards."
fresh,"While the sentiment is genuine & the story is filled with a few fun & heartfelt moments, there are too many subplots that don’t converge cohesively."
fresh,"This latest installation in the “Big Fat Greek” franchise is colorful and celebratory, eager to entertain and wears its heart on its sleeve. There’s something to be said for that."
rotten,"It’s amiable enough, but devoid of real surprise or jeopardy and full of hokey guff about accepting people for who they really are."
rotten,"It’s Mamma Mia!, minus ABBA. Don’t say you weren’t warned."
rotten,This awkward threequel is one wedding you’ll wish you didn’t RSVP to.
rotten,"Director Vardalos, the keeper of her half-billion-dollar franchise, mistakes antsiness for energy, cutting constantly, messing up the rhythms."
rotten,"It's a genial, somewhat bland comedy that plays more like a collection of choppy bits than a movie with a beginning, middle and end."
rotten,"In keeping with My Big Fat Greek Wedding tradition, if a joke is mildly amusing, it will be repeated until it makes you want to jam your head into the cup holder attached to your stadium seat."
rotten,"The whole thing just feels like watching someone’s extremely well-produced vacation video, in which people say things like “We are now going to dance a traditional Greek dance” and goats randomly appear."
rotten,"Perhaps unsurprisingly, Greece steals the show while the rest of the cast struggles to get out of holiday mode."
rotten,"If “My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2” felt like a pale imitation of the buoyant original, “My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3” feels sorta like a pale imitation of that pale imitation."
rotten,"""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3"" serves only to trot out the past with increasingly diminishing returns. It's a Greek tragedy."
fresh,"If you wish to be transported for an hour and a half to a happy smiley world, where people dance in the streets and problems can be easily resolved then this movie won’t be all Greek to you."
rotten,"This tasty brew felt like it was on the turn when writer-star Nia Vardalos reheated it for a 2016 sequel. Now, it feels as stale as last week’s moussaka."
rotten,"“My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3” goes for the cheap laughs and the tacky attempts at pulling heartstrings. Hopefully, this is the end of the “My Big Fat Greek” anything, weddings be damned."
fresh,"If you enjoyed spending time with Nia Vardalos’ Toula and the rest of her extended clan, you’ll probably have a good time again, even if the characters and jokes are wearing thin with repetition."
fresh,"Even at the third time of asking, Vardalos has lost none of her talent for bringing an authentic and heartfelt depiction of the Greek experience to the big screen, ably supported by a committed cast."
rotten,Non-threatening to the point of banality.
fresh,"For devotees of the franchise, Nia Vardalos's film will be a surprisingly emotional trip home."
rotten,"If keeping faithful content is the objective here, why not just remake the 2002 movie over and over again, rather than pretending to attempt something new?"
fresh,"A disposable, super-light, sufficiently pleasant time killer that will clearly please fans."
rotten,None of My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 has a shred of naturality about it in the same way the original film did.
fresh,"The Notebook is one of those movies that is so sad, you could break out into tears just thinking about it."
fresh,A tearjerker? It'll make you cry but it's not manipulative. A chick flick? It's just an inspiring love story that will touch your heart and make you believe true love can last a lifetime and conquer all. Isn't that what we all want?
fresh,"There is always cinema room for the unabashed tearjerker, & THE N delivers on that ""note."" Any film that has Gena Rowlands in it will at least shine when she is on the screen & this was no exception. David Thornton with a handlebar mustache ... exquisite!"
fresh,"Though torn between two storylines, one of which vastly outshines the other, ""The Notebook"" is still an impressive production."
fresh,"Intelligently adapted and written by Jan Sardi, this is the tear-jerker of the summer. A chick flick? Yes. Classic Hollywood romance? Yes. Will it touch your heart? Without a doubt..."
rotten,James Garner and Gena Rowlands lend the story a graceful gravity that perhaps the rest of the film's more simplistic romanticism doesn't deserve.
rotten,Never quite escapes the been-there-done-that feeling of Hollywood romantic cliché with sunny photography and perfectly tailored costumes to boot.
fresh,Frank Capra would be proud of the way Nick Cassavetes pulls at the heart strings... Have tissues at the ready.
rotten,The Notebook is a ghastly piece of oldie slush which is tediously orchestrated by Nick Cassavetes.
rotten,"The Notebook is the kind of syrupy, heightened melodrama more likely to be found in the pages of a Mills & Boon paperback than on the silver screen."
rotten,"In a romance where paradise is a duck-filled pond, it helps to be mild-mannered."
rotten,Dentistry in the Renaissance could not have been more painful than watching this.
fresh,The Notebook is premium romantic schlock and confirms director Nick Cassavetes (Rowlands' son) as a specialist in the genre after John Q in 2002.
fresh,"Two good, young performers and a couple of not-too-shabby older ones not only make The Notebook worth watching but distinguish the film as one of the year's more pleasant surprises."
fresh,The Notebook is a thoroughly old-fashioned romantic melodrama awash with misty-eyed sentiment as it charts the obstacles placed in the path of two young lovers from opposite sides of the social divide.
fresh,"A shameless tear-jerker and as corny as they come, this retro romantic drama skilfully pushes all the right emotional buttons."
fresh,"A honey-dipped love story with a surprisingly tart aftertaste, The Notebook is a better-than-you'd-expect adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's bestselling novel of the same name."
fresh,"A story about true love that makes you cry, the kind you don't forget. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"What saves Notebook, or at least lifts it above itself, are the hints of hard-won grit that both Gosling and Garner inject into their characters."
fresh,"Sure, The Notebook's story of first love tends toward the histrionic and self-important. But if that's case, perhaps Cassavetes, like Shakespeare, simply knows how to give the people what they want."
fresh,"It's no secret that Mr. Gosling is one of our most gifted young actors. Still, this is his first romantic lead, and he's superb -- interesting in his inwardness, endearing in his demonstrativeness."
fresh,"If you ever want to see a flawless example of a movie which is redeemed from mediocrity solely through the cast, there is hardly a better one than this."
rotten,"Bland and sentimental, The Notebook is old-fashioned filmmaking aimed at an old-fashioned audience. Kleenex essential."
rotten,"The connection between the two narratives is supposed to be a big, heartbreaking surprise, though I figured it out well in advance and spent the interim unfavorably comparing this greatest-generation hanky wringer to the British drama Iris."
fresh,"Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams spark cinematically everlasting magic in a romance that's no tawdry Harlequin hay-roll. ""The Notebook"" excels most when contemplating love's obligations and responsibilities, that unique balance of fire and calm."
fresh,A very engrossing and entertaining sudsy romance with top notch performances.
fresh,"for someone who loves these sorts of stories, it would be a fantastic movie"
fresh,I prepared myself for a tearjerker; what I didn't prepare for was an outright gusher.
fresh,...one of contemporary cinema's most compelling and flat-out indelible love stories.
fresh,"A potently rich story about the power of love, The Notebook is heartbreakingly beautiful and achingly real."
fresh,Ssomehow Cassavetes pulls it off -- thanks mainly to sensitive performances and pretty Hallmark-card cinematography by Robert Fraisse.
fresh,A sentimental film filled with flashbacks and clichés.
fresh,"A thoughtful, emotionally rich film in which we see that great love, like deep faith, is forged on doubt, trials, and hardships. Only then does it deliver its deepest rewards."
fresh,"Amid the sticky-sweet swamp of Jeremy Leven's script, Rowlands and Garner emerge spotless and beatific, lending a near-miraculous credibility to their scenes together."
fresh,I cannot believe I'm about to recommend a movie as clogged with melodramatic treacle as Nick Cassavetes' adaptation of The Notebook.
rotten,... one gets the sense that director Nick Cassevetes and writer Jan Sardi would spray the audience with teargas if they could.
rotten,"The Notebook is a weepie of the most artificial and insistent variety, the kind that holds viewers hostage and expects them to pay in body fluids. Will it jerk your tears? Maybe. Or maybe you'll just feel jerked around."
fresh,Um romance sensível e emocionante que leva o espectador a se importar com o destino de seus tocantes personagens.
rotten,Whether someone can enjoy The Notebook or not depends much of the mood in which the viewers find themselves.
rotten,"It's an interesting piece of counter programming on New Line's part, the only question is why didn't it go direct to cable?"
rotten,"Two parts idiotic romance, one part offensive melodrama."
fresh,A fine tale that will leave romantics everywhere misty eyed.
rotten,*There's nothing about The Notebook that isn't either lazy or dismissive of its audience.
rotten,A mawkish romance; one of the year's 10 worst
rotten,"The Notebook doesn't give you a postcard-pretty plot, like most romance flicks. Instead, it shows you the fights, bickering and disagreements that go on in a relationship. And how true love ultimately triumphs that."
fresh,"I see several films a week, year after year. Once in a great while I see one that I know will stay with me for the rest of my life. That's The Notebook."
rotten,One of those films you want to like and want to keep watching because it looks so pretty.
fresh,"A sweet, mortal-boy-meets-mortal-girl swoonfest, Nick Cassavetes's drama is the gooey double cone that slides down real good."
fresh,The real two joys of the film are Garner and Rowlands.
rotten,It's a vat of sticky sentimentality that demands pretty strenuous swimming.
rotten,The photography is lush but the main plot line of the rich girl and the country boy is just too familiar and cliched.
fresh,"How rare to see a film that says there is still a value system out there, that being thoughtful and caring is not uncool."
rotten,[A] glorified simplification of adolescence and an excrutiatingly precious recreation of WWII-era Americana.
fresh,"Its first 15-20 minutes are awful, but the film eventually emerges as a credible and even genuinely heartrending tearjerker."
rotten,"If trailers to Cassavetes' unashamed tearjerker seem interminable, try sitting through the contrived sentimental sap of the two-hour-plus film."
fresh,"Like a summer wedding, you attend and root and try your best not to snicker."
rotten,"Whenever the kids are on the screen, you keep wishing that they'd send the grown-ups back in."
rotten,"If you're looking for an adventure in summer camp, pencil in The Notebook."
fresh,"Well-done, well-acted schmaltz, a beautifully shot melodrama that overcomes its contrivances by striking just the right romantic tone."
fresh,"Gosling and McAdams sizzle with romantic chemistry, and they give standout performances."
fresh,What a glorious weepie The Notebook might have been if they'd just found a way to get rid of the damned notebook.
fresh,"Despite the occasional flaw, The Notebook is a well acted, beautifully photographed 1940s romance."
rotten,"From one climax to the next, the filmmakers rarely jeopardize the chances for a heartwarming and miraculous outcome."
rotten,"Ladies, leave the guys at home for this one."
fresh,"An uncomplicated, nicely shot tale that ticks all the right boxes for those after a good old-fashioned weepy."
fresh,"Despite the obvious clichés and predictable story lines, the movie manages to work because the actors made it work."
rotten,More like a carefully packaged commercial for America in the 1940s than a film about it.
rotten,"This film tries to evoke the 1940s but never quite finds the right tone, coming off instead like a big costume party."
rotten,"The movie not only approaches a level of shamelessness you have to see to disbelieve, it does it in a manner that's both inept and crass."
rotten,Achieves its purpose of emotional manipulation that will likely pay off handsomely at the boxoffice with all those folks who are only too happy to soak a few hankies.
fresh,A magnificently effective tearjerker.
fresh,This is an ideal date movie with some touching romantic stuff going down.
rotten,Watching the young lovers rowing on a duck-filled pond is about as exciting as this film ever gets.
fresh,One of the best love stories of recent years.
rotten,"Melodramatic mush...there's not much worth jotting down in Notebook that would invite lovers of all ages to revel in the sugar-tooth cliches of this drowsy, drippy drama"
fresh,It's important that I mention travel-size tissue packs.
fresh,"Sap is sap, but The Notebook's cast renders the dual love stories worthy of our affections"
fresh,"Even though we've seen these types of characters before, this group of actors makes them feel interesting and unique."
fresh,"Real-life love stories rarely work out quite so faultlessly, but for two hours it's nice to believe that they could."
fresh,"May be one hundred percent sap, but its spirit is anything but cloying, thanks to persuasive performances, most notably from Rachel McAdams."
rotten,This is a movie that isn't ashamed to wring each teardrop by any means necessary.
rotten,"Cassavetes' film is unusually well-acted and lovely to look at, but his wholehearted embrace of saccharine melodrama and tendency to let scenes ramble on long after their point has been expressed makes for some slow going."
fresh,"Our resistance is broken down, and the hankies are out."
rotten,"It's all sweet and gooey and absolutely predictable, in a bland TV-movie sort of way, with an ending so shameless it should come with an apology."
fresh,An old-fashioned and occasionally schmaltzy movie that delivers an emotional wallop sure to elicit tears from all but those with truly intractable hearts.
fresh,"The movie may be highly disposable, but the individual scenes of Gosling and McAdams just acting and just connecting are wonderful to watch."
rotten,"Shamelessly manipulative, utterly predictable and often laughably maudlin, this earnest tearjerker is also strangely watchable, like one of those afternoon soap operas that hook you, even though you know it's a glossy piece of hokum."
fresh,"Sincere, charming performers can overcome a lot, and [McAdams's and Gosling's] rapport cuts through much of the schmaltz, er, special moments of light."
fresh,There are weepies and weepies. And The Notebook may be the most effective one in nearly a decade -- since the film version of The Bridges of Madison County.
rotten,"The movie's dragged down by a droopy male lead, narration that would sound saccharine in a bad airport paperback, music the filmmakers lean on like a car horn and an insulting, inconsistent approach to elderly dementia."
fresh,"Much like an awkward but well-intentioned suitor, the movie inspires affection despite its overwrought script and occasionally clunky staging."
fresh,Well worth the risk of diabetic shock for the sake of superb acting that transcends its teary milieu.
rotten,Two hours of the worst sort of sentimental sap.
fresh,"In addition to being a tearjerker, The Notebook is an entertaining, human story that explores relationships from many angles."
rotten,Men hardly need to be warned that this is basically just Titanic without anything cool like a ship sinking or Kate Winslet posing for art.
rotten,"For those of even a moderately cynical bent, The Notebook is likely to induce apoplectic choking."
fresh,To fight it is foolish. It's much easier and far more rewarding just to give in and let Cassavetes and his cast play you like a harp.
rotten,"A maudlin sap-fest that overwhelms the fine cast and reduces many of their scenes to sheer manipulation, not illuminating drama."
rotten,"Meant to be a romantic weepy, and you will shed tears -- but only from the consistent and exhausting effort of trying to control your gag reflex."
fresh,Cheesy? Totally. But totally moving as well.
fresh,"A small, smart film filled with heart."
rotten,"It just feels so routine, and director Nick Cassavetes' pacing is so sluggish the film feels longer than it is."
rotten,"Cue the sensitive piano. Make the settings picturesque. Add a corny narration, and let the love boat sail."
rotten,One of the shallowest movies in recent memory.
fresh,"Now here is a story that could have been a tearjerker, but -- no, wait, it is a tearjerker, it's just that it's a good one."
rotten,"Considering the sunny, relatively pleasurable romantic business that precedes it, the elderly stuff seems dark, morbid, and forced upon us."
rotten,"Tells a tale we've heard hundreds of times before, yet pretends it will surprise us. It doesn't."
fresh,"Go ahead and call me whatever name you want. I'm still recommending the weepy and unabashedly square romantic drama ""The Notebook."""
rotten,"Precisely the horrible kind of heart-wrenching pabulum that's been milked damn near dry by countless other so-called ""timeless"" cinematic tales of passion."
fresh,"The movie's heart is bursting, but it's still in the right place."
rotten,The reason to consider catching this is to watch the terrific performance by Rachel McAdams.
fresh,"""The Notebook"" is a story for those who believe that love is the most powerful force in the universe... or for those who merely want to."
rotten,"The movie's main problem is that it exerts so much effort coddling the pushovers, and does so little to make itself accessible to those with harder hearts."
fresh,A simple and incredibly romantic film that will thrill its target audience; women.
fresh,"Puppy lovers are allowed to slobber every once in a while, and the slight sins of this heartwarmer are easily forgiven."
fresh,Garner and Rowlands are so effortlessly wonderful that they make The Notebook worth seeing.
rotten,"Sparks' story and Cassavetes' heavy-handed direction sends The Notebook into something mechanical and gooey, like it had been artificially sweetened"
fresh,A sweet old-fashion love story that may inspire you to go home and start taking notes.
rotten,"See Noah and Allie lie in a darkened intersection, scrambling for safety when a car comes! See Allie on the porch wrapped in a sheet enjoying post-coital nude oil painting!"
fresh,"All in all a decent love story, but one suited for those who don't mind a high level of sentimentality."
rotten,"Still as thin as an advent calendar, as dry and overcooked as most Christmas roasts and with jokes even lamer than you'll find in a cracker, 15 years on, Deck has truly cemented its place as one of the all-time festive Hollywood turkeys."
rotten,There's ultimately not a whole lot contained within Deck the Halls worth getting interest in or excited about...
rotten,How do you have Matthew Broderick looking uncomfortable doing physical comedy when physical comedy and wit are his gifts?
rotten,This nonsense seems to have been conceived on the back of a snot-soaked tissue by a none-too-bright third grader.
rotten,Makes us miss those Home Alone days...
rotten,"The gags land like lumps of coal, but at least the unnatural mounds of fluffy white snow remain unsullied in the dreck."
rotten,"Ah, another lifeless comedy for the holidays. It's just super to be reminded how mean-spirited and grotesquely commercial the Christmas season can be, isn't it?"
rotten,The distasteful formula is even more sour and ham-handed than usual; Broderick's and DeVito's natural likeability never stands a chance.
rotten,a bit too faux-humbug for me
rotten,banal
rotten,"When Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito team up for a comedy that can't even deliver one well-oiled joke, that's a big problem."
rotten,"Laden with false climaxes, the overstuffed plot leaves you exhausted well before the movie ends, and the amiable actors sleepwalk through their uninspired roles."
rotten,Even the most dimwitted of kids will see through this poorly made mishmash of every other holiday film.
rotten,"What's interesting about typical Hollywood Christmas movies is that regardless of how crass, vulgar, or mean-spirited they may be, by the last scene they will inevitably try to wrap viewers in a blanket of warm seasonal cheer."
rotten,"'My stupidity astounds me!' chortles Danny DeVito in Deck the Halls, a line that pretty much sums up this tale of warring neighbours with very different ideas about celebrating Christmas."
rotten,Got any kids who've been naughty this year? Here's their present.
rotten,"This one follows the depressing pattern of Surviving Christmas and Christmas With the Kranks: enforced holiday cheer gives way to bilious hatred, then hollow forgiveness."
rotten,"Not that we expect much from a Holiday movie about neighbours competing over Christmas lights (how familiar is that?), but John Whitesell's film is so lacking in any plausible plot that I squirmed in my seat throughout the entire duration of the screening"
rotten,"None of this is ever funny, and what's more, we just don't care."
rotten,seems to have only been greenlit because producers know that families need PG-rated dreck to occupy the kiddies while mom is out shopping for Christmas presents.
rotten,"Deck the screenwriter, deck the director--then go and deck your own halls."
rotten,The lights go off pretty fast on this one.
rotten,"Caso você seja diabético(a), cuidado ao assistir a Um Natal Brilhante, pois há um grande risco de vir a sofrer uma hiperglicemia provocada pelo excesso de água-com-açúcar."
rotten,"A few laughs are sprinkled in this equivalent of a lame sitcom holiday episode, but the broad comedy and treacly ending are unlikely to put anyone in the Christmas spirit."
rotten,"Watching ""Deck the Halls"" is like getting a lump of coal in your stocking. Except receiving a lump of coal takes only seconds, while this awful movie goes on for an hour and a half."
rotten,"[Deck the Halls] wants to be both naughty and nice, but just ends up feeling deeply confused."
rotten,You might be wondering just when the heartwarming spirit of the season is going to come crashing down upon these boy-men.
rotten,"You can't even say Deck the Halls lacks the courage of its convictions, because it doesn't have any"
rotten,A box of Christmas movie clichés wrapped in tired slapstick and tied up with a bow made of trite lessons about the 'true meaning of Christmas.'
rotten,It's not enough to be set at Christmastime. Deck the Halls has no Christmas spirit.
rotten,Can't we just deck director John Whitesell instead?
rotten,"Like that holiday fruitcake that nobody wants, here's another stale and joyless Christmas comedy."
rotten,Deck the theatres with mediocre material... fa la lame.
rotten,At least it isn't offensive.
rotten,"I love the Christmas season, but there are times when I wish it would go away if only to save audiences from horrific experiences like this."
rotten,There is something about the holiday season that brings lazy filmmakers to pitch meetings with Frank Capra knockoffs clutched in their sweaty paws.
rotten,"It's a holiday ritual: Each year, American moviegoers get the misanthropically stupid, plastic-satire-of- a-plastic-society Christmas comedy they deserve."
rotten,"What's plentiful are stupid pratfalls, obvious plotting, cozy homilies and a big helping of saccharine moralizing."
rotten,In the tradition of Christmas with the Kranks and Jingle All the Way comes Deck the Halls; another Christmas lump of coal sure to dampen the yuletide glee of anyone pumped for the holidays.
rotten,"I literally did not count a single laugh in the whole aimless schlep, except for the hucksters who made it, on their way to the bank."
rotten,"Filled with forced yuletide cheer and mixed messages about the true meaning of Christmas, this loud and obnoxious holiday comedy boasts a fine cast and little else."
rotten,"As long as atrocious, fake-pine duds like this keep making their money back, there's no such thing as a Christmas that's too commercial."
rotten,Looking for some early holiday cheer? Look at anything but Deck the Halls.
rotten,"The raw ingredients of this crass holiday comedy include an inept stab at Home Alone-style slapstick, sitcom-thin characters, a snickering attitude about tacky yuletide decorations and a good helping of smarmy sentimentality. Merry Christmas!"
rotten,"I'm tired of filmmakers, screenwriters, directors and studios that believe every holiday is its own excuse for making films."
rotten,"Does anybody in Hollywood celebrate Christmas anymore? You have to wonder, with the woeful Christmas fare that has been hurled at us the past few years."
rotten,A holiday farce that pairs a colorful cast with a generic filmmaker.
fresh,The ending is so sweet that it'll send your family out of the theater for 3 1/2 solid minutes of smiles before everyone starts drinking and pointing fingers again.
rotten,"As reliable as your Aunt Harriet's sweet potato casserole, every holiday season brings a movie just like John Whitesell's Deck the Halls, in which otherwise sensible actors commit themselves to a cheerless exercise in jingle bell hell."
rotten,"Deck the Halls, a flabby attempt at false holiday cheer opening in theaters today, resembles an inflatable Santa after vandals have gotten to it."
rotten,"When you're starting to think that maybe sneaking out and going to see ""The Santa Clause 3"" would be a better use of your time, you know you've stumbled upon a truly wretched film."
rotten,Movies like Deck the Halls should make us all thankful that Christmas only comes once a year. What other season could possibly inspire a story as insipid as this?
rotten,"A low in soulless Hollywood Christmas movies, and more celebration of consumerism than condemnation."
fresh,"Although it borrows ingredients from many familiar Christmas flicks, it's got a sly twinkle of its own."
rotten,"Since this is ostensibly a holiday family picture, things never get so nasty as to be Bad Santa-style outrageous, unless you think a rigged speed-skating competition or a cross-dressing local sheriff is the height of hilarity."
rotten,You cannot believe how excruciatingly awful this movie is.
rotten,...this sour eggnog combines bad taste with ersatz holiday cheer.
rotten,How come the talk-radio blowhards never bring movies like this up when they're inveighing against the War on Christmas?
rotten,"Broderick and DeVito must be mentally, physically and spiritually exhausted by the sad, tired quality of these lame gags."
rotten,There must be an underground contest in Hollywood to see who can make the worst Christmas movie...Hang the Crepe would be more appropriate.
rotten,"Flimsy and fumbling - bah, humbug!"
rotten,"has no real heart and certainly not a trace of warmth. You may leave the theater with a strong desire not to decorate a tree, but to deck the person who talked you into seeing this turkey."
rotten,"Mr. Broderick and Mr. DeVito look tired and out of sorts, and you can hardly blame them, given the picture's inept, curdled mixture of sappiness and crude humor."
rotten,So bad it almost makes me renounce Christianity altogether.
rotten,"OK, yes, I laughed. I've seen so many awful movies this year that I think I'm punch-drunk."
fresh,The quintessential Hollywood Christmas movie. It's Grumpy Old Christmas.
rotten,"After seeing the trailers and commercials for this one, I was convinced it would be utterly detestable, but it turns out Deck The Halls is only majorly annoying. I guess that is a step up."
rotten,"...one of those dreadful, pandering, seasonal pictures that sneaks into theaters, Grinch-like, and makes off with tons of cash each year."
rotten,"Goodness knows we could all use some more butternut squash, especially during the holidays."
rotten,"Another year, another cheesy, hypocritical movie about how the true meaning of Christmas gets lost in the madness of Christmas. Except that this movie is, in itself, Exhibit A in the Christmas Madness category."
rotten,... so contrived and utterly stupid in every way that it surely must be the nadir of the genre.
rotten,"Like a fatally snarled string of Christmas lights, Deck the Halls promises holiday cheer but delivers only frustration."
rotten,"In essence a title and release date in search of a movie, Deck the Halls is a lifeless, workmanlike comedy conceived to provide holiday shoppers an inoffensive respite from the mall."
rotten,Deck the Halls muddles along with rote characters and unimaginative gags that will amuse very few.
rotten,"It's Bottom Ten bad, destined to wind up on end-of-the-year 'Worst Of' lists. It may still be there at the conclusion of this century."
rotten,"... a mirthless comedy with Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick as warring neighbors, can be described as whatever is the opposite of a Christmas classic."
rotten,"... Deck the Halls has a cute, if ho-ho-hum story, which makes it more like getting that nice sweater from grandma -- again."
rotten,"It's not horrible, but every sight gag and 'real meaning of Christmas' speech has been seen and heard before, and it steals gratuitously from Chevy Chase's masterpiece National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation."
rotten,"A one-part mean-spirited, one-part saccharine, all-parts forgettable piece of fluff."
fresh,"Deck the Halls is no classic, but it has its amusing moments and its tender ones ..."
rotten,"The word 'comedy' only applies loosely; the laughs are strictly sporadic, and not even Danny DeVito's gruff appeal is enough to overcome the soulless cynicism at the heart of this paint-by-numbers exercise."
rotten,Deck the Halls strains to be both naughty and nice with much clamor and not much conviction.
rotten,... Deck the Halls has little to recommend it.
rotten,It's disappointing to see Broderick and DeVito try to make mediocre material work.
rotten,"Nothing says Christmas quite like incompetent slapstick, saccharine sermonizing, and cavernous cleavage."
fresh,"As good-hearted as it may be, Deck The Halls is too lightweight to leave more than a fleeting impact."
rotten,"it unfortunately runs the original story through the Hollywood machine, rendering it a surface-level and boilerplate experience that dilutes the emotional profundity of its source material. All the while being a borderline unbearable snooze fest."
fresh,No doubt Alibar and Newman are just keeping as close as possible to the book. It is very much to their credit that they have committed so totally to giving the fans what they want without resorting to cheap fan service.
rotten,Where the Crawdads Sing makes for a decent if generic coming-of-age story and a bland murder mystery.
rotten,"Try as it might, Where the Crawdads Sing amounts to nothing more than a shallow tale of  otherness told through the lens of the prettiest, cleanest marsh girl you’ve ever seen."
fresh,A solid interesting idea with a fantastic performance from Daisy really makes the film from being average!
fresh,"The all-female team of director Olivia Newman, screenwriter Lucy Alibar, and producer Reese Witherspoon do a tremendous job of painting a seductive small-town feel to a mystery thriller that should be anything but that."
rotten,"Sanitized of any elements that could make this a marshy murder, Where The Crawdads Sing is a return to the type of films one would find in the Nicholas Sparksesque cinematic universe."
rotten,"With no reason to fear for her safety, the bulk of the film feels like a soap opera."
fresh,"Where the Crawdads Sing feels like a novel truly coming to life. The scripting, the dialogue, the scenery choices, the score, has it all of the pieces to make you feel its great pacing & progression. The story may be harsh but its all the more encouraging"
fresh,"An old-school murder mystery primarily told as a courtroom drama, the paperback adaptation entertains from start to finish."
rotten,"The book might have been a phenomenon, however the film lacks “the grits” of the original text. Sadly Where The Crawdads Sing becomes bogged down in courtroom drama tropes to truly sing in its own right."
fresh,…eventually settles for a fairly conventional Southern Gothic narrative with several plot points posted missing but a strong self-empowerment education message…
fresh,"Where the Crawdads Sing is a beautifully haunting story of one girl's quiet resilience in a film that floats across multiple genres: thriller, romance and, ultimately, survival story."
fresh,"""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is an imperfect but captivating drama."
fresh,"Mellifluous but never cheesy, the film seeks effective and healing tears for fans of this kind of fare, and treks through territory that isn't too minor. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The PG-13-ness of Where the Crawdads Sing buffs every rough edge off this story—the abuse, the abandonment, the betrayal, the sex, and even the alleged murder. It would be better off as trash."
fresh,A coming-of-age story and murder mystery about a young naturalist living in the marshes who has to find out who she can truly trust.
fresh,"Daisy Edgar-Jones dominates this role, she has the gift of reflecting any feeling without practically raising an eyebrow.  [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Where the Crawdads Sing isn’t terrible because it’s a romantic drama — it’s terrible because it’s terrible.
rotten,"Edgar-Jones’ easygoing allure isn’t enough to bind Where the Crawdads Sing together, though, leaving the film a generic, dull outing."
fresh,"Where the Crawdads Sing is a thought-provoking film, which could have easily just been another glossy movie without substance but instead it is an engaging tale with its intentional humanity."
rotten,Where The Crawdads Sing is the shallow prettification of the same-titled 2018 novel by Delia Owens that has sold more than 12 million copies.
rotten,The film is little more than an artistic tourist trap.
rotten,Too bad everything here is reduced to surface-level storytelling that drags on and on.
rotten,"Apart from gorgeous visuals of the North Carolina bayou and a committed performance by Daisy Edgar-Jones, Where the Crawdads Sing is a muddle through the marsh."
rotten,"'Where the Crawdads Sing' is just a handsome-looking and well-acted movie that, thanks to a shoddy screenplay and direction, is an absolute chore to sit through"
rotten,But there’s not much substance to this quasi-Gothic melodrama beyond vague squeakings about the cruelties of 20th-century American civilization.
fresh,"I guess it could be called a romance thriller courtroom drama. I had a few other names for it, but that doesn’t really matter. Let’s just say the movie didn’t make me mad. It didn’t make me much of anything."
rotten,The misguided idealistic tale balks over issues like rejection and survival.
fresh,"Despite its predictable twist and an age discrepancy concerning the deceased's wife, this film is worthy for its reflexion on toxic ties. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Kya is more a compendium of ideas than a character... and she has to carry all of those ideas on her shoulders and convey them in dialogue taken out of a book of aphorisms that underline all of which we already know. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Where the Crawdads Sing does its source material justice with an affecting adaptation delicately directed by Olivia Newman and dutifully led by Daisy Edgar-Jones.
rotten,"Ahead of its release, the buzz surrounding Where the Crawdads Sing was as loud as the birds circling the film’s swampy marshland setting. Unfortunately, this anticipated drama only treads water."
rotten,"the film tells its tale of abandonment, poverty, abuse, and murder in such a placid manner, smoothing over any possible rough edges, that it is bereft of emotional depth"
rotten,It’ll leave you wishing for the kind of movie this could have been.
fresh,Where The Crawdads Sing is worth taking the risk. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.
fresh,Newman and cinematographer Polly Morgan ... develop a beautifully rendered visual language that perfectly illustrates Kya’s heartbreaking story of isolation and survival.
fresh,The atmosphere of the marsh is accomplished by Cinematographer Polly Morgan.  You get the essence of sea marsh and what it takes to gain a living here.
fresh,What begins as a coming-of-age/young love story turns into a murder mystery about halfway through. It is still a simple story yet intriguing.
rotten,"Boring, at times, with a pieced-together script of confusing flashbacks, the movie doesn’t make the cut when compared the the beloved, best selling book."
rotten,This film is like the Instagram-influencer version of [Beasts of a Southern Wild] — a Goop post about its beautifying effects.
rotten,What should have been a murky trawl through the swamp of small-town suspicion instead feels sanitized and poorly fleshed out.
rotten,"It isn’t a terrible film, but neither is it good enough to stay afloat. Instead, it simply sinks into the marsh, out of sight and – rather quickly – out of mind."
rotten,"Overall, Where the Crawdads Sing lacks the drama, innovation, and pathos needed to make its story work. However, its solid lead performances from Edgar-Jones and Strathairn and its genre-reverential nostalgic charms may be sufficient for audiences."
rotten,"The new film adaptation, just like the book it’s based on, is pure bathos of the mushiest kind."
rotten,"If you’re mildly curious, but unsure if you feel comfortable putting money in Delia Owens’ pocket? Well, maybe check it out from the library in a few years."
rotten,"Cliched but absorbing enough, events transfer to screen with sensible direction from Olivia Newman coordinating production logistics."
rotten,"There’s an apparent lack of enthusiasm in the storytelling in this bland screen adaptation of the best-selling novel. The result is a dull, lifeless movie that is predictable, familiar, and far from challenging."
rotten,"A functional exercise in getting the plot put over without caring if it has been done well, or if the characters involved have any distinction or depth."
rotten,Sadly this is an average adaptation of a runaway best selling book.
fresh,It’s beautifully shot and Daisy Edgar Jones is just what I pictured as Kya.
rotten,"A barely credible story doesn't help this bland and sentimental, but eagerly-awaited, top-seller novel adaptation, despite the setting in the swampy, southern wilds and a good performance by the lead actor"
rotten,"Unfortunately, director Olivia Newman and screenwriter Lucy Alibar have delivered a film which is superficially pleasing to the eye but never makes its hard-scrabble themes punch home convincingly."
rotten,[Daisy Edgar-Jones] fails to steal scenes she’s central to though she does provide a consistent strength as a central roleplayer ... this project would likely turn out similar no matter who’d helmed it.
rotten,"A flat, flair-free and uninspiring adaptation."
rotten,Like the backdrop – marsh or swamp – it’s all a bit soggy.
rotten,It's impossible to reconcile Where the Crawdads Sing's careful words and dreamy vision of marsh life — such as the way its star is styled — with what the film tells rather than shows about its central character.
fresh,"Fueled by a strong performance by Edgar-Jones and pensive naturalism, Where the Crawdads Sing delivers a cinematic experience worthy of being seen."
fresh,A fairly engrossing entertainment -- a little bit slick and doesn't go in depth into the marsh.
rotten,Newman’s vision of rural South Carolina is scrubbed so clean you might as well call it #swampcore.
rotten,"... Even Edgar-Jones, at times firing on all cylinders as enfant sauvage Kya Clark, can’t quite save this much-hyped adaptation from an overdose of syrup and some deeply dubious subtext."
fresh,...a watchable yet thoroughly erratic drama...
fresh,"Where the Crawdads Sing is welcome summer relief from both the heat and the franchises. Always watchable, it loses some goodwill by shoe-horning too much into the third act and moving too quickly towards the credits."
rotten,"Blatant is a word I'd use to describe a great deal of Where the Crawdads Sing. There are opportunities here to get dark and grimy and edgy, but instead it feels polished and wiped clean, like so many fingerprints after a crime."
rotten,"Everything feels both fussy and perfunctory, and not a bit of it real."
fresh,"I found the film to be both moving and memorable. And, if that makes me part of a minority, that’s fine with me."
fresh,"A missed opportunity, Crawdads is still a worthwhile watch and proof that Daisy Edgar-Jones is Hollywood’s new star."
rotten,Where The Crawdads Sing turns a stirring and suspenseful story into cinematic mush.
fresh,"Edgar-Jones is compelling, showing us the vulnerability of Owens’s steely heroine. But the writer’s gritty themes are lost in a swamp of gorgeous cinematography and soapy plotting."
rotten,"Overall one can’t help but notice that Newman’s adaptation feels too clean, too glossy and too neatly packed to be in any way plausible, even with a fair amount of suspension of disbelief."
rotten,I’d rather eat a box of Caran d’Ache pencils than rewatch this mess.
fresh,"The film is a full-on melodrama, so what matters is not innovative storytelling but a series of emotional punches held together by a captivating character. On that score director Newman does her job by dutifully delivering those necessary needle jumps."
rotten,Where ihe Crawdads Sing needed a better script to fully draw me in.
fresh,"The haphazard storytelling eventually coalesces into a more coherent whole, and as dismissive as I felt earlier in the movie, the climax got me in the gut. And the tear ducts."
rotten,The film feels bland even in comparison to the book's rote romanticism.
rotten,The book’s cliches have won out and all the literary elements that made it unique have completely evaporated. Film is remorseless when it comes to stripping a novel down to its essentials.
rotten,"You never feel Kya’s connection to her environment, even though I’m guessing that should be of utmost importance. For a film about what it is to be wild it’s incredibly tame. Plus you don’t even encounter any crawdads."
rotten,"Box-fresh and laundered to a fault, the blandly attractive characters spend their time wandering along shorelines as if in an evasive American television commercial for prescription incontinence medicine."
rotten,"As it stands, Where The Crawdads Sing is a major disappointment, despite all the talent involved in the making of the film."
rotten,"The kind of lifeless, misguided adaptation that makes you wonder what anyone saw in the book in the first place. Unless the readers’ visualization imagined ‘Marsh Girl’ as the most camera-ready outsider from the danger-free swamps."
rotten,"A run-of-the-mill drama would be acceptable to many audiences who are looking for a diverting couple of hours, but it’s not going to cut it when the source material is so beloved,"
rotten,Plays like an all-white reboot of To Kill a Mockingbird with Edgar-Jones somehow getting to play Scout and Tom Robinson at the same time. And the big twist ending is an outrageously evasive cheat.
rotten,"The other problem with this cinematic adaptation is that dialogue and believable plotting are not Owens’ strength, so this suffocatingly faithful rendition imports all the source’s flaws intact."
rotten,"There are a host of other things wrong with the film, from poor pacing, to a lack of character depth, to heavy-handed themes...but Jones does her best with what she has to work with, and it may still strike an emotional chord if they don’t look closely."
rotten,The adaptation of Delia Owens’ bestseller has plenty of problems. The way it portrays older women is one of its biggest.
fresh,"Where the Crawdads Sing is compromised by voice-overs, inauthentic details..."
rotten,This 125-minute movie feels longer than that.
rotten,"After a relatively component opening sequence and a whistle-stop tour of Kya’s Dickensian childhood, the film gets bogged down in her variously icky romances, leaving the whole court case scenario to fend for itself."
rotten,"If you're seeking a movie with genuine wildness in it, or basically any element that you wouldn't find in a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, look elsewhere."
rotten,"Unfortunately, despite some seemingly smart choices in terms of screenwriter [Lucy Alibar] and lead actor [Daisy Edgar-Jones], this often seems lifeless and bland, lacking some of the nuance and emotional gut-punch of the novel."
fresh,"While the writing and direction are too controlled to allow for any realism, the actors find gorgeous textures in their characters, stirring in complexity that brings out the story's deeper themes about predators and inner strength."
fresh,"Perfectly serviceable and works as a solid enough mystery drama, but it’s hard not to wonder what it could have been. Edgar-Jones is excellent throughout, and, without her, the movie would have been much worse off."
fresh,"The film has its clichés, but a captivating lead performance and a powerful ending ultimately keep this movie watchable enough for any fans of Owens’s fascinating novel."
rotten,A pretty disappointing movie.
rotten,… an exercise in taking women-led stories backwards and feels like a Hallmark film with a decent budget and an A-list cast.
rotten,More effective as a glossy cottagecore fantasy befitting the Taylor Swift track written for the credits than it is as a tense tale of marshland morality.
fresh,"Slow, almost lazy, gothic kind of feel to it and I just wish it had more."
fresh,"The beauty of the natural setting and the central love story aren't quite enough to save this adaptation from the slippery slope of melodrama, but Edgar-Jones gives a stand-out performance."
rotten,'Where The Crawdads Sing' drowns itself in shallow waters.
fresh,A coffee-table mystery that admittedly hooked me when it narratively needed to and is likely to do the same for audiences versed with such artificiality.
rotten,Where the Crawdads Sing has all the charm of a wine mom novelty sign.
rotten,Kya’s [world] is so toothless and the aesthetic so rote that it feels like the creation of a committee of Instagrammers.
rotten,"What emerges on the screen lacks the pace, suspense and humor it needs to keep a general audience alert and riveted."
rotten,“Where the Crawdads Sing” will likely satisfy those who are interested in seeing the story they love brought to life by a cast of talented actors doing everything they can with the unchallenging script..
fresh,"While it doesn’t feel like a film built to see on the big screen, and the plot points are predictable, there is enough here to make book-readers appreciate the effort. Daisy Edgar-Jones elevates every moment she is on screen."
rotten,"This sincere/sentimental slog through the best-selling courtroom drama/murder mystery.coming-of-age saga romance has become disappointingly banal, evoking memories of sappy Nicholas Sparks novels."
fresh,"It doesn’t spoon-feed the audience or provide commentary regarding the law or morality. It makes you think, come to your own conclusions, and puts you in the body and mind of a character most of us couldn’t fathom being, much less temporarily inhabiting."
fresh,"Where the Crawdads Sing is an old-school Southern melodrama told in big, broad brushstrokes."
fresh,"Daisy Edgar-Jones is captivating as the “Marsh Girl” accused of murder in the diluted version of Delia Owens’ bestseller. Despite my grievances with the film, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker."
rotten,"With too many loose ends and tonal shifts, Where The Crawdads Sing is ultimately a disappointment for failing to live up to its own potential."
rotten,"It is a lifeless thing, untroubled by the energy of passion that is a necessary component to a story such as this."
rotten,"Anemic, clunky, overwrought, and so saccharine that it could give you a cavity."
fresh,"Crawdads aims to entertain, tug at the heartstrings and send a little quiver down your spine at true love and redemption, even if it feels less interested in what is real than it does in releasing another volume on Southern mythology."
fresh,"I wouldn’t say that Where the Crawdads Sing is groundbreaking in any way, but I love how it captures the beauty and mystery of Kya’s environment in the marsh. It will suck the audience in wanting to know the whodunnit, and yes, I did fall for the ending."
rotten,"There is a reason why the novel has grabbed such a broad audience, but you won’t find it here."
rotten,How this movie tries to shove Kya into a box that turns her story into a kind of cottagecore fairy tale is the source from which all its sins spring.
rotten,"If you’re looking for a good summer movie, this isn’t it."
fresh,WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is difficult to forget.
fresh,"I have to admit that the film got me, especially the last ten minutes.  I just don’t love the male savior complex that is the key to her salvation."
rotten,"The movie might as well be cinematic teflon -- it’s not overtly bad, and there’s enough content to sustain you through the running time, but don’t expect anything to stick."
rotten,"The hole-ridden plot infuriatingly descends into tiresome farce too often, the action sequences offer little in the way of surprises."
rotten,Henry Golding is good but he can't make the movie better than average.
rotten,"Assassin Club positions itself in the company of the John Wick franchise, yet without any of the charm or fun."
rotten,"Assassin Club has the benefit of starring a relatively well-known actor, Henry Golding, but even he can't save this movie from its mediocrity."
rotten,"While the ideal viewer of “Assassin Club” probably understands and accepts the limitations of this bottom-dollar time-waster, even the least choosy genre fans can do better."
rotten,"It's a plodding film, moving along at an infuriating slow pace."
fresh,"Assassin Club isn't about to knock John Wick off his perch, but it is an entertaining, turn-off-the-brain movie in the same vein as other '90s classics like Assassins and Hard Target."
fresh,The pacing does not help as clunky narrative fill like little more than placeholders before the next big shootout. Assassin Club is never aggressively bad – there are even times when it exceeds expectations. But it also feels like a missed opportunity.
rotten,"In or out of action, Golding isn’t anybody’s idea of a big draw, and pitting him against “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” Rapace, and pairing him up with Neill as the upper class Brit who gives the assassin his assignments doesn’t change that."
rotten,"“Assassin Club” has trained hitmen on the run to murder one another, crossing the globe to do so, but the whole thing is just impossibly dull."
rotten,"Flawless in its ineptness, Assassin Club misses the mark of being an entertaining over the top action spy game with every shot."
rotten,"With abundant visual razzle-dazzle trying to invigorate a pedestrian plot, this globetrotting thriller unfortunately squanders a talented cast."
fresh,"Assassin Club is a pulpy actioner that eventually lives up to the movie you hoped it could be. It’s just the challenge of getting there, that might be too arduous for some."
rotten,"Assassin Club plods along from hit to hit. Long bouts of exposition that are directed with little flair or verve bring things to a snail’s pace, sadly."
rotten,"Not only is the plot jarringly generic, but the swerving camerawork turns the action into a dizzying mess. Meanwhile, director Camille Delamarre encourages the cast to play everything far over the top."
rotten,"Incompetent and mostly just quite boring, Assassin Club doesn’t even have the good grace to be so-bad-it’s-good. Rough, rough stuff."
rotten,"A rote whirl of shootouts, stakeouts and extended chases around Europe’s major cities."
rotten,A dull potboiler that lumbers from one European city to another as various hired killers battle it out for murky reasons.
rotten,"None of it holds together, the action scenes are tedious and Golding’s permanently constipated-looking Morgan spends far too much time driving around aimlessly in his souped-up Audi, searching, presumably, for an exit out of the movie."
rotten,... Desperately corny and derivative.
rotten,"With a little more effort, love and care, Assassin Club could have been something. As it stands, it’s a missed opportunity and a truly torturous viewing experience"
rotten,…(Assassin Club) feels a lot like last decade’s model in terms of kick-ass thrills and espionage intrigue…
rotten,"Everyone is travelling economy, with a tatty script stuffed way down, out of shame, in their carry-on luggage."
rotten,"Director Julius Avery uses every horror genre cliché and tropes to create an eerie and atmospheric mood, but it all ends up being more cacophonous than chilling."
fresh,"No matter how much zany wackadoo nonsense you think it has flung at you, it still finds surprises and ways to remain fresh and unpredictable, quite literally up until the very last scene."
fresh,A solid performance from its leading man in a story which freshens up the delivery and messaging of an exorcism film delivers an overall decent horror flick.
fresh,Russell Crowe has an inordinate amount of fun in his horror film debut
rotten,A devil of a film.
rotten,Without Crowe getting to deliver lines like “A demon once tried to put a crucifix through my eyeball” with a twinkle in his eye this movie would be DOA.
rotten,The Pope’s Exorcist is not just another bad horror movie. It is a dangerous one.
rotten,The Pope’s Exorcist has a few original ideas but overall it is just a rehashing of previous exorcism films.
fresh,"Although pretty formulaic and full of the scares you'd expect, the lead performance from Russell Crowe and the horror visuals make it worth the watch."
fresh,"Crowe’s refreshing performance transforms a formulaic possession film into a fun romp. The Pope’s Exorcism is silly, dumb, and entertaining."
rotten,"Boilerplate blather, with the final battle an orgy of damning CGI satiety."
rotten,"The film's worst sin, though, is that it forgets it's supposed to shock us."
rotten,"Lost me the second it involved an American family with no money moving to Spain to renovate a centuries old abbey they inherited to sell with their 0 dollars. Other than a fun Crowe performance, this was cookie-cutter bland."
rotten,"It’s a junky pulp director’s movie, disposable and thoughtless and chucklesome. The scariest moment comes in the coda, with a painfully obvious bid for a sequel and a franchise. God forbid."
fresh,"Russell Crowe understands the assignment and brings what should be a redundant supernatural film to ""I might need more of these"" levels."
rotten,"Without possessing memorable qualities, it's a dynamic horror product that lives in the limbo of mediocrity. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"What works is Crowe's attachment to the attitude and belief of Father Amorth while enduring the standardized Hollywood fare... (including) plot similarities to The Nun, as if someone thought, 'Oh, we can do better than that,' and damn well proved it."
rotten,...a paint-by-numbers thriller that’s been suffused with some of the exorcism genre’s hoariest conventions and clichés...
rotten,It brings up tonal and thematic questions this frequently dumb movie doesn’t have the wherewithal to answer.
fresh,"Few horror films have so benefitted from the presence of such a genuine, effortless star."
rotten,... A film that doesn't do anything new with genre conventions and doesn't generate the dramatic depth it thinks it has. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"A tremendously fun exercise in demonic horror that manages to stand out among its peers by using its huge wit, its charming campy spirit, and a Russell Crowe in his element having a great time among crucifixes, holy water sprinklers, and bibles."
fresh,"The type of routine religious horror film that should be forgettable but isn’t, thanks to an engaging performance from Russell Crowe and a strong story that over delivers on what it promises."
fresh,"Russell Crowe provides a very charismatic performance, and there are intentionally funny moments throughout. The third act is when the movie goes overboard."
fresh,"If you’re a fan of horror or Russell Crowe, or better still a fan of both, this movie is a must-see."
rotten,The self-aware tone and Crowe's performance helps a fairly formulaic exorcism movie to stand out a bit. It still suffers greatly from the cliche's and redundancy that has plagued this subgenera for decades.
fresh,"But lest you think the movie sounds more serious or profound than it actually is, Avery is not the least bit interested in anything resembling depth or authenticity, and thank God for that."
fresh,"... the overall result manages to rise above its campy, pulp-horror plotting and well-worn, overused ideas."
fresh,"The central mother-daughter tension is well sold by its compelling duo and it offers perhaps a more realistic view of the situation than your typical, simplistic, Hollywood resolution."
fresh,"The Pope’s Exorcist doesn’t match the bone-deep terror or filmmaking heights of the original Exorcist, but sets itself apart by building the whole movie on an understanding that its whole premise is a little silly."
rotten,Within this film is an assortment of flavors; some will stand out more on your palette than others. One has to wonder how many messages have to get cut in a body for Pope’s Exorcist to realize it already had new elements to spell things out with.
rotten,Far too reminiscent of the tired and cliched genre it’s playing in to stand out in an exciting enough way.
rotten,"Viewers may hope that, half a century after “The Exorcist,” this new film must make new discoveries and attempt some original ideas for the exorcism subgenre of horror. But unfortunately, all they’ll find is a film as stale as expired communion wafers."
fresh,"The Pope’s Exorcist will certainly never go down as a classic of the genre, but it’s better than it has any reason to be. Sometimes, the devil you know gets the job done just fine."
rotten,"An absurdly plotted, blood-drenched haunted house movie...with all the vitality and vivaciousness of a 15th-century corpse."
fresh,"The Pope's Exorsict doesn't break new ground, but it's a solid enough entry in its horror subgenre."
fresh,"It’s hard to overstate just how much Crowe elevates this thing; he sails through each scene with a dancer’s grace, elevating the material without ever stooping to mock it."
fresh,Director Julius Avery's film makes up in eccentric entertainment what it lacks in genuine scares.
rotten,"Crowe is not enough to make The Pope’s Exorcist a good movie overall, but it gets the kick it needs with his presence."
rotten,"It isn't fun. It's so against fun, whenever it approaches fun it bounces off it like a negatively-polarized magnet."
rotten,Russell Crowe’s likeable performance is the only commendable aspect of this forgettable horror rehash.
fresh,"The demon possession elements all feel quite familiar, but this film gets a pass for Crowe's committed, not-too-serious performance. His Amorth is cool and in charge, but also sometimes charmingly goofy."
fresh,It is a powerful historical drama and Crowe is outstanding as a real life Vatican exorcist-in-chief.
rotten,"It is a combination of familiar ideas and tropes that may keep viewers entertained because of a fun performance from Russell Crowe. Avery injects enough style and darkness, but the script never allows it to stand out. It falls short of being fun enough."
rotten,"A noisy, murky, nonsensical, derivative horror movie wannabe."
rotten,"A tighter edit focused purely on the crazy bits could be a big cult hit; as is, it might be timed just right for a 4/20 viewing with plenty of smoke breaks."
rotten,"Russell Crowe understands the assignment, appropriately hamming it up, but the filmmakers here are caught between having fun with this absurdity and treating certain themes and clichés too seriously"
rotten,A watchable but far-from-special rehash of exorcism movie cliches.
rotten,"The Pope’s Exorcist may not be a comedy, but it does sometimes feel like a joke. On us."
fresh,"Crowe, giving us a sharp characterization of the unpredictable Amorth, is a godsend (sorry) for this movie, becoming the one genuine beacon of credibility in what is mostly a very Hollywoodized look at the subject matter."
fresh,"What it may lack in innovation, The Pope’s Exorcist readily compensates for in its spirited take on a tried and true concept."
rotten,"Congrats to Mr. Crowe, who joins the pantheon of bad accent movies which runs the gamut from Kevin Costner’s Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves all the way right back to Russell Crowe and his own Robin Hood."
rotten,“The Pope’s Exorcist” edges very closely into so-bad-it’s-good territory.
fresh,"Avery drives the film at a pace as caffeinated as Amorth himself, and manages to incorporate legitimate scares into a plot halfway between Indiana Jones and a Dan Brown potboiler, with camp touches worthy of Ken Russell."
fresh,"Whether Crowe was intensely going toe-to-toe with a malicious demon or puttering around Rome on an undersized Vespa while fully decked out in priestly regalia, I was onboard."
fresh,Russell Crowe takes on the devil’s army with an Olive Garden Italian accent.
fresh,"""'The Pope’s Exorcist' even has the gall to retcon the history of the church, which is the kind of pop punk theology that either endears you to the movie or turns you off it forever."""
rotten,At least Crowe’s instinct for hamming it up absolves him from the generic exorcism feature he’s found himself in.
rotten,All Crowe lacks is a Marvel cape and some DC tights and we’d have ourselves a priestly superhero — CatholicMan!
rotten,[T]oo much of The Pope's Exorcist amounts to the same-old.
rotten,"Never scary, wholly derivative, and mercifully short."
fresh,"The positives outweigh the negatives, but The Pope’s Exorcist is only a notch above being just another terrible movie about demonic possession."
rotten,"Bland, dumb and tedious while low on scares and thrills.  Does Russell Crowe want some cheese to go with all of that ham?"
rotten,"If you're going to do a movie called THE POPE'S EXORCIST, there should be more to it that you wouldn't see, or haven't seen, in a movie about your everyday garden-variety exorcist."

rotten,"A lot of a same old stuff in the feature, which does have the benefit of an engaged performance from Crowe, but as a chiller, Avery doesn’t provide a fresh approach."
rotten,"Russell Crowe hams it up as an Italian priest who performs exorcisms. But the jokes aren't funny enough to make The Pope's Exorcist a comedy, and the exorcisms aren't scary enough to make it an effective horror movie. It's just a loud and incoherent mess."
fresh,"When Crowe speaks with an Italian accent, it's like Chico Marx has risen from the grave and come back with the swagger of Serpico."
fresh,"It’s daft and camp good fun that ends with the set-up for a sequel, if not a whole franchise. However, it could have done with more pea soup."

rotten,"Director Julius Avery is still relatively new to his art, and his efforts here don’t add much to his resume."
fresh,The mix of horror with a dose of comedy and even The Da Vinci Code-style historical mystery may have been tonally unexpected but [Julius] Avery somehow manages to make it work.
fresh,"It doesn't pretend to be an extraordinary horror movie, and therefore never becomes one. What it does do, is give us a very entertaining and charismatic Russell Crowe, and several sequences of undeniable tension. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"I don't believe in God, because if he were real, he wouldn't have let this film be made."
rotten,"More of the same old religious-horror hoohah, plus Russell Crowe hamming it up, complete with terrible Italian accent. Its only twist on the usual exorcist-movie nonsense is genuinely pretty appalling."
fresh,... The film is highly entertaining and never takes itself too seriously. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"The Pope’s Exorcist is never particularly scary or thrilling, but it does manage to coast by on star power, thanks to a generously bonkers performance from Crowe, hip flask, scooter, and all."
fresh,"It’s not just the demonic possession victims whose eyes will be rolling back in their skulls – none of this should work, really, and yet the film just about gets away with it, proving the Lord truly does move in mysterious ways."
rotten,"Crowe is by far the film’s strongest suit, pre-empting (some of) our gigglier responses and mitigating against (some of) the material’s flimsiness."
rotten,The fact that everyone involved thought this was a good idea... is somehow far more terrifying than anything onscreen.
rotten,I've had more fun at Sunday mass.
fresh,"There’s nothing you haven’t seen before, but Avery puts it together with so much aplomb that you can’t help but have a good time."

fresh,"[Asmodeus is] not particularly scary at any point – the agents of Darkness are having an off-day, in that department. But the film sometimes finds an enjoyably silly sweet spot."
rotten,"If this hysterical hackwork has any soul at all, Crowe just about saves it."
rotten,"Russell Crowe brings humour, gravitas in an otherwise mediocre horror film."
fresh,Fun...Probably the most Catholic film you’ll see this year.

rotten,"It took a lot to be the worst reincarnation fantasy titled Jack Frost from the second half of the 1990s, but by golly, they found a way."
rotten,Jack Frost is so treacly and fake it makes you feel like you're trapped in a winter-wonderland paperweight.

rotten,"It will no doubt appeal to eight-year-olds, but anyone older than that can pretty much be prepared to get to know their watchface very well."
fresh,"This is a watchable, if by-the-book little movie."
rotten,Formulaic and charmless!
rotten,
rotten,"With all the realism of a muppet, the snowman tries to deliver the line, 'I love you.' PLEASE!"
fresh,It's just cheerful and bogus enough to keep children reasonably entertained.
rotten,A project with a good idea but nothing more!
rotten,Preachy.
rotten,Jack Frost oozes the kind of fake warmth that gives family films a bad name.
rotten,What makes it hard to swallow is that it's utterly inconsequential while pretending to be both hipper and more emotional than it really is.
rotten,"A sloppy, manipulative film, just another holiday trifle."
rotten,The film is shoddy from frame one.
fresh,Its heart is in the right place.

rotten,"Despite the many snowball fights and sledding hijinks, the movie seems a bit stuck on its preachy point."
rotten,"If Jack Frost doesn't prove that Hollywood is not only creatively bankrupt but actually in the hands of minions of Satan, then I don't know what does."
rotten,A sloppily written rehash of just about every other film where a dad disappoints his son due to a career.

fresh,A sentimental story with an icy edge.
rotten,It's hard to imagine the idea even looked good on paper.
rotten,Predictable!
rotten,Artificial and homogenized!
rotten,"For a movie that should mainly appeal to the 5-to-9 set, Jack Frost often aspires to odd glimmers of adulthood, or at least, teenhood."
rotten,The film is boring with a bad plot and so-so acting.
rotten,There is little sign of his acerbic wit here.
rotten,"No story, not enough humor, a silly setup, and a guy in the snowman suit who looks like he didn't make the first cut at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade."
fresh,"A very minor parable on paying attention to family while you can, Frost offers a wide range of passing diversions, from snowboarding derring-do to a minimally annoying computerized title character to lots of tender snowman-son bonding moments."
rotten,
rotten,Now we have proof: It's possible for the Jim Henson folks and Industrial Light and Magic to put their heads together and come up with the most repulsive single creature in the history of special effects!
rotten,"Its sentiment is rote, its truths are culled from a trip down the aisles of a greeting-card shop."
fresh,A holiday tearjerker par excellence!
rotten,"Not to be confused with the horror film of the same name, this Jack Frost is still so frightening I'd hesitate to put it before any child who ever plans to see a snowman."
rotten,"The snowman, which is the work of Jim Henson's Creature Shop, is the most glaring problem. It looks about as real as a man in a costume, and it's tough to suspend disbelief when you're trying to locate the zipper."
rotten,We don't even get the satisfaction of seeing the snowman melt like the classic Frosty the Snowman cartoon.
rotten,as tacky-looking as a plastic tree bedecked in ornaments from the dollar store...
rotten,"One of those dumb, corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film, but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching."

rotten,The movie is simply bad bad bad.
rotten,The novelty of the snowman effects wears thin after a while.
fresh,A slickly packaged and engagingly sentimental fantasy-comedy that stands out as one of the season's most pleasant surprises!
rotten,Jack Frost is about as warm and inviting as a snowball in Iceland.
fresh,Schwarzenegger's charisma helps somewhat. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,...the movie benefits substantially from Schwarzenegger's go-for-broke turn as the progressively frantic central character...
fresh,That rare family-themed Christmas movie that isn't really aimed at kids. It's actually aimed at adults... It's a family Christmas movie that's completely honest about what family Christmases tend to be like!
rotten,Watching Arnold Schwarzenegger take a stab at light-hearted comedy is often like watching a whale try to maintain its balance on a gymnastics beam.
rotten,"Regardless of how crazy it was, it is actually still entertaining. You can't help but laugh at some of the madness. Pure madness."
rotten,"I have a soft spot for it, because I saw it so many times as a kid, but this is not a good movie."
rotten,"The film is very loud, and festooned with the sort of comic violence far more disturbing than anything in an 18-rated movie."
rotten,
rotten,Ahnold terminates the holiday spirit.
rotten,"Of course, the kid will eventually realize that fatherly love means more than money (if forced to choose), and that he has the real Last Action Figure in good ol' Dad."
rotten,still heartless and unfunny and as welcome a part of the holidays as traffic and fruit cake.
fresh,"Home Alone, this is not, but for a family Christmas movie, it's surprisingly fun."
rotten,"In this formulaic star vehicle, Schwarzenegger gets to fly like Peter Pan, act like Superman--and fulfill all the fantasies kids may have about their fathers."
rotten,
rotten,"If it weren't for the credits 'A Brian Levant Film' and 'Directed by Brian Levant,' one would be certain that the director was Chris Columbus."
rotten,
fresh,OK family fun casts Arnold with Sinbad.
rotten,
rotten,And one wonders why Sinbad hasn't made any movies since
rotten,"The practice of buying indulgences didn't die with the Middle Ages, it just sort of metastasized into something black and malignant at the heart of our society."
rotten,"While there's some genuine laughs and warm sentimentality to be had, Brian Levant's Jingle All the Way represents everything that's bad with Christmas today."

rotten,He's running California and he agreed to make THIS...
fresh,"Jingle All the Way won't win any awards for believability, but as purely escapist family entertainment on a grand scale it's a tough act to beat."
rotten,"You'll need an awful lot of Christmas cheer to forgive Arnold Schwarzenegger for his fourth, and hopefully last, venture into comedy, a turkey that needs stuffing on the most inaccessible shelf of your local video store."
rotten,Even the Grinch wouldn't like this one.

rotten,
rotten,
rotten,
rotten,"I liked a lot of the movie, which is genial and has a lot of energy, but I was sort of depressed by its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas, and by the choice to go with action and (mild) violence over dialogue and plot."
fresh,"Just like how it happens here, even Hollywood doesn’t mind revisiting mundane tropes only to have some fun. The film may not be original and refreshing, but Robert De Niro is as he calls himself in the film. He’s the father of all, as the title says."
rotten,Unfunny comedy.
fresh,"It’s an oddball movie that had me laughing out loud, perhaps not for reasons the filmmakers intended, but I enjoyed it anyway."
rotten,"What keeps About My Father a touch above tolerable for the most part is De Niro’s genuine and endearing chemistry with the movie’s nominal leading man, the popular American stand-up comedian Sebastian Maniscalco."
rotten,Clearly intended to be a cringe comedy a la Meet the Parents... but it stretches the concept of “funny” so thin that the memory of that scene in which a cat pees on the contents of a smashed urn will feel like dizzying comic heights in comparison.
rotten,"The characters are all very thinly drawn stereotypes, the comic set pieces and culture clash comedy are extremely tired, and the plot is so blandly predictable that you can map out the entire story from minute one."
rotten,I laughed maybe once or twice in this entire hour and half movie. Just not funny. You can see the jokes coming a mile away. If you've seen the trailer...you've seen all the best jokes in the trailer.
fresh,"Sebastian Maniscalco plays a leading man for the first time, and he delivers the goods. Robert De Niro never phones it in. Director Laura Terruso has made a very lean film and not a shred of the comic material is wasted."
fresh,We should not feel that the actors had more fun than the audience. Wait for streaming.
rotten,"Even with the presence of Robert de Niro, About my Father ends up being a film with few laughs, exaggerated situations, and a story you will quickly forget about in minutes. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"About My Father is 51 percent just fine, 49 percent irritating."
fresh,A sweet movie full of heart. Unfortunately all the best comedy scenes are in the trailer.
rotten,"The worst thing about the film is that it seems there's nothing, or no one, behind the camera. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The structure is so dull it's reminiscent of countless others, and the supporting cast, while celebrated, are merely there as decorations. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,About My Father seems a poor bet to nudge the uninitiated toward Sebastian Maniscalco’s touring act -- and it probably won’t do much for his surely doomed bid for rom-com lead legitimacy.
fresh,"I will admit that this is not my kind of comedy, but I was charmed in parts."
rotten,"A much less funny Meet the Parents meets a much less engaging My Big Fat Greek Wedding, with a dash of low-rent Wedding Crashers thrown in."
rotten,"Director Laura Terruso is hamstrung by the thin script, and what looks like the oversized ego of Maniscalco, who’s used to telling his jokes to arena-sized audiences — and doesn’t do much to modulate his delivery for the movie screen."

fresh,"Watch the film for the interaction between Sebastian Maniscalco and Robert De Niro, as also for its feel-good storyline."
rotten,About My Father has its heart in the right place; I only wish we got to see more of it in between the frequently stale jokes.
rotten,"About My Father is a harmlessly welcoming comedy that does not tread any new ground but has a good heart. At the very least, it has a cast of talented comedic actors led by the great Robert De Niro in his most energetic performance in a long time."
fresh,"Despite the ups and downs, Maniscalco proves to be a lucid observer of small details that define the characters with sufficient precision. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The dialogues are juicy, they spark, and the comic situations are well weaved in and captured by director Laura Terruso. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"By the movie’s end, the real joke is how far it takes smiling white obliviousness..."
fresh,"The movie's laughs start out slow, but once the characters arrive in Virginia, the humor picks up, with comedic situations you won't see coming."
rotten,...a pervasively hackneyed endeavor...
fresh,Sebastian Maniscalco brings winning stand-up persona to the big screen.
rotten,"The film only serves to reinforce outdated stereotypes in the grossest way possible, all while posing as yet another tired Meet the Parents retread."
rotten,A father/son comedy that sinks.
rotten,I particularly didn't appreciate when he literally serves the family their pet peacock for dinner. That's gross and unkind.
rotten,"There are zero laughs, jokes that make no sense and situations that are neither elevated for an attempt at genuine farcical comedy or deescalated to find the heart of its central relationship. There is nothing to recommend here."
fresh,"It made me smile, even though it didn't make me laugh."
rotten,"It’s not something that can really hold a viewer’s attention, even with its short runtime. You should sit this out, wait, and watch it at home if you want to see it."
fresh,"Sebastian Maniscalco handles what could have been underwhelming material well, its a heartfelt tribute to his own father. Class jumping, hypersensitivity, and awkward culture clash melees tell a recognisable story"
rotten,"At times sweet and occasionally funny, the film leaves a lot to be desired despite a stellar cast, and is an exercise in wasted potential."
fresh,"This film has laughs, but it's less of a fit for Sebastian Maniscalco, whose stand-up is more direct and tart. Why do a CADDYSHACK/WEDDING CRASHERS/MEET THE PARENTS mash-up when there is more original themes to explore? But I laughed, and Sebastian rules!"
rotten,About My Father comes across as generic and forgettable.
fresh,"Considering how hilarious Maniscalco is in his shows, I was hoping for a more consistently funny experience. It's not that the film isn't fun—it's that it feels like a nice and funny movie, but it COULD be so much… more. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,About My Father is just a mishmash of scenes that look like stale leftovers from a second-rate sitcom. Robert De Niro is doing another 'grumpy old man' character that he keeps doing in awful comedies that fail to match the quality of Meet the Parents.
rotten,A light-hearted film with themes of lying makes it an interesting watch that leaves viewers confused about the overall message.
rotten,"Love Hard doesn’t try to be any of those movies, but the magic and chemistry between the romantic leads are just nowhere to be found."
fresh,"Love Hard might not be anything close to required viewing, but it still is quite a fun film to start the holiday season."
fresh,...a mostly watchable (yet entirely forgettable) romantic comedy...
fresh,I was amused watching the writers try to twist this strange premise into a happy ending.
fresh,Jiménez is a fine director of actors. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Instantly forgettable, like a gift you get at an office holiday party."
fresh,"Despite the high level of predictability and a plot which doesn't offer anything new, Love Hard is worth watching if you're a casual rom-com fan."
rotten,"The film is not totally charmless, with Dobrev proving herself an adequate comic actor...The film demonstrates how the over-use of pop references isn't in anybody's interests. [Are] the creators of Die Hard and Love, Actually entitled to royalties[?]"
rotten,Love Hard just might be the lowest of lows for Netflix rom-coms.
fresh,Don't look for it to reinvent the Christmas rom com. It plays out the genre's checklist with some unexpected laughs and charm making for a winning start to the 2021 season.
rotten,I couldn't get over the awkward premise and what it did to the chemistry
fresh,"Love Hard is no doubt, yet another generic Christmas movie."
rotten,"A Hallmark Channel holiday movie on a Netflix budget. The characters are bland, the performances not much better and the writing almost instantly awful"
fresh,"Love Hard is charming, heartwarming, and just the best way to kick off the holiday rom-com season."
fresh,"The film is entertaining, and I laughed a whole lot, but it isn't a good rom-com."
fresh,"What starts out feeling like a rehash of a dozen romcoms you've seen before turns out to be a film that slowly, albeit unevenly, constructs its own charm."
rotten,"The film, though frothy and disposable, does have some endearing moments, but with better casting, Love Hard potentially could have risen above its VOD trappings."
fresh,It's hard not to love Love Hard.
rotten,"American rom-coms have become a zombie genre, and brainless streaming content like Love Hard -- from its tech-driven narrative, nostalgic plotting, and tossed-off production -- epitomizes why they refuse to die or be reborn."
rotten,The choppy execution fumbles any chances to be better than the problematic Christmas songs and movies it holds in contempt.
rotten,"Opposites attract, always and forever... and yet the screenwriters never bother to develop a plausible path for the destined couple to find its way to each other."
fresh,"A romantic comedy set during Christmas sounds like a something that will follow the familiar formula, and while it does to a degree, the charm of the characters manages to carry this heartwarming film to success."
rotten,The ensuing shenanigans not only do our heroine a massive disservice by letting men manipulate her agency - they also cause us to question what exactly we're rooting for.
rotten,This cookie cutter rom-com has nothing more or less than what its subgenre demands.
fresh,"Although Love Hard follows the typical formulaic plot and clichés, Nina Dobrev and Jimmy O. Yang are charming in their roles as two imperfect people trying to find love."
fresh,"In a world of fast-paced modern dating that appears to focus on polyamory relationships and narcissistic conquests, Love Hard reminds audiences that being authentic is way more powerful."
fresh,"As micro-budgeted Canadian-shot yet American-set Christmas romantic comedies go, Love Hard is more tolerable than most and, in Netflix's dank grotto of subterranean expectations, that will do for now."
fresh,"With dazzling lead performances from Jimmy O. Yang and Nina Dobrev, Love Hard will surely be a Christmas romantic comedy worth revisiting every year."
rotten,"In presenting a female character who is attractive, but bereft of substance, the movie subverts its own premise."
rotten,"A glossy but shallow Hollywood adaptation of the hit French film Lol: Laughing Out Loud. The original director, Liza Azuelos, is at the helm too, but the sass and spark of the French movie seems to have been lost in translation."
rotten,"It's a shame in a year that gave us ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" we have this tepid piece of junk."
rotten,Miley Cyrus overacts in sex 'n' drugs high school drama.
fresh,"What's of real interest here...is the casual, unforced portrayal just how indulged, spoilt, undisciplined and self-centred these iGen teens are."
rotten,Humdrum all the way.
rotten,"LOL is DOA, a shapeless and charmless teen-skewing trifle stocked with trendy slanguage and social-network gimcracks that make it seem like something four years past its expiration date."
rotten,"Actually, LOL is a lot like an episode of Gilmore Girls, only the mother and daughter are total creeps and the characterizations are completely insulting."
rotten,"I’m afraid anyone who isn’t already indoctrinated into the world of Bert “The Machine” Kreischer will struggle to find entry via this movie, which is too long, too stupid and not nearly as funny as it thinks it is."
fresh,"On brand with Kresicher’s stand-up persona, the film pulls some punches but manages a workable story and some laugh-out-loud moments."
fresh,"Look, ""The Machine"" doesn’t break the mold in terms of how Bert goes from the worst dad to a better human, but it’s entertaining and possesses quite a few surprises thanks to the structure, editing, performances, and action."
rotten,'The Machine' works as a comedy ... sometimes.
fresh,"Nothing about this comedy should’ve worked and it definitely shouldn’t have ended up being as entertaining as it actually is, but here is one of those rare success stories where a little movie plays to its strengths and comes out on top."
rotten,A so/so comedy/action film.
fresh,"If throat punches and drop-kicked dogs are not up your alley, steer clear. Everyone else, down your drinks and get ready because The Machine is the real deal and deserves to be watched in a theater full of fans ready for big-screen comedy."
rotten,...the picture begins to adopt a generic action-movie sensibility that grows more and more tiresome as time progresses...
rotten,"Honestly, the only thing less convincing than Kreischer as some kind of Everyman comedy icon, or as an ersatz action hero, is the idea that he’d have something to teach Russian mobsters about drinking vodka."
rotten,"This clumsy, chunky movie based loosely on Kreischer's comedy material is meant to be a cut-loose fun time, but it's so lifeless (and long) that it feels more like a painful hangover."
rotten,"Honestly, I love a good gonzo binge comedy as much as the next guy, and I found almost nothing funny in this."
rotten,"You may wonder, if Kreischer is such a popular stand-up comedian, why he hasn’t done more television and movie acting. Well."
rotten,"""The Machine"" is ultimately not funny enough to work as a comedy and not thrilling enough to work as an action movie. It's just a middle-of-the-road movie that perhaps die-hard fans of Kreischer can appreciate more."
fresh,"Kreischer fans are surely The Machine‘s target audience, and I suspect they’ll gel enthusiastically with his brand of comedy"
rotten,The comic’s preexisting fans should find plenty to love... But anyone who goes in hoping for any kind of literary substance would be better off just reading the nutrition facts on their Junior Mints box.
rotten,Bert Kreischer’s schtick is irritating and gets old fast
rotten,"It’s a movie specifically engineered to build Kreischer’s brand, and he’s the least appealing element in it."
fresh,"The Machine is loud, gross, obnoxious and overbearing. It’s also disarming, quick-witted, fast moving and becomes increasingly funny."
rotten,"An unimaginative and toothless dark comedy that's more much meanspirited and dull than funny. It's just as disappointing as Renfield, Mafia Mamma and About My Father."
rotten,The best thing about The Machine is it’s not as awful as it could have been for a movie based on stand-up.
rotten,"The Machine is a stumbling-drunk comedy that never finds its identity, caught between lackluster lesson-teaching and underwhelming insane-in-the-membrane storytelling."
fresh,It’s a wacky and raucous good time.
fresh,"The Machine has enough going in its favor to warrant a recommendation to fans of Kreischer's stand-up comedy, but other audience members may walk out feeling empty."
rotten,It's a meandering mess of a movie and one that never gives us even a vague idea of the tenor or quality of Kreischer as a comedian.
rotten,"Crude, boring, and obnoxiously stupid, The Machine repeatedly misfires and malfunctions as a showcase for stand-up comedian Bert 'The Machine' Kreischer, who portrays a version of himself in his first starring movie role."
fresh,"Both the narrative exposition, an inner drama that is reflected on the outside, and the cinematographic tools offer an intense, reflective and conscious perspective on the condition of the man trapped in himself. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,It's so close to being a really good movie that it really hurts when Mine blows up in your face.
rotten,"At times laughably gabby, Mine never recovers from a derelict script that's awash in cliché."
rotten,Mine is a film that is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is...this directorial debut from Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro is all conceit and no substance.
rotten,"Hammer does a fine job in his largely solo role, so it's a shame directing duo Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro choose to saddle him with several hallucinatory/real visitors during his ordeal."
rotten,"Stylishly shot, although somewhat flawed."
rotten,"It's hard not to feel bad for Armie Hammer through all of this. ... he's asked to do little more than endure suffering, like Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant, except less interestingly shot."
rotten,"... becomes repetitive and increasingly far-fetched, which diminishes the topical relevance of the material."
rotten,While Hammer does a fine job anchoring this endurance test of a film he can't save us from what is ultimately a dud.
rotten,"A tepid, lifeless, endurance test of a film that you'd gladly spend an eternity in the desert to avoid ever sitting through again."
rotten,"A jumbled, hodgepodge of ideas and images that spoil the initially intriguing premise."
fresh,"Every time that Mine threatens to come apart under its own pretensions (which is relatively often), Hammer does something subtle and believable to ground it."
rotten,"Mine is convoluted and utterly confused about the story it is telling, building up to one of the most infuriatingly anti-climactic finales in recent memory."
rotten,"The second half sees survival, oddly, as a form of therapy."
rotten,"For a film that's built on such a banger of a premise, Mine never leaves Mike alone for too long, robbing it of the tension and terror that made Mike's early solitary moments hit so hard."
fresh,The film is often a marvel of visual and narrative resourcefulness.
rotten,"""Mine"" is a classic example of a high-concept film that painstakingly sets up its unusual premise, only to squander it."
rotten,"It's a hard work for Hammer, who's trapped in feature-length effort that should've been a short film instead."
rotten,"""Mine"" shimmers with a dusty authenticity...But as more of Mike's clichd back story becomes clear over the course of a long 106 minutes, the film becomes almost as much of an endurance test for the audience as it is for Mike."
rotten,"The Fabios appear to have some talent, but not a lot of common sense."
rotten,"The clichés pile up fast in Mine, a thriller that tries trading off high-concept visuals and gritty realities for a theoretically walloping conclusion that never quite arrives"
rotten,"The co-director/co-writer team of Fabio Guaglione and Fabio Resinaro are none too subtle, and their reliance on hallucination sequences suggests a (misguided) lack of faith in Hammer to pull this off by himself."
fresh,"While it never quite lives up to the terrific first act, MINE is worth watching for Armie Hammer's performance alone."
rotten,"The film leans heavily on Armie Hammer's performance. And while he is a charismatic leading actor, he is not given enough to work with here to sustain the picture."
rotten,The film has absolutely no interest in the dilemmas or after-effects of war and occupation.
rotten,Armie Hammer's good performance as a marine fighting in North Africa cannot overcome a cornball script to which he must adhere.
fresh,"While the protagonist's back-story is not sufficiently original to sustain tension throughout, Hammer's committed performance keeps you watching ..."
rotten,"The situation at the heart of Mine - what to do if you're stuck standing on a live landmine - is fascinating to imagine. But sadly, the film eventually devolves into cliched flashbacks and quickly loses momentum."
rotten,"A film that displays, in its first part, a palpable capacity to keep the attention of the viewer but eventually the story goes to ridiculous extremes. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,You'll end up wanting the mine to explode once for all. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,A handful of funny moments can't rescue diet Woody Harrelson and a recycled sports story. Watch it when there's laundry to be folded.
fresh,The exact movie you expect from the trailer  & a straight definition of heartwarming fun
rotten,"Once you push past all the sentimentality, Champions struggles to stand out from the typical sports movie tropes and feels, dare I say, hollow in its representation."
fresh,This is a pretty powerful film that explores the serious themes of friendship and what it is like living in the modern world with a disability. This is a heart-warming film that delivers just the right amount of laughs as well.
rotten,"If Farrelly held back on extolling his magnanimity and took a more objective approach to the story and main character, the end result would’ve been as brave as the kids it portrays."
fresh,There may be more smiles than big laughs in this comedy from half the team that knows how to deliver them. But the smiles work well enough as does the relationship between Harrelson and Olson.
fresh,"Champions is just fine, yet there’s the nagging feeling that a more thoughtful and compelling story could emerge from an alternate version of the screenplay."
fresh,Champions may have you wanting to bounce a basketball in your driveway.
rotten,"There’s something noble in what director Bobby Farrelly is trying to do in his new movie, “Champions.” … But nobility is about intentions, not the results."
fresh,"Some critics are saying the film is patronizing and making a mockery of the disabled community, but that’s not the case. The cast brings out the best in each other and all are true champions."
fresh,"A film that follows formula pretty shamelessly, but should satisfy audiences looking for an easygoing crowd-pleaser with a sports theme and an inspirational message."
fresh,Wholesome and commendable. These fresh screen faces ooze charisma and have wonderful comic timing.
rotten,"It’s difficult to get past just how mediocre the film is overall. This has nothing to do with the players on the team; instead, it’s the C-level writing and ham-handed directing that brings the movie down."
rotten,Pretty much every beat of this three-screenwriter adaptation of a Spanish comedy of a few years back feels pre-ordained — from the Big Obstacles to the Big Secret revealed to The Big Game and even who and what provides the Big Moment in the Big Game.
fresh,"Predictability aside, everything about this movie makes it a feel-good winner except for the runtime and that really did impact the enjoyment."
fresh,I truly don’t think it’s Farrelly’s intention to offend.  I think he genuinely wants to undercut the notion that those suffering from this condition are capable of experiencing a life as full as those who are not similarly afflicted.
rotten,"[It's] too foulmouthed for family viewing, too saccharine for the Farrellys’ usual fan base, and too shallow to let the measured relationship between Harrelson and team chauffeur Kaitlin Olson take center stage."
fresh,"Woody Harrelson leads scene-stealing ensemble in wry, winning comedy."
fresh,"""Champions"" gives me faith that Hollywood still knows how to make good, entertaining movies."
fresh,"Bobby Farrelly balanced out the sentimentalism with a sassy ensemble, led by Woody Harrelson’s reliably spiky energy."
rotten,A cliched but occasionally amusing sports comedy.
rotten,"Despite having good intentions and a solid performance by Woody Harrelson, Champions doesn't reach the same heights of the original, crowd-pleasing Spanish hit. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Funny and surprisingly tender, it's a kind of coming-of-age story for a middle-aged coach."
rotten,"A defanged version of the Farrellys’ better movies, Champions is so focused on doing the right thing the comedy is sorely lacking."
fresh,"An enthusiastic Harrelson makes it work, and this creaky yet inherently uplifting display is fortunate to have him."
fresh,"Champions is about as formulaic as a film can be, but it certainly doesn’t lack heart."
fresh,"Woody Harrelson deftly leads a charming cast in an entertaining underdog sports movie that, despite playing in familiar fields, ultimately wins you over. {Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,t doesn’t overstay its welcome or take too much away from the main plot. The movie is very funny and heartwarming and does well in being a good basketball sports movie.
fresh,"Because it involves basketball and an anarchic central character, the film is also a nice play on Woody Harrelson's persona, offering him a chance to shine in a spiky but ultimately loveable role."
fresh,"A soft comedy, “Champions” may not move the needle in any significant way, but it shows there are often many games at play, no matter what the sport."
fresh,"Mirth these days simply can't be as unguarded as it was in the 1990s. If one accepts the world is a different place, champion laughs are easy enough to come by."
rotten,Champions scores in some areas and airballs in others.
rotten,There’s a self-righteousness to Champions that feels entirely unearned.
fresh,"Yet despite Champions' lack of surprises, it does have its charms, chief amongst them The Friends teammates, who all play to their strengths."
fresh,The film fights hard to draw humour from the players’ often eccentric demeanours without holding them up to ridicule. For the most part it succeeds.
fresh,"Champions is the sort of amiable, sweet, slightly low-energy film you could watch on the back of someone else’s seat during a flight and forget by the time you touch down."
fresh,"Despite its predictability and few instances of poor judgment, ""Champions"" has enough crowd-pleasing mojo to make it worth sitting through. And it also has Woody Harrelson who carries much of the movie on his back."
fresh,"Champions is a run-of-the-mill, feel-good sports comedy, featuring a stellar disabled supporting cast who don’t get nearly the depth and focus that they deserve."
fresh,"If somehow you're expecting Shakespeare, please know that even the beloved Bard earns mention as so uniquely included in such an unlikely concoction from Robert ""Bobby"" Farrelly, directing for a first time away from Oscar-winning brother Peter."
rotten,You know where this goes and unfortunately Champions is first in cliches and last in originality.
fresh,What makes Champions a treat is the deftness with which Mark Rizzo’s script sidesteps sentimentality in favour of something more raucously truthful...
fresh,"“Champions” is a featherweight and predictable, but it’s still a breezy feel-good flick."
fresh,“Champions” leans into Farrelly’s penchant for sentimentality with heart-warming results.
rotten,"Therein lies the rub when it comes to Champions: the movie is so well-intentioned that criticizing it feels like kicking a puppy, but it also rarely rises above the level of patently mediocre."
fresh,"""Champions"" is wholesome and uplifting family fare. You can't go too wrong with it, even though some of it is sort of wrong. Many decent chuckles available here."
rotten,"Champions has its heart in the right place... It’s possible to admire the message, though, without thinking much of a movie that, Marcus’ aspirations notwithstanding, belongs in the minor leagues."
fresh,"Overall, Champions is endearing at times with some slow moments, but it’s a good movie if you’re a fan of the genre."
fresh,The grass-roots charm keeps the film alive with imperfect characters that manage to grow without being mean-spirited.
fresh,"Woody Harrelson offers a winning, low-key performance with a high feel-good percentage."
fresh,"This 124-minute movie is an English language remake of the 2018 Spanish film Campeones (Champions). It does have a few look-or-look-away Farrelly moments, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but overall it is a warm-hearted, feel-good movie."
fresh,"Champions is a forward-thinking film masquerading as a deeply conventional one. We can say we’ve seen it all before—but when, and where?"
rotten,"Farrelly occasionally defaults to his early 2000s settings, with fart jokes, projectile vomiting, and a bit of racy talk, but Champions doesn’t really deliver as a comedy."
rotten,It's shaggy around the edges and never quite takes full advantage of the formula it's co-opting. It's the kind of movie you want to root for more than you end up actually rooting for it.
rotten,"Made me uncomfortable as the writer had the developmentally disabled adults, cast as the players, spouting lines out of a cheap sitcom or sex farce. Yeesh. And I'm sorry, but could someone wake up WH and get him to emote? Mitigating ... disabled advocacy."
rotten,"Champions has a few laughs and plenty of heart, even if it does tread familiar ground."
rotten,"In terms of casting, the film makes great strides. But the comedy is still often tone deaf and cringy."
fresh,"Is it formulaic? Yes. Does it reach Kingpin heights? No. But Champion’s an engaging watch, and the ensemble of developmentally challenged actors upstages the pros."
fresh,Champions delivers a slam dunk by spinning the overused storyline into a vulnerable and authentically funny film that will leave you laughing from start to finish.
rotten,Misses its shot.
rotten,Yet with Olson’s carapace of toughness and Harrelson’s tenderness there’s a beautiful portrait of a tentative love match slowly flowering in middle age. They should have made that movie. Not the coach one.
rotten,"It would be unthinkable not to immediately adore these players, the movie posits, just by virtue of their existence. And so Champions is never inclined to strain to define any of them much beyond that."
fresh,"An unapologetic feel-good film from one of the Farrelly brothers, making his solo directing debut."
rotten,"With thinly sketched characters and predictably corny plotting, it adheres to a well-worn game plan."
rotten,There’s a creative and spiritual deficit to a film that means to humanize by way of unconsidered art.
fresh,A cheering watch.
rotten,"There is plenty to applaud in Champions; the casting is on-point and the ending is moving, if manipulative. But much like Marcus’ sexual capabilities, as noted by Alex, the film is merely passable."
rotten,It’s yet another one of those movies that pretends to be about a marginalized group but uses that group solely to contribute to the growth of some selfish protagonist.
fresh,"The actors who play the team members are spirited, ebullient, confident performers with vivid personalities. They also bring out the best in Harrelson, who responds to them with what appears to be genuine warmth and delight."
fresh,"Olson's warmth and strong presence, and her excellent chemistry with Iannucci are the heart of the film."
rotten,"Champions is not the slam-dunk it thinks it is, and ultimately it does a disservice to the people it wants to champion."
fresh,"“Champions” doesn’t break any molds, narratively or aesthetically, and it’s too long, but what sets it apart are the Friends, who offer warm and nuanced performances"
rotten,It's fine if “Champions” wants to double-dribble across sports-movie tropes. But it’s far too easy to call foul on a story that can feel as reductive off the court as it is empowering on it.
fresh,"The point about Champions is that Bobby Farrelly knows his business, which includes knowing when he can safely tug on our heartstrings and when it’s necessary to liven things up with, say, a well-timed bit of projectile vomiting."
rotten,"As the runtime lumbers on to the two-hour mark, with one scene after another fizzling out, its warm nimbus of niceness seems to be the sole reason for its existence."
fresh,... Formulas exist for a reason. Great performances from the youngsters and a rousing and witty script make this a slam dunk for fans of big-hearted comedies.
rotten,"It all goes to show that, once again, making a sanded down American remake of an already fine film will often miss the mark."
fresh,"It is by no means perfect... but just when you think you know where this heartwarming movie is headed, it throws a little shimmy or feint that leaves you smiling at its chutzpah, nimbleness and sheer desire to entertain."
rotten,"Unlike more satisfying formula jobs,  Champions takes its shot only to watch the ball bounce off the rim."
fresh,A solid family film with winning performances from all involved.
fresh,"Even though the plot is riven with clichés and as predictable as the tides, driven by a soundtrack of cheesy power-pop classics, by the end you just want to hug everyone in it."
fresh,The film may be meh. Its young cast is mighty.
rotten,"The movie itself is stilted and trite, hitting all the prerequisites for the genre in workaday fashion."
rotten,"Disarming one minute, baldly manipulative the next."
rotten,"The main thing you need to know is it is so formulaic I could have written it, you could have written it, it could have written itself. Heck, it’s so predictable it could have also directed itself."
fresh,"Sometimes you just want to watch something feel-good, which is where Champions scores."
rotten,"Harrelson is enjoyable as always, and the rest of the cast delivers, but the film is too warm, fuzzy, predictable, and by the numbers to be anything more than a pleasant diversion"
rotten,[D]irector Bobby Farrelly's movie does a little more than the bare minimum when it comes to its characters with disabilities.
rotten,The film’s narrative arc is as calculated and predictable as a ball in flight. Even a heart-warming story can leave you cold if it’s poorly told.
fresh,Audiences need accessible and entertaining movies like this.
rotten,Perfectly forgettable sports comedy fare.
rotten,"The dispiriting experience of watching “Champions” is slowly realizing that, notwithstanding an off-color line here or there, it’s exactly the sort of formulaic crowd-pleaser that just about anybody might have directed."
fresh,"In its specificity, Champions becomes an open-hearted, universal tale of the power of respect and acceptance. And fart and barf gags because, after all, this was made by a Farrelly brother."
fresh,There isn’t a surprise in the movie except for how enjoyable it is.
rotten,"Too obviously intended as an aspirational, uplifting and inspiring against-the-odds story, Champions, well-meaning to a fault, is carpeted with sentimental clichés and cardboard charm. And, frankly, it ain’t very funny."
fresh,"Respectfully highlights a wonderful group of basketball-loving young adults who happen to have intellectual disabilities and how they teach an embattled coach to be a better man, with a sweet (and a little racy) bit of rom-com on the side."
rotten,"It’s difficult to get excited about “Champions,” which doesn’t stray from formula and doesn’t feel particularly endearing, getting by on soft humor and paint-by-numbers screenwriting."
fresh,Farrelly does a great job balancing the comedy and the more dramatic aspects of the story to make this quite an enjoyable and even inspirational overall film.
fresh,In a very modest way this goofball minor-league basketball yarn throws off enough amiable and vaguely raucous charm to keep a smile on sports fans’ faces much of time.
rotten,"A film that lands in an uncomfortable space between understanding and mockery. Like its grouchy hero, it wants to be applauded for its tolerance, while also mining laughs out its characters’ differences."
fresh,"Champions runs on too long, but its shaggy, rambling style can’t help but win you over as it progresses."
rotten,"A bland, clunky, tonally uneven and painfully unfunny misfire."
fresh,"Champions rises, becoming more than a clichéd tale full of heart. It reveals common misconceptions about people with intellectual disabilities, all with an enticing sports tale."
rotten,[Uses] its team of Disabled basketball players solely as a method towards [the coach's] redemption while completely failing to see their humanity.
fresh,"Charming and respectable, but more than a tad cliched, director Bobby Farrelly’s basketball dramedy Champions coasts along nicely thanks to its air of general likability and some well drawn characters."
fresh,"If you must see a feel-good sports film comedy, you might as well see this one--you won't break out in a rash over it."
fresh,"This big-hearted underdog sports comedy runs on rails, with no great surprises, but it’s likable."
fresh,"Harrelson shines as a man learning that there’s more to life than NBA fame, and he has a terrific leading lady in Katilin Olson, as Alex."
rotten,Champions is detestable for its first hour and merely tolerable for its second hour
rotten,"Offsetting its naughtier impulses with feel-good schmaltz, it employs a tired formula to losing results."
fresh,"Farrelly is confident in his direction of the genre, and in sticking to his sensibilities he’s created a warm, welcoming comedy that overcomes its predictable nature."
fresh,"It may not be a slam dunk, but it scores more than enough lay-ups to get on the board."
rotten,A paternalistic and patronizing movie...
fresh,"Champions is definitely celebrating these characters, and the actors who play them. The jokes are at Marcus' expense."
fresh,"There’s a bit of crude humor, but it’s a really heartfelt and feel-good movie that many people will enjoy."
rotten,"A well-meaning crowd-pleaser that does try to encourage us to have a laugh or two at our differences, although the actual humor feels like someone dusted off jokes their grandpa used to really get a kick out of."
fresh,"Champions feels overly familiar. But that doesn’t make this sure-to-be crowd-pleaser any less winning, especially with the endlessly likable Harrelson at its center."
fresh,The entire ensemble of neurodivergent and differently-abled actors shines brighter than any of the other cast members.
rotten,[It] might have felt enlightened 25 years ago — back when “Forrest Gump” was an Oscar favorite — but today makes for a patronizing portrayal of people with intellectual disabilities.
fresh,"“Champions” gets by on good nature. It has the good nature of its story and its intentions, which count for something, as well as the good nature of Harrelson, which counts for a lot."
rotten,"Champions is mostly cringeworthy comedy about a grouchy coach and his basketball players, who aspire to compete in the Special Olympics. This misguided movie is an awkward mixture of sappiness, crudeness, bad jokes, and negative stereotypes."
rotten,One of the most notable issues with Johnson as an actor is his constant mugging for the camera.
fresh,"Dwayne Johnson saves the day, despite some hiccups."
rotten,"Black Adam is clearly a major passion project for the Rock, and he clearly wanted to go for something of a more dramatic role, but it doesn't always feel like the film is making the best use of his talents."
fresh,"The cast’s chemistry and running jokes help rescue an otherwise formulaic action film. Brosnan’s elegant performance stands out, and the post-credits scene will leave moviegoers begging for a sequel."
rotten,"Tiresomely heavy exposition, story with little to no creativity, and inconsistent humor make it impossible for the DCEU to take ""the next step"" in a truly impactful manner."
fresh,A misunderstood epic kick off to the next era of the DC UNIVERSE. Visceral & Intense action scenes create such a kinetic time that I loved. @TheRock completely became Black Adam & added much needed mythology to the word SHAZAM.
rotten,"Black Adam is an action-driven film that knows it is in service of the fans, which means plenty of spectacle and a focus on entertainment with a capital E, for better and worse."
fresh,Black Adam compensates for the copious amounts of expository dialogue with copious amounts of action and spectacle. Dwayne Johnson’s entry as the titular character is fantastic. There’s visual comedy. It is quite barbaric.
rotten,Sabbac's late-stage introduction in Black Adam does not justify the ill timing of his arrival. It only strains an already-thin plot.
fresh,"It is NOT all doom and gloom, thankfully. It has a tongue placed firmly in its cheek and a sly sense of humor, never allowing the movie to get too light or dark; just the right amount of entertainment and humor. The Rock gets to let loose."
rotten,"I thought it was enjoyable and a different take on the superhero genre. But given everything happening in DC with James Gunn, this story is pretty much irrelevant."
rotten,"This is my least favorite superhero movie in recent memory. I'm hoping ""The Rock"" will choose projects that truly challenge him as an actor and that go beyond cliche action set pieces and poor character development."
rotten,"Maybe there was a coherent film being developed at some point, but those days are long gone."
rotten,"While DC might have produced the best superhero saga of 2022 with The Batman (take that, Marvel!), it was also responsible for the worst with Black Adam (take that, DC!)."
fresh,"Big, loud, and full of energy. Absolutely nothing that you're going to remember after a couple of days, but it does go down easy and is very watchable."
fresh,"To do both characters of Shazam and Black Adam justice, they needed their own separate films with separate tones. We finally have that Black Adam movie, which is just as brutal and action packed as the Rock has always promised. ... I had a blast."
fresh,"It is obvious why Johnson was cast in the title role. He is a HUGE box office draw, can portray an extremely menacing character, and would be believable as an ancient superhero."
rotten,"With its uninspired narrative, paper-thin characters, and an uncharacteristically uncharismatic Dwayne Johnson, Black Adam merely presents yet another DC dud that fails to excite, entertain, or even remotely engage."
rotten,...  it’s so intent on creating literal blockbusting action sequences that all of the good stuff gets lost in the rubble.
rotten,"It’s a slog to sit through, a painfully dull, and lackluster superhero movie that can never decide if its titular character is a superhero or a villain in the making..."
rotten,Even the rock-solid charisma of Dwayne Johnson rolls off a cliff with this noisy and disappointingly boring load of CGI-laden superhero tosh. A DCU fail.
rotten,"Without critical support or audience support, Johnson will approach a crossroads. He can continue to sleepwalk through blockbusters, and they will continue to feel like empty calories. Or he can work with directors who will challenge him."
fresh,It never tries to be more than it is: the origin tale of a superentity that toes the line. Not because he might be evil. Because good isn't always enough to defeat evil alone.
rotten,"Black Adam also features the same issue as Captain Marvel, introducing an impossibly invincible superhero with no emotion and is hard to connect to."
rotten,"For all the big fights, glowing CGI and mean mugging the Rock can do, this film is startlingly lifeless for having been in the works for so long."
rotten,"Somewhere in among the fringes of this overplotted, overpopulated mess is a moral wrestling match in which self-proclaimed heroes who just want to stop a guy from killing – extrajudicially..."
rotten,"There are plenty of shortcomings to be found in Black Adam, then, but Johnson is never one of them, with his underrated acting chops compensating for the deliberate reigning in of his boundless charisma."
rotten,"Because Black Adam is such an angry anti-hero, Johnson’s personality is dialed all the way down to zero. Black Adam could have been a completely animated Vocaloid and we wouldn’t have known the difference."
rotten,"More than anything, Black Adam seems to just set up the future of the DCEU, but I must say, it doesn’t look very good."
rotten,"Culturally deficient, narratively inconsistent and a frustratingly superficial instalment in DC’s cinematic universe."
rotten,"Promises some interesting dynamics concerning anti-imperialism and power dynamics, but  every attempt to tie it to larger plotty banalities of superhero urgencies feels clunky. It's at its best when it ignores any larger DC context."
fresh,"Not quite the superhero film we deserve but it might just be the one we need right now... not a soft reboot, but a hard recalibration for the DCEU."
fresh,"Black Adam has some amazing characters in The Rock's Black Adam, along with JSA members Hawkman & Doctor Fate played by Hodge & Brosnan highlighting every seen they are in. The human element and antagonist are on the weak side sadly bringing down the film"
rotten,"For as expensive as it was to create this film, it certainly could have done much more to not feel so cheap, in more ways than one."
rotten,"Its reluctance to do something dark and inventive with its protagonist makes Black Adam yet another dull, middling chapter in the DCEU."
fresh,"What Black Adam lacks in originality, it makes up for in entertainment value."
rotten,"The Rock didn’t cook up this hot mess but he sure is served up as the main dish. Sloppy CGI effects, overused tropes, and a lack of empathy for any of its characters."
rotten,"What's missing from Jaume Collet-Serra's cacophonous live-action DC cartoon are a coherent story and solid characters - instead, there's just sloppy, senseless, non-stop action."
rotten,"While The Rock over-represents AAPI diversity in films, he represents a miscasting of a hero who should be from the underrepresented MENA population. Also problematic are questionable themes of justifiable violence and poor control of tonal shifts."
rotten,"Dwayne Johnson brings his action film A-game to the table, but a crowded script with too much convoluted exposition and overblown CGI soften what could have been a great film."
rotten,"The conundrum at the heart of Black Adam is how the film manages to render so many likable, charming actors into forgettable clichés"
rotten,Why does garbage like this keep happening?
fresh,Amusing humor and a very entertaining performance from The Rock consolidate Black Adam as one of the strongest DCEU outings.
fresh,"Been there, done that - still it's ""The Rock"" and it's all a lot of fun."
rotten,A mostly intolerable DC comics adaptation...
fresh,"There are specks of greatness within the mid-tier story but this DC flick is more entertaining than the past few MCU features, which is saying a lot."
rotten,"Black Adam has been heralded as a new direction for DC’s film franchise, but the Rock-fronted movie looks a lot like its predecessors—and the DCEU’s direction still isn’t clear."
fresh,"This film is absolutely a blast and should be seen in theaters. Dwayne Johnson has shown that if we wait for him to don the suit, he will deliver. Watch Black Adam on the biggest screen you can!"
fresh,"Johnson is one of the most adept combat actors in Hollywood, it's fitting he has his own movie, although his tireless efforts to project himself as a family guy, a dad, etc., conflicts with the violence of his character."
fresh,"Black Adam is, in a way, a hero for modern times in America, at least for those who want to take the law into their own hands, tear down this country and remake it into something more like Russia or China."
rotten,"Occasionally exploring themes of what it means to be heroic or villainous, with shades of gray in between, this superhero movie collapses into a boring bash-fest with barely any time to breathe."
fresh,"The film might not always hit the right notes, but ultimately it serves its purpose as a solid origin story that has plenty of room for growth and expansion."
fresh,"Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate provides the best performance, looking debonair and put together, even as he struggles to convince Adam that he can become the champion that his people need."
rotten,"Jaume Collet-Serra is a gifted craftsman who deserves much better than this, because his talents are both wasted and buried beneath layers of ugly CGI, an overbearing score, and a story that makes the proverbial dull dishwater look positively vibrant."
rotten,There’s something morally deadening and aesthetically depressing about the bottomless toy chest of C.G.I. being reduced to the toolbox of cinematic bureaucracy.
rotten,"Black Adam is somewhat entertaining, but the movie feels like a missed opportunity. A good film is hiding in this mess somewhere, but director Jaume Collet-Serra just couldn’t find it."
rotten,"No only repeats the apparently insurmountable errors of its predecessor counterparts, but it seems to be built on a pastiche devoid of personality that turns its viewing in a déjà-vu saved in extremis by the laudable dedication of Dwayne Johnson."
rotten,"Suffering from the inability to say no, director Jaume Collet-Serra presides over an excess of ... everything. Too many superheroes, too much plot, an abundance of fighting, of CGI, and in some of his famous cast, an abundance of scenery-chewing."
fresh,A straightforward action. It starts and it doesn't stop.
fresh,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Black Adam is perfect casting."
rotten,"Not a fresh thought to be found, but with enough flash, rattle and roll to maybe entertain the younger fan."
rotten,"Black Adam is mostly a movie made up of strictly baseline ideas, or the regurgitation of already existing ones."
fresh,"Goofy, unpretentious crowd-pleaser mode isn’t exactly a bad look for Black Adam."
rotten,"Black Adam fails to be a memorable, cinematic action film. With haphazard storytelling, increasingly tedious and repetitive action scenes and forgettable characters, the latest DC entry lands with a heavy thud."
fresh,"Black Adam is surprisingly compelling, both as a reactionary statement against the state of superhero cinema with geopolitical ambitions and a fun expression of all of the things it’s railing against."
rotten,"Considering how much has been done with the subgenre in recent years, it makes sense that there are certain expectations towards this type of film, and unfortunately, ""Black Adam"" does not live up to many of them. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,Black Adam is two hours of flying and punching that grounds its likeable cast just long enough for it to be decent blockbuster fun.
fresh,"While DC explores a darker, over-serious side of the comic-book superhero genre, at least that adds an original tone to this action-packed apocalyptic romp."
fresh,"It’s distinguished itself just enough to satiate action film fans, entertain future streaming audiences and warrant further merging into the DC universe."
rotten,"Doppelgangers have always been a staple between the competing comic companies but in this slapped-together entry, the DCU has officially transformed (or transmorphed) into The Asylum video boxes designed to trick viewers they are watching the real thing."
fresh,"Why the vitriol for what it an entertaining comic book movie? It wasn’t perfect, the story is tangled, but it reminded me of those memories when the hero comes around in the last pages of my 25 cent comic in the 1970s. Audience 90 Critics 39. Nuff said."
fresh,"The world-building in the film brings in the justice society and some notable hero names, but its still a bit boiler-plate with the plot. And while I enjoyed Johnson's BA, the character feels like it was written for ego, not for growth."
rotten,The fate of the movies that lie in the near future will rest squarely on what Warner-DC can bring to the mix. That would have to be significantly more than what Black Adam delivers.
rotten,Will there be more Black Adam movies? I don't know but it might be best to say Shazam and hope for the best.
rotten,A muddled mess of a movie.
rotten,"It raises big ideas. Honestly, it would have been a really cool movie if they had done anything with them. [...] Instead they just take the path of least resistance."
rotten,"...about as soulless, empty, and unnecessary a superhero movie as you will ever see."
fresh,Black Adam offers exciting and unique superhero action in a movie that meaningfully questions the black and white morality of most superhero movies.
rotten,Black Adam lacks the spark DC was looking for.
rotten,"I found it to be completely inert and lifeless, especially his character."
rotten,"Clomps through its boilerplate-but-also-convoluted story with stone-faced determination, checking boxes right and left."
rotten,"In spite of being generally a passable film, it's fairly predictable and its narrative devices are constantly perceived. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"This movie is just sort of a lark, and more interesting as [a sign of] where the genre is going."
rotten,"Unfortunately, what heart there is in the film doesn’t come from its main character, and I don’t just mean that he’s not warm and fuzzy -- this is the least entertaining, least appealing role of Johnson’s career."
fresh,"Will critics love it? Absolutely not. But will you love it? If you love big, loud popcorn superhero movies and The Rock? You bet."
fresh,“Black Adam” accomplishes everything it needs to. It offers big action and cracking new characters. It puts its own unique stamp on the superhero origin story. And it sets the DCEU on an exciting new trajectory.
rotten,Should really be called 'Bland Adam'.
rotten,"It is the writing, perhaps, that muddies Black Adam to near obscurity, wiping away any proper establishment of character until all that is left is a meathead magician who can spar with jets of electricity and drop foes from the middle of the ozone layer."
rotten,"Characters and audiences are relentlessly pummeled by lightning bolts, fiery jolts and villainous dolts with such intense abandon that thumbs start subconsciously twitching for a fast forward button."
rotten,Black Adam is nothing more than a splashy two-hour coming attractions reel for future motion pictures.
rotten,"Black Adam is a standard superhero movie, executed sleekly and designed to bring the most bang for your buck. However, despite the best efforts of Johnson, it may be a film that’s only remembered for its explosive mid-credits reveal."
rotten,It's just a shame the film itself is painfully dull.
rotten,"Cheaper, trashier, perhaps even dumber films have been saved by the presence of Dwayne Johnson. So why is DC’s latest so doggedly immune to the redemptive power of the Rock?"
rotten,"The biggest warning sign that DC is running out of any storytelling steam arrives with one big crash in “Black Adam,” which is another CGI-heavy punchathon lacking any substance."
rotten,"Underwhelming big-budget action superhero B film, using the DC Comics characters."
rotten,"With a horrid script, lackluster performances, and a waste of potentially awesome characters, Black Adam is an explosive, $195 million, anti-heroic dud."
fresh,"I can’t say whether the hierarchy of power in the DC universe has changed or not, but I can say Black Adam delivers just enough to be on the right side of entertaining. Just."
rotten,"A needlessly dark pile of steaming genre trash that takes itself way more seriously than it should, Black Adam is still pretty entertaining in parts."
fresh,"Flashy and fun at times, but overly reliant on its star and a cohesive vision for the DCEU that it neither projects nor even exists at this point, Black Adam offers mountains of potential without much payoff."
rotten,Black Adam squanders the DCEU’s meatiest moral quandary with an atrocious script hellbent on saying absolutely nothing interesting about its narrative or stacked roster of characters. It’s quite astonishing how boring this movie really is.
rotten,"An unpleasant, cacophonous barrage of symbols and sounds. It adds up to little more than a two-hour montage of action and comedy concepts divorced from rhythm, or comprehensibility, or real humanity. The Rock used to be fun—but this is no fun at all."
rotten,A paint by numbers superhero film that refuses to actually embrace the moral ambiguity of the original character. Not wildly offensive but unfortunately not particularly entertaining. Had this come out 10 years ago perhaps it wouldn't feel so anemic.
rotten,"Sure it’s been done and been done better, but it’s been a while since The Dark Knight."
rotten,Black Adam kneels to the idea that slipping Johnson into a sprawling superhero franchise means robbing the wrestler-turned-actor himself of any on-screen personality.
rotten,"The writing is just so much connect-the-dots to get us from one overwrought battle sequence to the next, and too many of those dots were skipped."
rotten,Black Adam is what happens when artists say they want to go dark but don't really have the stomach for it.
rotten,"Black Adam wants to be the film that “rights” the DCEU, but it’s just another messy, shallow entry into a sloppy canon that won’t commit to real ideas."
rotten,"Dwayne Johnson is missing in action. Not technically, or even physically. But certainly in the only way that really matters – his heretofore irrepressible charisma. Because in Black Adam, it has been repressed. Not just repressed, but absent."
rotten,Dwayne Johnson is at his most uninteresting as an ancient Egyptian bodybuilder who must learn (like Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy) that sarcasm is cool and that (like Arnie in Terminator 2) torture and murder is not.
fresh,"DC's latest effort, Black Adam, avoids making screenplay decisions and choosing its own style, and bets on spectacular, yet a thousand-times seen, action sequences. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It delivers all the action you'd expect from a superhero picture, yet possesses a more easygoing tone that invites you to laugh at the comedic moments and enjoy the crazy places the plot goes to."
fresh,The Rock showed up delivering the perfect amount of energy to bring this new franchise life.
fresh,"Black Adam is a one-time-watch, especially for Dwayne Johnson and the jaw-dropping visuals and action sequences."
rotten,"Dwayne wants to see himself as a vigilante superhero with Godlike powers. So now I have to review “Black Adam,” which is two hours of noise and lights vaguely in the shape of a movie."
rotten,"You can hear the ideal version of this film screaming for help at certain points, mainly from the cast who do such a phenomenal job at keeping it entertaining, all whilst the flimsy script and choppy editing does them no favours."
fresh,"Carves itself a genuine opportunity to be the anti-Marvel, to its credit, but then goes on to squander that opportunity so badly that it ends up feeling more like a poor man's Marvel instead."
fresh,Electrifying visuals and epic action fuel a dynamic and crowd-pleasing blockbuster. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,The film ultimately overloads us with so much amazing nonsense that we sort of give up and give in.
fresh,"It's an enjoyable enough of a superhero battler, but frustrating in that it actually has things to say under it's cape, but constantly flies away anytime it gets close to being meaningful."
rotten,Tepid. Lukewarm. Mediocre. Bland. Sluggish. Perfunctory. Dull. Anemic.
rotten,"Ghost yourself from this Chris Evans, Ana de Armas fever dream..."
rotten,A lot of predictable action...
rotten,"Like most contemporary blockbusters, Fletcher and co. plant the seeds for a potential sequel if the movie turns out to be a hit for Apple TV+. But I doubt too many people would be upset if we never heard from “Ghosted” again."
rotten,It’s a pity how monotonous Ghosted ends up feeling considering the zest of it’s set-up.
rotten,"The action sequences in ""Ghosted"" are well crafted by Fletcher, even if the climax itself is a flashy comedy of errors."
fresh,"This is the kinda of movie, you sit on the couch, it's Saturday afternoon, you don't want to think too hard, you think why not? ...A decent movie, not the worst, not the best, but just fun mindless entertainment."
fresh,"Comfortably cartoonish, funnier than expected and even kinda cute."
rotten,"Ghosted is a tremendous catastrophe. When the only memorable moments of the entire film are the myriad cameos totally disconnected from the story itself, little else can be said about it. Very far from the ""so bad it’s good"" status."
rotten,"It tries too hard at some points and feels overly comical at others, but eh, Chris Evans, as a precious himbo farmer who knows way too much about plants, is still a win for the romance enthusiasts."
rotten,It's a remarkable feat to watch a screenplay suck all the potential chemistry out of two beautiful people. Because that's all that's left in this blindingly stupid wannabe action comedy asking us to root for these sad souls & their relationship struggles.
rotten,"Ghosted is not a movie anyone would pay to see in a theater, conveniently, it’s streaming at home, where the stakes for mediocrity are much lower."
rotten,Part of me feels like I should celebrate non-IP attempts at mature actioners--but the rest of me feels like I'd rather be watching something that doesn't suck. It's the eternal struggle.
rotten,"Evans and de Armas are very appealing performers, and the action isn't bad, but this is a mostly witless action romcom."
rotten,"Big-budget, glossy, empty and soulless."
rotten,A madcap adventure that sucked.
fresh,"Ghosted never tries to be too serious and instead leans into the jokes, which allows the movie to have an equal balance of action and comedy."
fresh,"Written by a team of four men with action-adventure credits, thwarting evil dudes becomes more of a sprawling and chaotic contrived spectacle. However, high-concept rom-coms are all about the chemistry and less about intrigue."
rotten,On screen chemistry is a funny thing. It is either there or it isn't. De Armas and Evans don't have it.
rotten,"It just isn’t as fun, as consistently entertaining, as it should be given all it has going for it."
rotten,"Cole is aggrieved that Sadie lied about her profession. “Unbelievable,” he eye-rolls. Sadie is annoyed at having to repeatedly rescue Cole. “Unbelievable,” she fumes. Such is how the movie wastes the smoking-hot pair. Unbelievable."
rotten,"The potential for a fun and funny action rom-com, giving its high-caliber talent, never materializes. Not even the best spy could walk away unscathed from this trainwreck. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,Ghosted is pretty much like every other copycat riff that’s been spun since that 1994 film...
rotten,Fletcher’s film... isn’t really a throwback to the summer movies of the 2000s so much as Apple TV+’s foray into an emergent genre best described as “Netflix drivel.”
fresh,"Not brilliant, but it honestly is still fun with a somewhat refreshing swap of typical action gender roles."
rotten,"There’s absolutely nothing about this film that feels new and fresh, which in itself is not egregious, but when you aren’t doing anything new, you should at least do something well."
rotten,"Despite some stylish visuals in exotic locales, as the film becomes progressively more far-fetched, you begin to wish it had ghosted you instead."
rotten,"Ghosted really does feel like a product being put on display. It has popular stars pushed together by a terrible premise and every effort to do something fun is thwarted by half-hearted direction, poor writing, and a lack of spark between the famous faces"
rotten,This hokey headscratcher tries to ride on the star wattage of its handsome two leads and host of fun supporting players. It turns out they aren’t enough to keep this maddeningly bland misfire from succumbing to its own lack of originality or imagination.
rotten,Director Dexter Fletcher never quite feels in control of this film’s crazier elements and doesn’t quite manage to make the most of his two stars’ combined potential.
rotten,"Sadly, Ghosted fares no better as an action-adventure film than it does as a romantic comedy."
rotten,"Ghosted is supposed to be light, breezy fun, but settles for being leadenly dull."
fresh,If only the (four) writers had saved more time for talk and less for the Bond-èsque villains (Brody with a French accent) and protracted fight-and-chase sequences.
rotten,"Aside from the gaping chasm where the chemistry between the leads should be, Ghosted fails in just about every other metric of filmmaking too."
fresh,"While the mix of outrageous action mayhem and sweet romance isn't always convincing, this is a thoroughly entertaining bit of nonsense."
rotten,There are lessons to be learned here; don’t cast a guy best known for playing a literal superhero as a hapless Average Joe and perhaps screen test your stars to ensure they can sell a romance on screen.
rotten,"Ghosted relies on these two talented performers to deliver, even when the dialogue and action sequences are mediocre at best. The chemistry never fully feels believable, and the plot is generic."
fresh,It’s a film that encourages you to sit back and enjoy the familiarity of its set-up and revel in the unpretentiousness of a film that only exists to entertain for a couple of hours.
rotten,"If that’s the case, maybe one of those four writers should have worked harder on character development. Since that clearly didn’t happen, this is what we’re left with. Enjoy the cameos!"
rotten,"Ghosted isn’t a tragic action rom-com misfire, but being “fine at best” outside of cameos from Chris Evans’ and Ana de Armas’ friends is the most excitement it’s usually able to muster."
fresh,"Ghosted is like a hurricane of car and truck chases, shootouts, explosions, and hand-to-hand combat. If, at times, it's unbelievable, it is always entertaining. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"After a point, it starts to feel like Ghosted is trying to brainwash its audience. There is no chemistry, sexual or otherwise."
rotten,"Despite a lot of great ingredients in the cocktail shaker, there's no amount of booze that can save Ghosted."
rotten,"One big clunker of a film. Generic, bland and at times cringe, not even some cool action and funny cameos can help it. Oh, and the chemistry between the leads is nonexistent. Really disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Ghosted can't figure out how to make its individually likable leads work as a couple. Opposites attract and love blooms while bullets fly. Sounds good on paper, but there needs to be a tangible connection tying the mismatched pair together."
fresh,"It’s an easy evening’s entertainment, a casual brain-relaxer that doesn’t require anything out of the audience except complete intellectual remove and a thorough willingness to set reality aside for a couple of hours."
rotten,"This was the leftover scraps cobbled together from better scripts. It’s the movie equivalent of bubble-and-squeak, and in their heart of hearts, no one ever wants bubble-and-squeak."
rotten,Ghosted is a bad movie that’s a listless and sterile experience. The chemistry between the leads takes a back seat to unreasonably excessive villains and stale comedy styling.
rotten,"When even its leads have little chemistry to speak of & the romantic comedy aspect is barely explored, the film isn’t worth your time."
rotten,"The leads are attractive but the script is contrived, the banter forced, and the action rote in Dexter Fletcher’s mash-up of rom-com and spy caper."
rotten,Ghosted burns through its talent and never rises above mediocrity.
rotten,Ghosted is reminiscent of a generic product straight out of the assembly line.
rotten,"Unfortunately, a stacked cast, an original premise, and all the celebrity cameos in the world cannot save this film from itself."
rotten,"It's lazy, simply trying to coast along by star power casting alone, with no self-awareness that the characters quickly become irritating"
rotten,"Genre mash-ups can sometimes work, but not when handled as leadenly as is done here."
rotten,It simply does not work.
rotten,It often feels like Ghosted is throwing everything it can at the wall and hoping at least one thing will stick.
rotten,An atrocious film.
fresh,GHOSTED is the Uncharted-style romantic comedy I didn't know I needed. Ana de Armas and Evans have perfect chemistry and shine in the kind of bombastic set pieces that make for a fun spy-focused action-adventure movie experience.
rotten,"Despite the big stunts and the charisma of Chris Evans and Ana de Armas, Ghosted offers little we haven’t seen before."
rotten,"This movie is annoying and loud and definitely needs to get a room, and be locked from the outside with furniture piled against the door."
rotten,Ghosted is just happy to evoke the concept of entertainment in the hopes that some pretty faces and a familiar arrangement of flashing lights might be enough to convince the stock market that Apple is investing its money rather than [wasting it].
rotten,"It's very pretty, badly written and entirely lacking in chemistry."
fresh,"A spirited if familiar action-based romantic comedy, where the sparring banter generally outshines the muscular stunts. Throw in clever cameos and this Apple TV+ movie delivers on its promise of unpretentious fun."
rotten,"It’s readily apparent that de Armas and Evans, charismatic and charming on their own, have next to no chemistry. Every line delivery is so stilted it’s as though they’re being read off cue-cards, a la SNL."
rotten,"The action is plentiful, but not particularly well-executed, and neither Mr. Evans nor Ms. Armas is really a comedian."
rotten,All you might get from this movie [is] a little pick-me-up before you ghost it forever.
fresh,Check your brains at the door (or in this case on the couch) and you will have a good enough time thanks to Evans and de Armas.
rotten,That it comes from Rocketman director Dexter Fletcher and Deadpool and Zombieland screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick is flat-out dismaying; either they didn’t care or they’re losing their abilities.
fresh,"The romantic comedy is back, baby!"
rotten,"The romantic comedy action hybrid “Ghosted” isn’t a Russo Brothers movie, nor are they remotely involved. Still, it feels like their movie in that, the self-satisfied film radiates like it’s reinventing the wheel, and yet it is equally hollow and generic."
rotten,"So Apple TV+’s Ghosted is in good company, as a combination romantic comedy and action film. It’s just unfortunate that it’s not particularly good at being either one."
rotten,"Ghosted is especially frustrating because it's so close to working. Instead, each scene feels as desperate to connect as Cole is to get a date."
rotten,A love story with no chemistry.
fresh,"It's a fun movie overall, worth watching at least once for the laughs and action."
fresh,The whole enterprise is as far-fetched as they come as it amusingly plies the belief that love can conquer all — even world domination.
fresh,There are worse things in life than spending a few hours in the company of appealing performers as they play out some of the classic romantic-comedy patterns.
fresh,"With solid villains, good action, and some classic cameos, Ghosted is a decent couple of hours at the movies."
rotten,"Ultimately, it should be satisfying that these two people learned their lessons through rather highly stressful ordeals. Instead, the varying gags and prolonged bickering make Ghosted feel like thinly veiled couples therapy than love connection."
rotten,"Despite the A-list casting, Ghosted painfully bland, failing to deliver any laughs or make us care about the central romance."
rotten,"Chris Evans and Ana de Armas have absolutely no chemistry, making the love portion of the story completely unbelievable and straight up awkward."
rotten,"Their incessant “comedic” bickering might not amount to much ... or include a single memorable line of dialogue, but at least Evans and de Armas’s on-screen chemistry helps overcome a multitude of dead spots in the otherwise underwhelming script."
rotten,"A tedious exercise in sheer greed and laziness that presumes if enough money and famous faces are tossed into the mix, no one will notice."
rotten,"Ghosted Head-spinning, not quite cooked satire is confirmed by a sudden rotating sky-high restaurant appearance of a beloved star. Loaded with cameos and 110% tongue-in-cheek"
rotten,What's most annoying is that Ghosted doesn't know what to do with Evans.
fresh,"Some parts may be a little cringey, but is cute cringey a thing?"
fresh,"The fast and furious action is a bit plasticky, but the two starry leads bring some real sparks."
rotten,"Although it boasts two of the hottest stars in Hollywood today and a ton of talent behind the camera, Ghosted is little more than some of the most expensive background noise ever created."
fresh,The plot becomes secondary to [Evans and de Armas'] dynamic. This is both a testament to them as performers and evidence that the plot leaves a lot to be desired.
rotten,"The problem is that [de Armas and Evans] have very little chemistry outside of musical montages...This might be forgivable if the other jokes or the action or the narrative picked up the slack, but Ghosted is thoroughly mediocre in nearly every respect."
rotten,"Boring, a little entitled, and staggeringly unintelligent, Ghosted positively pushes you to stop engaging midway, and never think about it ever again."
fresh,"There are enough laughs and fun action scenes to warrant a recommendation, just don't expect much more from it."
fresh,By the time it starts getting really silly —about 25 minutes in — you might feel invested enough... to keep watching. I did.
rotten,"If you’re going to take a hugely familiar premise and rely on easy star chemistry to sell it, you really need the right stars in the right roles and a killer script for all the killing. Sadly this ain’t quite it."
rotten,"Four writers worked on “Ghosted,” and it shows. The movie’s laminated: a layer of romance, a layer of comedy, a layer of action, all squashed together, like plywood."
fresh,"Works best when it doesn’t take itself too seriously. By the time we get to the “protecting the people you love is never a mistake” sentiments, much of the fun of watching Captain America play against type and de Armas in full-on action mode has wilted."
rotten,"For better examples of sexual chemistry in similar movies see Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Mr and Mrs Smith, the entire cast of the first Expendables, and even Arnold Schwarzenegger and his Harley-Davidson in Terminator 2: Judgment Day."
rotten,"A romantic action comedy that starts off light and breezy but turns, before you know it, into a dead-weight spectacle of wretched excess."
fresh,"The movie is pacy popcorn entertainment with deluxe leads. It goes down painlessly, even if you’ll likely forget it the minute it’s over."
rotten,"A staggeringly, maddeningly atrocious heap of increasingly boneheaded decisions that will act as depressing documentation of just how rotten things got in the current oversaturated streaming landscape."
rotten,“Ghosted” is repellent without ever quite being obnoxious and worthless without ever being boring.
rotten,"This tedious, unfunny, screamingly unoriginal romantic adventure film is so flimsy and so insubstantial that it’s practically vaporous."
rotten,"Ghosted ends up being a waste of Chris Evans and Ana de Armas' talents which, despite some fleeting moments, you'll probably ghost yourself after watching."
rotten,Ghosted is a breezy enough action/comedy/romance mix that manages to waste Ana de Armas and Chris Evans.
fresh,"It does what is required but doesn’t strive to go beyond that. When you have actors at the top of their stardom, don’t you want them to be in something that’s more than just ok?"
fresh,"A pleasantly amusing piece of cheese, embraceable for the breezy time-killer it is."
fresh,"It’s all very derivative and silly, but the humor and surprise cameos give “Ghosted” a spark."
rotten,"Recently, actor Chris Evans detailed his reluctance to host “Saturday Night Live,” stating that he’s “not a funny person.” Perhaps it’s time to start believing what Evans says."
rotten,The kind of empty Hollywood product that makes you wonder whether screenwriters are already using artificial intelligence to write their scripts.
rotten,[H]alf of this movie's power couple of stars is miscast.
rotten,"Ghosted ... is flat, lazily written, and instantly forgettable. I wish I too could’ve stepped away like one of those big-name cameos. Quick, abrupt, and gone before you know it."
rotten,"Reviving the big-star caper is a great idea. Someday, someone should try doing it well."
rotten,"Ghosted aims for Romancing the Stone or True Lies, but what it lands on is the grating shallowness of miserable failure."
fresh,Ghosted is elevated by the chemistry between Chris Evans and Ana de Armas as they are always fun to watch and might very well become this generation's Tracy and Hepburn.
rotten,Ghost this movie.
rotten,"It feels like ChatGPT wrote it, and the fact that it didn’t is all the more damning for those who did."
fresh,"Part spy-thriller and all rom-com, Ghosted isn’t good, but its leads make a good time."
rotten,"The script tries to trick viewers into believing that Evans and de Armas are an ideal match by having other characters constantly tell them to ""get a room,"" but like almost everything that makes up the movie, it's unsuccessful in its attempt."
rotten,Ghosted is an action-packed romcom with all the entertainment value of a corporate merger.
rotten,There have been far more compelling metaphors for the trials of adolescence.
rotten,"This slick-looking, but shallow slice of sci-fi features a certain amount of Harry Potter-esque HufflePuff..."
fresh,"Divergent is Hunger Games light, but Woodley and James bring some heat to the leads and it's fun watching Kate Winslet sneering her way through a villainous role."
rotten,"Falling victim to the same problem of many science-fiction or fantasy epic startups, the story is 90% introduction."
rotten,It doesn't help that the music by Junkie XL is overwrought and dominating in the worst of ways.
rotten,"Despite a good lead performance, what we have is a glossy shell but not much underneath."
rotten,It is glaringly obvious that the movie version of Divergent is influenced by the success and popularity of The Hunger Games and sadly this underwhelming film did not deliver.
rotten,"Bland, clunky, and lifeless."
rotten,I was bored.
rotten,"It's like Hunger Games, meets Enders' Game, meets every YA book you've ever read."
fresh,"Divergent suffers in comparison to Hunger Games. But when judged alone, Divergent makes a strong case for the entertainment value of an empowered young female hero attempting to survive and resist in a dystopian society."
rotten,A possibly compelling idea gets lost in the mire of trying to be appealing to a core audience that doesn't want to work hard for narrative reward.
rotten,"The film is more interesting than the average bad movie precisely because it so gratuitously, and even thematically, fails to fit together."
fresh,"This is a rite-of-passage film, with action, romance and self-realization woven in. But unlike some others of this genre, Divergent is thought-provoking teen sci-fi."
rotten,"Saved by Woodley and James' performances, Divergent has every trope a teenage fan could ask for, and not much else."
rotten,"Divergent is chock-full of holes, but Woodley and her bright band of co-stars try valiantly to save the day."
rotten,The story is told in a much too clinical fashion.
fresh,"Divergent doesn't have the same mass appeal, but it doesn't make it any less impactful than the best that this genre - the science fiction genre, not the young adult subgenre - has to offer."
rotten,"While I can't recommend ""Divergent"" to anyone not already fans of the novels, I will say I'm interested in where this series goes."
fresh,Woodley makes things believable... and she and James sell their understated relationship.
fresh,"Woodley plays her part so believably you can't help but root for her despite the juvenile, it's-okay-to-be-different, people-aren't-just-one-thing thematic undertones so simply expressed for the training bra set."
rotten,"Divergent wishes it had nearly the imagination, creativity and angst-ridden scope as its obvious competitor in Games. Let the vicious vixens Beatrice Prior and Katniss Everdeen duke it out until another dueling dollface comes along to settle the score"
fresh,"Divergent is one of the few film adaptations that improves upon its source material. That's not to say that Divergent is a great film, but it's definitely a solid, often thrilling adaptation of a weakly written book."
rotten,All I saw was an overly complicated riff on every YA story cliché.
fresh,"An intriguing premise, sharp casting and thoughtful world-building make ""Divergent"" an engrossing science-fiction adventure."
rotten,"It's better than Twilight...When this movie DOES something, it's actually intriguing."
rotten,... the drama it represents is often bland.[Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Divergent may not be the most popular thrill in the theme park, but it could have been a lot worse, and you'll probably be up for a second spin."
fresh,At the heart of this dystopian tale awash in grays and browns is a lesson about finding one's identity and being at peace with oneself.
fresh,"[Divergent] does a lot right, with slick visuals, an interesting premise and top cast delivering moments when this fantasy thriller is just that, thrilling, although it's hard to shake the impression this is a second-rate Hunger Games."
rotten,"... Divergent, despite multiple claims otherwise, tries to capture the format of The Hunger Games but completely phones in almost each element."
rotten,[Divergent] is faithful enough to the book -- but doesn't work well unto itself.
rotten,The journey is not powerful enough. It loses track and seems purposeless soon enough.
fresh,This is a movie a girl could see with her mom and a big ol' pretzel on a rainy day.
fresh,"Trust me when I say that, for some reason, stick with the saga in the event that the sequels will all materialise, because the ultimate pay off when you discover what it's all for will be definitely worth it."
fresh,"The pic's charismatic cast turns the skeletal narrative into something functional, making for a surprisingly pleasant ride."
fresh,"It may be totally predictable and just a tad overlong and overdone, but Divergent is a far better foray into YA territory than Vampire Academy, or even The Host."
rotten,"Rather than concentrate on environment and character development, it spends two-thirds of its runtime forgetting it needs an ending."
rotten,"It's really just an elaborate metaphor for Being Your Own Beautiful Self, which apparently goes over well with readers of a certain tender age."
rotten,"... a journey that puts (Tris), her family, and the entire 23rd century in danger before Buck Rogers can get back to save it."
rotten,Divergent takes its time in setting up the story and -- frankly -- future installments in the series.
rotten,Divergent is a banal experience that suffers from a stretched-out plot and uninteresting characters.
rotten,"For this first film at least, much of the fantastical elements feels as much like window dressing as the post-apocalyptic material in After Earth."
fresh,"It's not at all as intelligent as it thinks it is, but it's a pretty solid epic all things considered."
fresh,"Tris is no Katniss Everdeen, and Divergent is a better film for not trying to impersonate a similar trilogy. It won't excite the world to the extent of The Hunger Games but this more humble offering is nevertheless exciting, fun and satisfying."
rotten,"This dystopia flick offers a pseudo-allegory for teenagehood along with a predictable plot, bland setting, and pat romance. So it conforms to today's alt-world teen-film formula."
fresh,A far more interesting plot lurks in the background ... It's this - not the mawkish romance - that leads to a fairly exciting climax and sets the stage for a more intriguing premise in the two additional movies that already are in the works ...
fresh,"Dramatically, Divergent wanders, but over rich philosophical soil."
fresh,A relatively faithful adaptation that brings with it the best and the worst parts of the novel and leaves out a few things that might have made it better.
rotten,"Although 'Divergent' has understandably attracted a great readership, as did its predecessor, 'The Hunger Games' series, this new 'young adult' tale has a much weaker presence on the big screen"
rotten,"If the 'Hunger Games' films do a fairly tidy job of explaining their premise, 'Divergent' has to over and over for nearly 2 1/2 hours."
rotten,...just another bloated adaptation that's unable to capture the magic of its literary forebear.
fresh,All the flashy digital bells and whistles one would equate with such a scenario are kept at a startling minimum--but such a back-to-basics approach thus forces one to pay attention to the actual substance of the story and characters.
fresh,"No, it's not wildly different than other science fiction, hero's journey, and adventure movies. Sometimes we call such stories archetypal. Mythic, even."
fresh,"Overall, this is a solid first-up effort for the Divergent franchise. Even though the film loses momentum in its final act as it sets up shop for next year's sequel, a majority of fans will be perfectly content with what has been achieved here."
rotten,Yet another slice of post-content sci-fi schlock that relies on audiences over-looking huge story holes and a grand lack of pace in favour of design and a hot young cast...lame-brained.
rotten,"If I had to join a faction, I'd be looking for one called Bafflement or Exasperation. After spending the best part of five hours watching Divergent and Only Lovers Left Alive, I understand why audiences are flocking to see the Muppets and The Lego Movie."
fresh,"Science fiction it may be, but the essence of the film is that timeless adolescent conundrum: who am I?"
rotten,"Woodley's performance is proof, if proof were needed, that only Jennifer Lawrence can do 'blank-faced teen' compellingly."
rotten,"Really the film is so intent on setting things up for, presumably, subsequent films that it forgets to be entertaining and involving in its own right, I think, and so I found this going over my head. I wasn't really interested in all of this."
fresh,The director was Neil Burger who handles the action with aplomb.
rotten,"The conflicts inherent in old-fashioned high school movies are accommodated, with bullying to stir the blood and romance to set the heart thumping. But Divergent's assimilation of all this fails to excite."
fresh,Romance and self-realisation wrapped in violence now sell a whole lot of tickets. At least Divergent has more to ponder than most of the field.
rotten,It's all very Hunger Games Lite.
fresh,"If one can push past the fact that its world feels a little too familiar, this is a deftly executed slice of teen sci-fi."
fresh,"Filmmaker Neil Burger is more interested in whizzy visuals and a thorny plot to pay much attention to the characters or larger underlying themes, which leaves the film feeling eerily superficial."
rotten,A brutal slog of a movie ...
rotten,"Drab production design (bombed-out buildings and Blake's 7 costumes) aims for gloomy portent, but the grit feels as fake as the fashionable tattoos."
rotten,"For a tale that trumpets the virtues of non-conformity, teen fantasy adventure Divergent proves disappointingly content to follow the pack."
rotten,Another big yawn from the young adult stable
rotten,Veronica Roth loyalists may be delighted. Most everyone else will be aching for the credits.
rotten,"This is a slickly made, energetic teen sci-fi yarn, let down by its derivative and schematic storyline."
fresh,"An often entertaining, and sometimes very interesting, piece of teen SF."
fresh,"Even if the visuals are rather drab and the action more brisk than imaginative, there's enough menace and suspense to create an entertaining diversion."
fresh,"In its sledgehammer metaphoring and scrappy, eager-to-please charm, it's easy to warm to this latest fantasy teen adaptation."
fresh,Those with a high tolerance for blockbusters in which non-fetishised females save the day will be able to put up with its flaws - including lacklustre action sequences and a preoccupation with tattoos.
fresh,"Totalitarianism versus the individual is the basic concept of Divergent, a thrilling sci-fi adventure that is every bit as good as The Hunger Games with a dash of The Matrix added for good measure"
rotten,"Divergent is aimed squarely at the kind of audience who will already have watched The Hunger Games films, and the comparison does it no favours."
rotten,"So many derivative elements don't make it a terrible movie, but merely shoulder-shrugging predictable."
rotten,What a conformist message.
fresh,"The blend of action, romance and political plotting is handled with smooth efficiency by director Neil Burger and Tris is an appealing, if ever so slightly dull heroine."
rotten,"The more you scrutinise the society Roth and these screenwriters have created, the more it seems a chintzily self-designed dystopia whose rules and entire infrastructure are pure cardboard."
rotten,A futuristic challenge romp in the Hunger Games style.
rotten,An exceptional teen girl rises up from the slurry of humanity and goes on to mount a revolution against... you know the drill.
fresh,"The satire is not as sharp as that of The Hunger Games and the training scenes borrow heavily from the much smarter Ender's Game. But it's also stylish, tense and surprisingly pacy."
rotten,"A tangle of under-expressed concepts, stock characters and stock ideas, and pacing misfires."
rotten,Barely diverting.
rotten,It's always disappointing when a film that places so much emphasis on the need to be free-thinking and different from the masses conforms so rigidly to other movies.
fresh,"Smart, tough and a little bit cool, this is an intriguing opening rather than a slam-dunk in its own right, but the cast - and especially Woodley - make it sufficiently diverting to merit a place in the action franchise ranks."
rotten,"At its heart, Divergent is wish fulfillment for teens raised by control freaks."
fresh,"It was a relief to be pleasantly surprised by 'Divergent.' I was not expecting much, based on early reviews, but this is actually a good movie."
rotten,I go sleep now.
rotten,The story is trite and the denouement looks hasty.
rotten,"It's all pretty dumb, and it marks a career low for director Neil Burger, who's made some first-class indie dramas from his own scripts."
rotten,"Nothing more than facile, easily digested teenage wish-fulfillment based on a shaky futurist premise."
fresh,The first impression left by the film is that Woodley's star quality is the main attraction in a storyline that feels too much like a Hunger Games-lite rip-off.
fresh,"With her performance as Tris Prior in Divergent, [Woodley] rescues and then raises up a film that could have been an utter disaster."
fresh,Young adult audiences can SO relate.
rotten,"""Divergent' is too busy warning us about the dangers of conformity to develop a distinctive personality of its own."
rotten,"The first film adapted from Veronica Roth's generically dystopian book series arrives with a sludgy, gray-hued plop."
fresh,"Ultimately, Divergent is a mildly entertaining movie that only succeeds because of its talented cast."
rotten,"Despite being filmed and set in Chicago, Divergent feels like a manufactured product churned out by the Hollywood system."
rotten,"While the movie's not quite accomplished enough to leave us breathlessly awaiting the next chapter (as did the last Hunger Games flick), it also doesn't leave us wanting to avoid the sequel at all costs."
rotten,"The hazy message, that you need to join a club, and only then think independently, is confused, and hardly the cynical dystopian satire of Orwell or Huxley."
rotten,A movie so cold and monotone about its material that it plays more like an emotional concession than a full-fledged adventure.
fresh,"The film is at its most captivating as the laws of the war-scarred world in a futuristic, decimated Chicago are laid out, and the heroine finds out what's in store for her."
rotten,"Yes, kids should embrace individuality, and yes, they should think for themselves. But this thinly veiled metaphor can be rough going sometimes, and the humorless, dumb script asks way too much of its cast."
rotten,'Divergent' is one of those movies that will have you asking question after question - and not getting any answers.
rotten,"Divergent has a few things going for it, but the bulk of its interesting material appears to be on back order."
rotten,"I can't help comparing the movie studios that crank out these young adult fantasies to the evil organizations in the movies themselves, the ones that seek to control young minds and prevent them from thinking freely."
rotten,A painfully dumbed-down version of politics and human nature. It is exactly what you'd expect for a book aimed at 13-year-old kids... targeting the Twilight movie crowd.
fresh,"Given the seemingly endless series of sub-mediocre YA adaptations, we should be thankful for whatever we can get."
rotten,"The climactic chases, shootouts, and fistfights have been staged, filmed, and edited with insobriety. Visual clarity shouldn't be too much to ask from these movies, even if they fail to achieve ideological coherence."
rotten,This late-to-the-YA-dystopia-party look like a meal that's been left out in the sun for a day or so.
fresh,"If there's one area in which Divergent outpaces The Hunger Games by a country mile, it's chemistry."
fresh,"If anything's going to keep this color-by-numbers franchise afloat for that long it'll be Woodley. Her story arc may mirror that of young special heroines that came before her, but she's the most unassuming and relatable of the lot."
fresh,"""Divergent"" has an empathetic heroine, an intriguing premise to keep it afloat, and enough twists to sustain it..."
rotten,"Despite some moments of excitement, the screenplay fails to establish a deeper emotional connection for Tris outside of a casual rooting interest."
rotten,The film offers some distinct pleasures but suffers from an overriding familiarity.
rotten,"Certainly the teenagers who live and breathe these types of serial experiences will be thrilled. But, adults, who don't have a clue, can take a pass."
rotten,David O. Russell’s latest outing is a glibly entertaining caper completely undone by its self-importance.
fresh,"While there has been some criticism about the plot being too busy and trying to say too many things, part of Amsterdam's charm is its ""everything, everywhere, all at once"" vibe."
rotten,"Despite being based in fact, the story ends up being rather bland and the movie becomes more about being a way to spotlight the actors."
rotten,"It's not just the wonky pacing, but that it forever feels like none of it lands the way it's supposed to. It's like a song with a beautifully formed melody played over a rhythm section that can't keep even basic time."
rotten,"While Amsterdam was undoubtedly enjoyable to film for its many costars, the merriment doesn't quite translate to the screen. The plethora of side characters and celebrity cameos becomes confusing for a plot that is already too elaborate."
rotten,"Really dug the friendship element & honestly if it wasn’t for Bale, Robbie, Washington & Joy I probably would have dipped out on the film as the direction/story itself was all held together by strings"
rotten,David O Russell's latest - a shaggy dog mystery with a deliberate air of penny dreadfuls - could do with more straightforward narrative and fewer screwball convolutions
rotten,The down-your-throat optimism at the end of Amsterdam is certainly not the vehicle this film needed for any sort of entertaining climax. I've got plenty of other places to be preached to.
rotten,Amsterdam wastes its immensely talented cast and a hefty budget on an unconvincing script and meandering storytelling.
rotten,A disappointment of epic proportions.
fresh,"Amsterdam presents itself as a work of collaborative trust (thematically, but also formally, but also philosophically) so that discrete sections which threaten to strain credulity on their own, feel woven together with care and thoughtfulness."
fresh,"It’s by no means a perfect movie and has plenty of forgettable moments, but Amsterdam is certainly entertaining and that’s enough for me."
rotten,"Although the production, costume, hair and makeup design are outstanding, the material never rises to the superb level of its all star cast."
rotten,"I wouldn’t have missed the pro-democracy speeches that overwhelm Amsterdam in the end, had they been tacked back, but despite Russell’s strenuous efforts, you actually can’t have everything."
rotten,The nearly impossible narrative is not quick witted let alone charming enough to be in the same vein as Preston Sturges or Ernst Lubitsch.
fresh,"A kooky piece of messy Americana, but it’s enjoyable enough to make you appreciate the cast and craft."
rotten,"It looks beautiful and Daniel Pemberton (""Motherless Brooklyn""/""The Bad Guys"") provides another great score, but it’s all set dressing on a film one never really connects with in a meaning way."
rotten,"By some miracle, wasting your time may be the least of the director’s crimes against humanity."
rotten,"A rather boring film that, behind the curtain of political conspiracies, mixes genres uselessly and seems to be the product of a disjointed assemblage at the service of seedy characters who only spend their time talking nonsense. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"An overstuffed, muddled, historical 1930s fantasy period romantic comedy-thriller that dazzles."
fresh,"Russell spins a madcap saga that doesn’t achieve the blissful absurdity of the Coen Brothers or the gripping intrigue of Hitchcock, but instead concludes on a tender, heartfelt note..."
rotten,A monumental waste of time and talent. One of the worst films of year. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Besides protracted, the film remains too derivative, superficial, and humorless to produce an acceptable outcome."
rotten,"Credit to David O. Russell for trying to make a movie, Amsterdam, that’s unique and compelling. He didn’t really succeed, but at least he tried."
rotten,"It focuses attention on an important historical episode, the effort by elements in the ruling class to organize a coup in 1933–34 against Franklin D. Roosevelt, but severely fails in its treatment of the event as well as its contemporary significance."
rotten,"It takes well over an hour before Amsterdam decides what it wants to be and, by that time, viewers may be exasperated by the film’s quirkiness and exhausted by its meandering, unfocused storyline."
rotten,"Russell has done some great world-building here — as has his crew, in a more literal sense — but he overindulges in that world. Perhaps there’s no one in the allegedly megalomaniacal auteur’s sphere who’s willing to tell him no."
fresh,For those who think more is more... and better. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Everything is senseless. The script, the direction, the mellifluous performances. If this is what North American auteur cinema has to bring, it is doomed. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"... at times exhausting, offers small sparks without quite lighting up the flame of entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"A mixed experience, replete with stellar acting talent, but the moments of lacklustre writing and uncertain direction end on an awkward note"
fresh,"Gives us a beautiful reflection on the value of friendship, love, and patriotism. Its foundation stone brings us closer to principles that we tend to forget in the present: the beauty that lies in the ugly and broken [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,A film in which it is not known if the grotesque is intended or accidental.
rotten,Amsterdam makes a great tourist destination but its promise fades in David O. Russell’s newest movie.
rotten,"Scenes drag on. Characters seem to be in different movies. The film looks terrific because of Judy Becker’s superior production values, but good grief, where are we headed?"
rotten,Many interesting characters get waylaid en route to the point.
rotten,It’s apparent from the early minutes of Amsterdam — a comedic mystery thriller that blends fascinating fact with rather lackluster fiction — that the divisive filmmaker’s latest likely will never come together.
rotten,You search for what's right with this movie and end up with a list of what's not.
rotten,"The cinematic equivalent of an old person telling you a story from their past, and you just nod along for what seems like forever, waiting for it to go somewhere or get interesting."
rotten,...increasingly endless and flat-out incoherent...
fresh,A nimbly executed variety hour.
fresh,Like a sloppy guy at a bar telling a farfetched tale
rotten,"There are at least half a dozen good ideas lurking within Amsterdam, but they all struggle for breathing room. Unleashing all his ideas on the screen results in Russell’s most vibrant film in years, but also his most inconsistent."
rotten,"Russell wants to rightly tackle the rise of fascism in American politics & corporations, but like too many in the media never finds the right tone to keep us engaged in the danger, instead floundering with a weak comedic tone and a lack of proper urgency."
fresh,"Amsterdam transforms a nightmare into a dark comedy -- at times brilliant, at times inarticulate -- greatly benefitted by the notable performances that manage to save the ship from wreckage. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Despite the frenetic, anarchic energy that carries the film along, there is loads of charm."
fresh,"There's little faulting the spirited actors circling around Bale, Washington and Robbie — Malek, Saldana, Riseborough and De Niro especially — or that lead threesome."
rotten,The kind of misfire that only talented people could make.
fresh,"Wildly ambitious and thoroughly complex, this sprawling David O. Russell period piece has a thick, gummy quality as if it were made in a vacuum, yet it's too relevant to entirely dismiss."
rotten,"It's incredibly ambitious, I'll give it that, but it's an absolute mess."
rotten,Hollywood's sickening obsession with fascism has found a new victim in David O. Russell. [Full review in Spanish].
rotten,"Disjointed and paced too slowly, it uses a convoluted plot to deliver a message that’s very simple"
rotten,This is not a cohesive plot.
fresh,"Stylish and evocative, this ambitious if overwrought throwback playfully spins a multilayered story with breezy efficiency, even if it lacks much background depth and relevant context."
fresh,"This murder mystery is a curious history lesson that comes without expecting us to know the dates or names, but exposing what we did and didn't learn and that might be the biggest mystery of all."
rotten,David O. Russell's starry misfire...
fresh,"...a flawed, subversive, and sometimes beautiful viewing experience."
rotten,"What we get from director-writer David O. Russell two movies/stories going on and one is more interesting than the other. Unfortunately, the interesting part is not the main story."
fresh,It's an intermittently entertaining but rather frustrating film that could have benefited from a little more focus.
fresh,You might be pleasantly surprised by Amsterdam. It’s an old school dark comedy with an uber-talented cast that all work together to create an enjoyable bit of cinematic escapism.
rotten,"What was once tumultuous in Russell’s work has now become tedious, resulting in a film about the lingering effects of the wars of our past and the wars to come that’s too caught up in its own internal combat to discover the compatibility that it seeks..."
rotten,"Alas, a starry guest list is one thing, a memorable party is another, and Russell’s tired and tiresome display is all set-up and no pay-off."
fresh,"The buddy bond that Bale and Washington forge goes a long way to holding Amsterdam together, and Robbie’s free-spirited third cements it."
fresh,"David O Russell keeps the tone light while punching bigger themes, so it feels somewhat uneven as the details begin to emerge. But the friendships at the centre are beautifully played, and the twisty narrative is both pointed and entertaining."
rotten,"Amsterdam would appear to be a veiled warning to America about fascism. Bale is funny and Robbie's star wattage keeps it afloat, but if I hadn't been trapped in a movie theater, I would have hit pause and started looking for something more stimulating."
rotten,"Russell’s new film, Amsterdam, feels like the weaknesses underlying all of his earlier works laid bare, fully exposed, without good ideas to hide behind because, quite frankly, there aren’t any real ideas here to speak of."
rotten,it should have just focused on the 3 friends but instead we get introduced to 2 dozen or so characters all with their own plotlines and eccentricities until it becomes too much.
rotten,The worst sin a movie can commit is to be boring. The second worst sin is to be confusing. Amsterdam commits both sins.
rotten,The idea of the story got too big... and he [David O. Russell] overstuffed it.
rotten,"Amsterdam is able to bring a few performances to the table that are worthy of raving about, but the overall experience is disappointing. The tone is all over the place, and the story feels disjointed."
rotten,"At once pretentious and self-important but also snarky and nearly nonsensical, ‘Amsterdam’ is one of the least pleasant, most inaccessible movies of the year."
rotten,Somewhere along the way the story gets lost in a sluggish haze.
fresh,"May “Amsterdam” ’s melodramatic sentimentality be forgiven; not many films of such exuberance, since the time of Chaplin, have been fuelled by such rage."
rotten,"If [Russell] had found his old screwball energy, he might have made his film’s multiple strands and cryptic plot gel together. Just as importantly, Amsterdam would have been a good deal funnier."
rotten,"Amsterdam is not a bad film by any means, as it remains watchable due to its appreciated efforts from the cast and crew. The film just needed a good captain to guide the ship from going overboard. Unfortunately, David O. Russell is not that person."
rotten,"A meandering, utterly inconsistent murder mystery bloated with an excess of quirkiness that squanders an all-star cast. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It’s a shaggy dog story in the classic sense, only the dog in question is a bit of a mutt."
rotten,"Amsterdam doesn’t match Russell’s best work...sure, the performances can be tasty but this oddly realized movie often has the feel of an interesting fellow who answers the doorbell without first pulling himself together."
rotten,Despite its ambitions (and spectacular cast) the film loses itself in its own indulgences. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Despite Russell’s being our cleverest satirist, Amsterdam succumbs to the worst ideas now afflicting our nation. Wonderfully humane as it is, Amsterdam can’t surmount the prevailing sense of failure."
fresh,"Russell’s conclusions are maudlin, but also curiously effective -- the film’s broad earnestness and sappy entreaties, prove hard to dismiss."
rotten,"The all-star cast talks, talks & talks some more within a murder mystery that is so convoluted the audience (represented by me) could care less about what was going on. Chris Rock acts like Chris Rock in 1930s America. Right. A lead balloon in quicksand."
fresh,"Though it falters in many major ways, David O. Russell’s not especially funny, tense or well-acted spiritual sequel to American Hustle is carried by an enviable cast and benign, off-kilter charm."
rotten,...like a Wes Anderson movie without the clockwork precision and sure command of tone.
rotten,"One of its basic premises, that rich and powerful people may be relied upon to act in their own interests and against those of the wider public, should not be hard to sell"
fresh,"You do have to pay attention, as every new twist takes you in a different direction.  That being said, head to the nearest cinema and book a ticket to “Amsterdam.”"
fresh,"Although the story seems to go around in circles, the trio are entertaining and quirky enough to help you forget the incoherent plot. Bale steals the show as a fun but peculiar character."
rotten,"Behind the high energy and flashy cast, there's a shocking lack of emotional depth — like a performer giving us jazz hands paired with a vacant stare."
fresh,"It's too long, and moves to slowly but the dialogue is funny, and the cast is terrific especially Margot Robbie. I had a good time. It's an old-fashioned entertaining Hollywood farce with friendship at the core and support for our veterans."
rotten,"In the same way that its bloated cast becomes a distraction which takes you out of the story, Amsterdam is unnecessarily convoluted, twisting its confusing narrative into a cobra knot."
fresh,"It’s on the lower end of Russell’s filmography in terms of memorability, but is handled with such a light, circusy touch that it’s not a bad way to kill a few hours."
rotten,Not even its top-notch cast is able to redeem this discordant film whose important message gets lost in the chaos. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Russell’s showy directorial pizzazz is very much in evidence, but there’s an edge of desperation to the chunks of exposition that dam the flow of this already meandering tale."
rotten,...succeeds only at finding incoherence.
fresh,"I admit, I fell for this messy, off-beat extravaganza. And I think it has a lot more to say than some may give it credit for."
rotten,"Racism, antisemitism, fascism, a seriously stern Robert De Niro, as an angry Marine General, and the very good Margot Robbie also play key roles in a crowded screenplay that misses more than it hits."
fresh,"David O. Russell’s “Amsterdam” is a sophisticated, three-stooge-like mystery that’s ultimately a love letter to veterans."
rotten,"As it accumulates running time (and characters and plot points), Amsterdam starts to get exhausting when it should perhaps feel liberating or intoxicating."
rotten,"For all its tepidness Amsterdam does grasp at bigger ideas .... That it feels like a piecemeal film made up of dozens of other films talking points and premises is precisely what cements its unremarkability, what a pity."
rotten,"What a cast and what an unfortunate use and waste of their talent. Writer/Director, David O. Russell makes this 1930’s murder mystery a long, rambling buddy film, but the disjointed script takes way too long to build up to the climax."
fresh,"The cherry on top of this film is the camaraderie between the characters portrayed by Bale, Washington, and Robbie.  We see the beginnings of the friendship and the love between them, and then seeing them become crime sleuths is quite amusing."
rotten,"Russell has actually crafted what at its core is a fundamentally simple story designed to push an overt message, before bogging it down in quirky supporting characters and unnecessary detours."
rotten,The excellent cast cannot overcome the convoluted script that has a good message but lacks real focus.
rotten,"Jaw-droppingly terrible, interminably dull..."
fresh,"Russell, to his everlasting credit, has made a film in which having cockeyed optimism, at this moment in the world, somehow feels like a radical act."
rotten,"The final voiceover smacks the audience over the head with The Point of the film so aggressively, it seems that Russell genuinely didn’t think anyone would be able to work it out for themselves."
rotten,"Amsterdam opens with the statement, “A lot of this really happened.” But audiences who sit through this confused mess of a movie aren’t going to know which parts are fact and which parts are fiction. Also, they’re unlikely to care."
fresh,"From Oscar-winning showman David O. Russell, 64, there's so much razzmatazz, artistry and comedic snap -- yet the antic pastiche lacks a satisfying mystery plot and, sadly, is less than the sum of its amazing performances."
rotten,"With its overblown stylings, and wavy, melodramatic tone, it's as if we're watching the feature debut of Max Fischer, the precocious teenager from Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore."" That's not intended as a compliment."
rotten,"[The] film that seems to aspire to the screwball of Preston Sturges. But the pace is too slow for that, the jokes too laboured, and while there are some fine comic performances, Amsterdam is muddled in its intentions."
rotten,"How five-time Oscar nominee David O. Russell, director and writer of “Amsterdam,” could squander such a star-studded award-winning cast in one of the most eagerly anticipated fall releases is more of a mystery than this convoluted period piece."
rotten,"Terribly written by Russell and obtusely edited (huge gaps between lines)... It’s mostly an endurance test. But, wow, those faces."
rotten,Russell's misstep with Amsterdam is as unexpected as it is shocking.
rotten,"A lot of interesting, colorful pieces that don't really fit together in this latest fizzy fizzle from David O. Russell."
rotten,"Overwrought and mostly exposition, ""Amsterdam"" is a beautiful corpse. Talented ensemble cast wasted."
fresh,"It is an inspiring movie, it gives you a breather and allows for the audience to forgive the ""mistunes"" and its lack of rhythm. At the end tells an untold story and as all those dark war stories, is worth to be told.. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Only in its milder moments, when Russell is not trying too hard to be madcap, or to badger us with dark political portents, does “Amsterdam” stir and convince."
rotten,"A three-headed showcase of Christian Bale, John David Washington, and Margot Robbie drives the narrative. Sadly, a mess of a screenplay sinks the film early and continues to distract throughout."
rotten,It feels as though the entire script were constructed from a rather rowdy game of Cards Against Humanity.
rotten,"Unfortunately, the movie is bad."
fresh,“Deep Water” can be a bit shallow and silly at times. But the basic thrills and surprising laughs it provides are more than enough to make for an entertaining evening.
rotten,After watching this film I am trying to comprehend how the two leads fell in love while filming.
rotten,One of the most frustrating & Boring films that I have seen in awhile. Yes there is some entertainment to it… but it goes away so fast & the film is only saved by the performances.
rotten,"The protagonists couldn't be more awful people in an incredibly toxic relationship that's frustrating to watch, but their lack of development and inexistent arcs make the narrative feel repetitive, predictable, and lacking intensity."
rotten,"Enticing and twisted, Deep Water sucks us into the journey with mesmerising lead performances and the prospect of an exciting climax, but unfortunately when the final destination is reached, it almost doesn't seem worth it."
rotten,"At the end of the day, it’s hard to call Deep Water disappointing. On the scale of the erotic thrillers that came before, it’s nothing memorable, but there is something admirable about its existence in 2022."
fresh,DEEP WATER is a well-made and enjoyable film. I laughed all the way through but it was mainly because of the direction of the story and where the sympathy for the characters lies.
rotten,Deep Water has some very interesting ideas and some great performances from Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas but the story is very messy and convoluted at times. Times were it feels like the stacks are high and others where I questioned the point of the story
rotten,"It's surprisingly earnest in the film's tawdry convictions. Still, I can't quite recommend Deep Water as the movie gets in way over its head."
rotten,"The result is an affair as dull and lifeless as one of the ex-lovers’ corpses floating in a river... if Indecent Proposal‘s Robert Redford walks up and offers you $1 million for one viewing of Deep Water, politely decline. It is simply not worth it."
rotten,"There is an alluring quality to its trashy story, and I loved the unexpected bites of pitch black humor which caught me off guard every time. But its lack of compelling twists (or really any twists whatsoever) zaps the movie of some needed energy."
rotten,"It’s all very slick, ideal for a 30-second cigarette advert, if people still made those."
rotten,This film doesn't give the audience much in regards to context and having something for us to remotely root for. This was a slow burn that never really paid off.
rotten,There's nothing remotely erotic about this movie. It felt like the actors were just tired throughout the making of this.
rotten,"Lyne tries to make an ode to jealousy as an aphrodisiac, and perhaps that makes sense to him, an 81-year-old man who found a gold mine in that kind of cinema seen today as fatuous, outdated and toxic. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The movie is weirdly coy with its sex scenes (in that there are almost none of them) and it feels like there are chunks missing throughout obscuring the satisfaction of the inevitable escalation to full thriller.
fresh,"It's a very silly movie, but watchable in its blatant ludicrousness."
rotten,"The biggest mystery is how this went so wrong, despite having all the right elements to succeed."
rotten,Doesn’t even work as a guilty pleasure. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Superficial thriller with limited range. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"The film's strong balance between seriousness and campiness, along with the sex appeal and star power of its leads, is enough to make up for most of what the film lacks."
fresh,"Spiritually closer to Lyne's Unfaithful than his 80s and 90s Erotic Thrillers, Deep Water is best when it explores the tensions within Vic and Melinda's open marriage. Affleck's somnabulist performance plays nicely off of de Armas' tempestuous sexpot"
rotten,"Considering Lyne's filmography, I was expecting something a little more passionate or even entertaining from ""Deep Water""; both Affleck and de Armas deserved something less shallow. Full review in Spanish."
rotten,"Deep Water never quite feels sexy enough for its lurid subject matter. Lyne may have been able to spin trash into art with his earlier efforts, but this film is a disappointingly shallow attempt at hearkening back to the glory days."
fresh,"Its a shame, after all the work at building this strange tension, that the last 10 minutes are bungled in almost comical fashion."
rotten,"There are nuggets of good ideas here and Lyne directs the film with aplomb, but did it have to be this dull?"
rotten,tricky territory that might have worked better and had a more profound and lasting effect had it been treated with more dramatic heft and less pulpy-erotic scheming
rotten,Its too many snails.
fresh,Deep Water doesn't quite represent the triumphant return of the star-studded erotic thriller... But it's a fun way to spend two hours and features two attractive leads messing with each other in a manner that sustains interest.
fresh,"Honestly, reflecting on this movie for more than five minutes will make the whole thing melt in your hands, so it’s best not to consider it for too long."
rotten,"Were it better written there might at least be some drama to the whole affair (even if their sexual games feel far from lurid), but in its battle to feel promiscuous and dangerous it feels like neither."
rotten,This Southern-fried Freud-meets-Tennessee Williams tries so hard to be contemporary but is like a drug-and-sexed-up version of one of those 1950s housewife melodramas featuring a handsome ne-er-do-well arriving in town.
rotten,"Believe it or not, its most outstanding achievement was making me laugh without even trying to be funny."
fresh,"With a few drinks under your belt on a Friday or Saturday night, this wonky flick from the director of Fatal Atrraction will do the trick just nicely/nastily."
fresh,Deep Water is a star-studded throwback to the days when sexy thrillers about adults doing adult things didn't go straight to the small screen.
fresh,"OK, it’s not Body Heat.  But it kept my motor running."
rotten,"""Deep Water"" is a tepid version of what Lyne was once a master of doing."
fresh,"In Deep Water, the confused confluence of passion, jealousy and manliness are animating forces even among the so-very-civilized private schools and cocktail parties set."
rotten,"I didn't like this movie, mostly because I didn't believe this movie."
rotten,"Despite the credentials of those involved, it is a very flat film."
fresh,"Even though there are moments throughout the film that defy believability, Deep Water is an enticing return for Lyne."
rotten,"Deep Water is a great example of what can happen when you let otherwise competent movie stars just go for it, for better or—and in this case it’s mostly “or”—worse."
rotten,"The cinematic equivalent of waiting for your bread to toast, only to realize hours later you forgot to plug in the damn thing."
rotten,Adrian Lyne's best films intellectualise the juicy plotting of your average airport novel; Deep Water just feels like an average airport novel.
fresh,"Fortunately, Lyne does have Affleck and de Armas, and they certainly don't account for nothing, lifting the material far higher than their director ever could."
rotten,Deep Water is the worst film I've seen in a long time. The story never progresses and you keep waiting for the climax that never happens. The character's actions are never explained or given much depth.
fresh,"Deep Water is far from the best movie youll see all year, but it has just enough gas in its tank to drive you to press play and keep you from exiting until the credits roll."
rotten,Deep Water is an accomplished but essentially unremarkable entry in the Highsmith filmography.
rotten,"In some ways, I’m happy to have even a simulacrum of a movie for grownups. But I’ve been waiting 20 years for the new Adrian Lyne to drop, as it were. This wasn’t worth the wait."
rotten,"A feeble, witless adaptation...Lyne and his screenwriters never stray from familiar tableaux... The actors portraying the emotionally sadomasochistic couple cant evince the merest spark of shambolic erotic energy between them."
fresh,"As Gothic, soapy, and tacky the story and execution, we want to see who wins."
fresh,"Lyne may not have recaptured his glory days here, but he has given us a robustly acted mystery thriller we can all sink our teeth into."
rotten,"This film, while satisfyingly glossy and sexy, is nevertheless too implausible and contrived to really generate much suspense."
rotten,"What the ‘90s erotic thriller was to hardcore pornography, Deep Water is to the ‘90s erotic thriller: an echo of something way more stimulating."
rotten,"Deep Water unravels quickly into a limpid and ultimately preposterous amble down a very predictable, intrigue-free path."
fresh,"Sleek and insinuating, this dark mystery holds the attention with its intense characters and offbeat situations, orchestrated expertly by veteran director Adrian Lyne."
rotten,The only time (Affleck) seems to smile is looking at his snail farm. Anyone looking for a 2022 update of the Sad Ben Affleck meme will find a hard drives worth of material here.
fresh,"Nonsensical, but gleefully so...Deep Water isnt all that deep, but hey  splashing around in the shallow end can be fun too."
rotten,I could have sworn that erotic thrillers were supposed to be erotic and/or thrilling.
fresh,"Deep Water is a movie for grown-ups. Not for prurient interests, mind, but for students of behaviour--of snails and other things."
rotten,"The master of the erotic thriller, Adrian Lyne, returns after 20 years; the master of self-aware acting, Ben Affleck, continues a stellar run. But something about this movie just leaves you feeling limp."
rotten,"Despite its genre and two conventionally attractive leads, Hulu’s new movie leans more into weirdness than sexiness..."
rotten,"Committed performances by Ana de Armas and Ben Affleck aren't enough to save this frustrating and boring story, that's neither exciting or interesting. In general, a big letdown. Full review in Spanish"
fresh,"Cuban actress Ana de Armas's role as Melinda in ""Deep Water"" is certainly complex and dynamic, but, her character has me thinking maybe I should be a little more careful what I wish for."
fresh,Sensational erotic adult thriller about rich people toying with infidelity. de Armas captives with a provocative performance. Grace Jenkins upstages de Armas with a song.
fresh,Everything in Deep Water competent but a little bit dull
rotten,"It doesnt work, because the ambiguity of the characters is misapportioned."
rotten,"Are we aroused in the same way as we enter the 2020s? Adrian Lyne's return with Deep Water looks to answer this question and while it doesn't entirely work, it does open a doorway long thought closed."
rotten,"Deep Water seems determined to know nothing, and to bore us while doing so."
fresh,"Deep Water has abandoned thought and logic for horny, unhinged vibes. It’s so much beautiful fun."
fresh,"There is a problem with a Patricia Highsmith adaptation of all things having a ""don’t think too much and just vibe"" approach given that her work is so proudly brainy. Still, I couldn’t help but be won over by this almost nostalgic offering."
fresh,Deep Water is a sweat-inducing psychological scheme that is constantly aiming to intrigue and titillate.
rotten,Lyne keeps the pot simmering and simmering and then we look in the pot and it’s empty.
rotten,"It does, finally, get under the skin, if you can make it through the tepid sex and stretches of tedium. Melinda and Vics transgressiveness may not be explained, or believable, but it eventually becomes oddly compelling."
rotten,"It's a strange thing to call a Lyne movie tame, but by his standards, Deep Water is."
rotten,"Even if you're intrigued by the thought of a new erotic thriller in 2022, stay far away from ""Deep Water."""
rotten,"A shadowy role for Affleck, but not in a good way ... he can't seem to grasp character roles. This story also suffered from if you're trying to guess what's going on  and if you guess anywhere near correctly ... it wont be that great an experience."
rotten,Strange that a movie that's supposed to be an erotic thriller isn't very erotic or thrilling. Unexpected laughs keep this reasonably enjoyable despite its many flaws and no one has a scowling glare like Affleck.
rotten,Shallow Stream is a more appropriate title.
rotten,"Deep Water seems to be a misbegotten vanity project greenlit in the first flush of a celebrity couple’s hots for one another, completed just as they break up, and thereafter politely ignored by everyone involved."
rotten,"It was hard for me to close the distance between myself and this movie, to get into it, simply because it felt ... mechanical. The seams show."
fresh,"Deep Water's flaws and loose ends notwithstanding, there's a particular pleasure in watching Affleck and de Armas act out this dumpster fire of a marriage, no matter how implausible it becomes."
rotten,"A cheesy erotic thriller from a veteran of the genre, based on a Patricia Highsmith novel, may sound like movie gold, but the end result is eye-rollingly ridiculous."
rotten,[A] tepid and frustratingly shallow thriller...
rotten,"""As a psycho-sexual whodunit, the perverse plot makes no sense whatever."""
rotten,"Hulu subscribers are in for here is a lukewarm R-rated affair that, while being highly concerned with attraction, is only occasionally fatal."
rotten,"Ben Affleck has more chemistry with a cup of Dunkin' Donuts in paparazzi pics than he has onscreen with Ana De Armas. What a shame this is the next of her films to come out after a delightful turn in ""No Time to Die."" At best it's a cacophony of mediocre."
rotten,"In a world in which Gone Girl exists, this movie isn't very necessarily"
fresh,This is an enjoyably dark peek into the desires and demands of an outwardly unhappy married couple that entertains with a deceptively light touch.
rotten,"This was a solid attempt at something good but even with some good actors and some superb directing, the story doesnt hold together to make this a fulfilling watch."
fresh,"All this is depicted, of course, with tactile beauty and visual restlessness; the human figures move in space, within decors that are sumptuous and simmer...  Polish and trashiness remain eager bedmates."
rotten,This erotic thriller is short on thrills and eroticism.
rotten,Waste of my time and their talent.
rotten,"Alas, a thriller is like flying across the ocean: You either get there or you don’t. Pilots get no credit for making it 90 percent of the way to Ireland, and this film sputters out of fuel in the final act."
rotten,"If there’s a point to it, Lyne is keeping it close to the vest. Perhaps it’s time for him to take a stab at something other than unholy matrimony."
rotten,"Deep Water doesn’t pan out. It doesn’t add up. Not in a fun way: in an unsatisfying way. The ingredients are largely there, but by even the standards of a genre that no one insists should make complete sense, the movie doesn’t really make sense."
rotten,"Deep Water aspires to be a boundary-pushing erotic thriller but is stuck treading water in the kiddie pool. Director Adrian Lyne, who used to be a bonafide closer in this genre, must have lost his “how to make it horny” handbook."
fresh,"While the movie falls apart toward the end, the mystery -- and crackling central performances -- cruises along at a low boil much of the way."
rotten,Deep Water is deeply dull.
fresh,"Through Lyne’s expertise as well as Affleck and de Armas’ gameness about their semi-transparency, the erotic thriller once again attains its highest aspiration by obliterating the concept of the guilty pleasure."
rotten,"Deep Water comes dressed up as an ‘80s-style erotic thriller, a genre that I, for one, would love to see revived. But it’s so tepid, so lacking in heat or even a pulse, that it’s about as sexy as a clogged artery."
rotten,"Deep Water might look slick, but feels both shallow and soulless."
rotten,This one is bonkers. Top to bottom bonkers.
rotten,"t’s hard to believe that Adrian Lyne, responsible for huge box-office hits like the provocative thriller Fatal Attraction and the dodgy but watchable 9 ½ Weeks and Indecent Proposal, could make something quite so feeble as Deep Water."
rotten,Deep Water is a desperate attempt to provoke viewers instead of making them think.
rotten,"It’s steamy to be sure, and Armas carries it off with brazen bravado, but the film works only in wisps."
fresh,"It’s a welcome return for Lyne, who has lost none of his penchant for directly purveying the perverse tendencies of human nature railing against the rigidity of traditional relationships."
rotten,"... watered down to fit a standard erotic thriller framework that lacks the necessary sizzle and ironic self-awareness, and never fulfills its twisty Hitchcockian ambitions."
rotten,"An erotic thriller that starts off intriguing, but sinks under its underdeveloped foundation."
rotten,"What should be a taut, gripping, suspense-laden thriller looks more like the husk of one despite all the major names in front of and behind the camera."
rotten,"""Deep Water"" is a tame attempt at a psychological thriller that never delves into the psychological, is short on thrills, and relies too much on the audience to fill in its own blanks."
rotten,The erotic part is very obvious. The thriller part is where the movie falls short.
fresh,"Not a great book-to-screen adaptation, but the film is a slow burn thriller thats adequate enough to meet lowered expectations."
rotten,"Adrian Lyne misfire Deep Water wastes talents of Ben Affleck, Ana de Armas and author Patricia Highsmith."
fresh,"A vicious piece of work, a movie made by a filmmaker who is unafraid to see the primal, darker parts that beautiful people hide behind their gorgeous facades."
fresh,Leaves things stuck in deep water.
fresh,Ben Affleck sniffing his snails: that is what you are in for if you commit to watching Deep Water.
rotten,"Deep Water makes it difficult for viewers to gravitate toward either lead character, but beyond that, the mystery is never compelling enough to care about."
fresh,"Deep Water plays like a sexy, macabre Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, an intense dialogue between an unhappily married couple thats occasionally disrupted by outsiders."
fresh,"Not the most elegant exploration of toxicity, but it's one that tackles the subject through refreshingly provocative intentions... Full Review in Spanish"
fresh,"But while Luhrmann's warts-and-all love letter to his sunburnt homeland is both a little half-baked and overdone, there's still enough invention and pure passion to ensure an entertaining, if not entirely engrossing, watch."
rotten,"Manages an epic feel and an extreme runtime, though the former is oftentimes merely a result of the latter."
rotten,"Australia, almost despite itself, isn't really an awful film."
fresh,A beautifully rendered but flawed pastiche of the grand epics of old.
rotten,"Look, I realize this subject is a labor of love for Luhrmann, but the real pain comes from watching the final product -- not making it."
fresh,"What you do get... is a firm commitment to epic, triple-espresso-shot extreme romance (the kind spelled XTREEEM!) and the kind of tear-jerking that involves having both your arms wrenched behind your back until you holler ""Uncle!"""
fresh,"Australia, a heaping blend of romance, adventure and action, is for all those folks who ask, ""Why don't they make movies like they used to?"
rotten,"Australia is as big, lumbering, vast, dry, and aimless as the catch-all title would lead you to believe."
fresh,"Unless you don't remember what it's like to be so young with a head full of daydreams, you'll be happy to be carried off into the gorgeous Australian sunset."
fresh,"Australia works well enough to recommend, but this will likely be the least-worshiped movie in Luhrmann's filmography."
rotten,When [Luhrmann] goes from silly to turgid in 60 seconds flat -- he punctures Australia's proportions down from epic to simply overwrought.
rotten,There's a lot that feels jarringly overdone here.
rotten,"Hard-hitting social commentary is not [Baz Luhrmann's] forte and while he strives for analogy and pertinence, all is lost in a dust cloud of galloping horses and magical realist swish."
fresh,"Australia offers an often engaging story with some amazing cinematic moments. But with less self-indulgence on Luhrmann's part, it could have achieved greatness."
fresh,"""Australia"" is a shameless-and shamelessly entertaining-pastiche. It works because Luhrmann, a true believer in movie-movie magic, stamps it all with the force of his own extravagant, generous personality."
rotten,"Australia strains hard for epic Gone with the Wind territory, but it is undone by its own hubris, although, to be fair, the scenes of the Australian outback almost make the film worth seeing. Almost..."
rotten,The effect of watching a Baz Luhrmann film is indistinguishable from the effect of having a crater-sized parcel of glitter dropped on your head.
fresh,What a pleasant surprise to discover that the film has earned its sweeping title.
fresh,
rotten,"Throw out the beefcake, the Stilton cheese, and the sub-Dynasty empire-building bushwah."
fresh,
rotten,A funny frankenstein that's worth seeing just to point and laugh at.
fresh,"""Australia"" occasionally stumbles into corny sidesteps like Hugh Jackman's ""Oh, crikey"" catchphrase. But Baz Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns - dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves."
fresh,Australia is an enchanting throwback to an era of filmmaking which strived to entertain its audiences with dazzling spectacle and melodrama.
fresh,"If you are willing to take the plunge and view things through Luhrmann's prism, Australia does deliver the classic dramatic and romantic satisfactions its ambitious advertising campaign promises."
rotten,Luhrmann just piles quotation mark on top of quotation mark
fresh,"Whilst it's not the masterpiece we so desperately wanted it to be, Australia still manages to be a good time at the cinema."
fresh,"It's a bit overloaded, though I love Luhrmann's obvious enthusiasm."
fresh,Here's a film you probably sneered at as its ads played for its mega-plex roll out. I beg you not to let you keep that from now buying the DVD.
rotten,"It is a huge film - in scale, scope, look and feel, and of course budget. It is also a huge disappointment."
fresh,"Sometimes seems to be overwhelmed by Baz Luhrmann's excess, but the strength of his vision, the appeal of his visuals and the skill of his actors keep the film from capsizing."
rotten,"Much like Scorsese's Gangs of New York, it's a film that has been long labored over, and the artist's love of the material is clear, but the inspiration has been lost along the way."
fresh,"Recalls the old-fashioned, golden-age Hollywood movie-movies that wrapped forbidden desire, aching heartbreak, personal tragedy, war, adventure and breathtaking thrills in a glittering overlay of movie-star glamor."
fresh,"Unfortunately, between its predictably and the absence of chemistry between Kidman and Jackman, Australia amounts to little more than an amusing if just as readily-forgettable diversion."
fresh,This is a movie for those who say they don't make 'em like they used to.
rotten,A busca de Austrália por uma identidade cinematográfica acaba levando o filme a oscilar perigosamente entre tons terrivelmente díspares.
rotten,"o Baz Luhrmann htizei enan oyranoksysti apo filodoksies, pairnei to asanser gia tin taratsa kai boytaei sto keno"
fresh,"Unashamedly old-fashioned and corny, if not quite up to the director's usual high standards."
rotten,Did I mention it's really long?
fresh,"Often beautiful but wildly inconsistent, Australia is none more Baz Luhrmann, which perhaps says it all. Worth a look on the big screen, though."
fresh,"It's a fine romp, epic in both ambition and visuals if not narrative - and if director Baz Luhrmann had stopped at the end of the love story's trajectory, the audience would have left entirely happy."
fresh,"Australia is an epic love story, and a quite extraordinary piece of kitsch. Everything about the film is wildly over the top."
rotten,"We are left with slow-moving insincerity and conceit, summoned up in the flatulence of that title: Australia, a country reborn in terms of facetious Hollywood cliches."
fresh,"Luhrmann's imagination too, demented and over reaching though it might be, is a glorious and vagrant thing to behold. His passion and romanticism, precisely because it's not trimmed and edited, exhilarates."
fresh,"Australia would love to be The African Queen, but is more The Australian Prince Charles: silly, longwinded, heart in the right place."
fresh,"It's anything but cool. It's warm, it has a big heart, and if you look at it in the right light, it's really rather beautiful."
fresh,"Some of it doesn't work, but it remains a gloriously ambitious romantic epic and a truly memorable big-screen movie experience."
fresh,"The photography is a knockout. All Australia needed was a script with a sustained story and a stronger sense of where, and how, tragic drama should take over from camp seriocomedy."
rotten,"Nothing wrong with a film's reach exceeding its grasp, but Luhrmann's ambition has left this one looking forlorn and exposed: Australia clears a huge space for itself and then hasn't the wit or the wherewithal to fill it."
fresh,It's a thoroughly enjoyable romp - the cinematic equivalent of a bath-full of Quality Street.
rotten,"Australia is a film for which you have constantly to suspend your disbelief. I did for some of the way, but in the end began to think it was a cross between the plonking Pearl Harbor and an expensive but routine sort of Oz western."
fresh,"Part western, part war movie and part epic romance, Baz Luhrmann's latest extravaganza is cheesy and ridiculous on several levels but it's also surprisingly enjoyable and never boring, despite its lengthy running time."
rotten,"Jackman persuades as an Outback cowboy, Kidman's cut glass accent doesn't. Walters as Nullah is a great discovery. Australia is a soap opera of moods but eye candy Kidman is too fey a character to hold this diva show together."
rotten,Never quite locks together into the sweeping cinematic journey Luhrmann clearly set out to create.
rotten,"With plot is similar to a Barbara Stanwyck '50s Western by way of Out of Africa, Luhrmann directs Kidman in a surprisingly scene-chewing performance."
rotten,"an endurance test of good intentions and tangled ideas, exploited facts and fuzzy fictions, where the performances, like the plot, are slapped onto the beautiful backgrounds with the broadest - and clumsiest - of strokes."
fresh,"Overcoming choppy storytelling, this film ultimately proves that the sum of its flawed parts is still a more than worthwhile adventure."
fresh,"In his kitschy way, Luhrmann delivers the goods, even when his big moments inspire tears of laughter rather than emotion."
fresh,"By the end, your wonderment at Luhrmann's inextinguishable enthusiasm for hokum starts to break you down and win you over."
fresh,"The film is trying at times, but there is no question that the sheer spectacle of the film makes much of the consternation worth it."
fresh,"Luhrmann shamelessly indulges in the most sweeping style of filmmaking imaginable, filling the screen with expansive images, action and emotion, plus plenty of cheesy camp"
fresh,"Kitsch and cliche drive the story, but the faces and locations are stunning -- when the movie's over, you feel like you've been somewhere and seen something."
fresh,"A lively, rollicking, overlong, overstuffed movie that tries my patience as much as it entertains me."
fresh,The excess is part of its charm; Luhrmann sees the classic movie genres as a magical playground and he wants to play on all the rides.
rotten,"Luhrmann... apparently decided this time to make about five movies at once, as Australia fluctuates wildly among many genres and many more different tones. And it's long. So, so long."
fresh,"Not just unashamedly old-fashioned, but altogether smug about it... For myself, I admire the defiant mustiness of the whole project."
rotten,One wonders if there are any tablecloth cliches about Australia that have been missed.
fresh,"Whether or not Baz Luhrmann's Australia is a great film, it is one hell of a movie."
rotten,"Had the team abandoned the tediously tidy final third of the film and all the awful World War II shenanigans we obviously don't care about, Australia would be a wild romp."
fresh,Baz Luhrmann's perfectly executed epic is a winner all the way. Kidman and Jackman are great but young Brandon Walters steals the show.
rotten,"There's a lot to admire here, but not enough."
rotten,It's trying so hard to be epic instead of just being epic.
rotten,Nullah's story lies beyond the ken of his Caucasian caretakers.
rotten,"It has very little of [Moulin Rouge]'s irreverence or nose-thumbing spirit, opting instead for a stubborn adherence to the tenets of the budget-busting Hollywood prestige pictures of the 1950s and 1960s."
fresh,Sometimes Luhrmann seems to be living in a Dreamtime of his own; his movie is all over the map. But what a gorgeous map it is.
rotten,Luhrmann is drawn to kitsch as inevitably as a bear to honey.
rotten,"With three storylines, a ludicrous performance by Kidman, and Baz's self-indulgence getting the best of him, AUSTRALIA is one of this year's biggest blunders."
fresh,"A wildly enjoyable experience, reconstituting some of the great traditions of the art form in engaging, unexpected ways."
fresh,"At its best, it's funny, inventive and sweepingly sentimental. At its worst, it's a dead root, a miscast romance between a sexless pairing of actors."
rotten,The plot's key turning points have either too much or not enough emphasis and are often in the wrong spot.
fresh,"Rich, ambitious and often brave, this is a film that reaches, with desperately clawing outstretched hands, for greatness."
fresh,"It's not the masterpiece we've been waiting for, but Australia is still an ambitious, at times even awesome, movie experience."
rotten,You don't find many three-hour fairy tale love story war films about race relations featuring the ultra-competitive beef market in northern Australia. For good reason.
rotten,"This is a movie that doesn't just want to take over the cineplex--it wants to own it. For better and worse, it has a hell of a time doing so, though not without belching and hicupping along the way."
fresh,A film as grand as the Down Under itself.
fresh,"Australia isn't ""Titanic 2.0,"" but neither is it ""Heaven's Gate."
fresh,"'Australia' runs out of steam along its lengthy journey, but it boasts gorgeous cinematography, a passionate romance, and more than a few thrilling scenes."
fresh,"With measured visual flash, Luhrmann highlights the delightful presence of his two stars and realizes an unlikely feelgood film, in spite of its grave matters."
rotten,"It's City Slickers. I mean, come on."
fresh,"It's a very broadly drawn movie and being something of a rarity, I'm inclined to encourage you to give this continent-sized epic a bit of a go."
fresh,"Sumptuous and romantic, Australia is a gorgeous, ambitious epic achieved with Baz Luhrmann's inimitable style. Kidman and Jackman are at their best and awfully nice to look at. What's not to love?"
rotten,A strictly 1940s vintage Hollywood florid spectacle melodrama.
rotten,"Australia, director Baz Luhrmann's sweeping, romantic epic that takes place in the outback during the World War II-era, is exactly like the Energizer Bunny: It keeps going and going and going."
fresh,A note-worthy attempt but it's hard to ignore all the inconsistencies in this movie -- like the thrown-in fish-out-of-water segment about the Wizard of the Oz.
fresh,"An old-fashioned, screen-filling picture that is at times as rousing and untamed as the continent that it depicts."
rotten,We could have had something really representing the vibrant Aussie film industry.
fresh,AUSTRALIA is a film that's simply way too earnest for our cynical age.
rotten,"Swells of emotion & panoramic stampedes fill the screen; however, meandering scenes in between have been cut out at the seams so often, you'll be wandering what it all means."
rotten,"Although visually interesting, this latest from Baz Luhrmann is all over a map bigger than Australia."
rotten,"Luhrmann labors to frame his work as a grandiose social problem film -- rarely has a movie tried so hard, and so fruitlessly, for our love"
fresh,"Recreates the old pleasure of discovering an epic en masse...One moment in particular elicited a mass groan of ecstasy from our packed audience, which then elicited empathetic giggles from everyone."
rotten,"Like the kangaroo that goes from a newcomer's sightseeing delight to dinner meat with the sudden crack of a rifle shot, Australia hops all over the place."
fresh,The epic scope of the filmmaking gives you newfound appreciation for what a visionary filmmaker can achieve when given the chance to make films without compromise.
fresh,The massive panoramas of wild Australia suddenly make Luhrmanns wild flourishes look puny.
rotten,"Not just long and extravagant but woozy and ultimately rather silly...Luhrmann might have been aiming, Selznick-like, for a new Gone With the Wind, but his picture ends up feeling more like a second Duel in the Sun."
rotten,"The result is mostly a woodenly derivative melding of '40s maternal melodramas, oaters and World War II actioners."
fresh,"A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and historic revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining."
rotten,"Australia tries to be a sprawling, romantic epic. Instead, it's a melodramatic exercise in tedium."
fresh,"At once sprawling and intimate, melodramatic and comic, magnificent and utterly bonkers, it bears entertaining witness to Luhrmann's love of old movies and his Down Under homeland."
rotten,"Are we so desperate to sate our malnourished nostalgia for movie magic that we'd settle for a facsimile so grand, lavish and empty?"
fresh,Australia delivers with real panache.
fresh,"As ridiculous as Australia often is, it's also ridiculously entertaining."
fresh,"Australia offers plenty of fun, and parades more spectacle, sweeping camera movement and gushy sentimental romance than can possibly be absorbed in 2 1/2 hours."
rotten,"[Luhrmann] veers from earnest drama to brisk comedy and then tries to hold it together with awkward voiceover narration. Within five minutes, Australia seems headed for trouble. It gets there and stays there."
fresh,"For much of its more than 2 1/2- hour length, this sweeping film from Aussie director Baz Luhrmann provides old-fashioned thrills and entertainment."
rotten,"It looks great, but the same comment can be made about Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, which shares more than a passing resemblance."
rotten,Long in the making -- and almost as long in the watching -- Baz Luhrmann's Australia is epic piffle.
fresh,"Australia is a wildly over the top look at Down Under, about what we might have expected from Aussie director Baz Luhrmann."
rotten,"Yes, you can enjoy bits and pieces along the way, more than a few, even. At the end of this journey, though, you feel more exhaustion and relief than catharsis or satisfaction."
rotten,"Baz Luhrmann's Australia isn't a history of the penal colony turned commonwealth, but Luhrmann's absurd, cliché-ridden filmmaking ought to be a jailable offense."
rotten,"A bloody, humorless debacle of a ""comedy"""
fresh,"No carols are sung. No Santa is seen, and the decorations are few and far in-between. This is more of an anti-Christmas, anti-feel-good flick, but it's one you might want to watch more than once."
rotten,"Dark, depressing comedy has lots of cursing, drinking."
fresh,"Buried deep beneath all the booze and bullets, there is some humanity here - it just takes a little digging to unearth it all."
rotten,"Dreadful, but it's difficult to tell who's to blame for this mess."
fresh,"And although it is true that Shazam! The Fury of the Gods is not as well-rounded as its predecessor, it maintains the elements that made the first a good film. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"You've got your poorly lit CGI climax, lines out of the ""Sir, this is a Wendy's"" playbook, enough product placement to qualify for a Super Bowl ad, and another appearance by ""Sabotage,"" which is evidently the only Beastie Boys song allowed in movies."
rotten,"Fury of The Gods leans into what worked for the first film and takes advantage of minimal exposition, though it suffers from rushed plot."
rotten,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods has its moments of amusement, but they are swallowed up by sequences that run too long and trying to shoehorn the natural wackiness of the first film into the second without allowing us to see any growth in Billy until the end."
fresh,David F. Sandberg delivers a wholesome sequel that is harmless fun.
fresh,"There’s enough charm in Fury of the Gods that fans of the original should still appreciate, but it lacks the spark to keep this franchise going under the new DCU regime."
rotten,What keeps the film from being a total failure are the valiant acting efforts by Mirren and Liu. This film will haunt them but they can never be accused of just picking up a paycheck.
fresh,"Shazam: Fury of the Gods is, very simply, a mess that should really have been better than it is, but that doesn't mean that it isn't still a lot of fun"
rotten,"While the performances were decent, Shazam! Fury of the Gods ultimately felt like a standard superhero package. It follows a predictable formula with a basic storyline, a few laughs, some good and bad CGI, and a decent background score."
rotten,"The movie falls into the trap of exaggerating what worked in the original, excessively tackling every narrative aspect, and losing authenticity along the way."
rotten,"Fury of the Gods tries to convince audiences that it’s a charming movie about chosen family, but it’s just a run-of-the-mill superhero flick."
fresh,Zachary Levi & the whole crew gush with charm & I loved seeing that David Sandberg really brought in the mythical side of the DC UNIVERSE. I won’t go as far to say that this is perfect as it’s missing quite a few beats but I grinned ear to ear.
fresh,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods might be the most fun I’ve had with a superhero film for half the budget. It didn’t need $200 million dollars to feel competently made, it shines with its constraints and has a keen sense of practicality."
rotten,"Why do I call Shazam “down-market”? Well, in Justice League, the A-team superheroes are trying to stop the A-team super villains from destroying the world. In Fury of the Gods, Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is trying to save Philadelphia."
fresh,"The film is generally enjoyable, and certainly stands up better than other recent DC Comics adaptations, but there is an unavoidable sense of contractual obligation to it."
fresh,"This is nothing actively bad in this unmemorable sequel, but there’s nothing actively really good either."
rotten,"As someone who finds the first film to be the most enjoyable and balanced of the DC universe films, this film felt leaden and in search of purpose until finally finding its calling as a big-screen Skittles commercial."
rotten,Overstuffed and overbearing.
fresh,"The truly frustrating thing about ""Fury of the Gods"" is all the potential it contains, not just its own standalone story, but how unhinged a third film could be now that so much of the setup and emotional baggage has been explored."
rotten,"It may boast a few impressive cast members, but with its toned-down levity & unengaging storyline, it becomes just another flat, forgettable entry that fits right in with the other bland DC films of the past decade."
fresh,"…Shazam 2 doesn’t aim to do much more than re-tread the ’kid that’s friends with superheroes’ theme of the original film, but the laws of diminishing returns applies…"
rotten,"“Shazam! Fury of the Gods” is serviceable superhero storytelling, but it’s missing the great spark of absurdity that made the first movie so engaging."
fresh,"Zachary Levi's Shazam is a really fun character, and it's a shame they can't find the right use for him."
rotten,"Shazam: Fury of the Gods is wholesome family fun but flat and very safe. Thematic arcs felt familiar, villains weren’t captivating & VFX was shoddy  With superhero films now, if you aren’t fresh, you’re forgettable."
rotten,Where was I? Right: this movie is disposable junk.
rotten,"The low-key hang-out family movie vibe [of the first Shazam] has been ditched in favor of a bunch of loud  sound effects and glossy, lifeless CGI."
fresh,"Some baffling decisions made here but overall, Shazam 2 is a mostly fun time with a fair amount of heart."
rotten,Shazam! Fury of the Gods is a disappointment that takes the wonderful work of the first film and has no idea what to do with it.
rotten,"An uneasy mixture of YA superhero flick, warmhearted family movie, and effects-laden action picture, it proves once again that more does not translate to better."
rotten,"Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu give it their all, but the childishness and lack of consequence renders even the coolest action sequences and effects meaningless"
rotten,"Where Shazam! Fury of the Gods suffers in comparison to the 2019 original is in its erratic, confused tone and swollen screenplay"
rotten,...one of the worst comic-book adaptations to hit theaters in a good long while.
rotten,"The film has sequel-itis in the worst way. Everything has to be bigger, which totally negates the charm that the first film had."
fresh,"Like the first Shazam! movie, it has a warm heart and semi-believable family relationships. It certainly doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s noisy and obnoxious, but also kind of fun."
rotten,Stumbles down the narrow line between “kid-friendly” and “just plain juvenile.”
rotten,Shazam! Fury of the Gods is better than Black Adam...but I find myself forgetting it soon after it ends.
fresh,"The best way to sum up this review is “c’mon, guys, it’s not that bad.” I realize that isn’t exactly a ringing endorsement for a movie, but it’s good enough to provide a mildly amusing escape for a couple of hours."
rotten,"Unfortunately, it falls into the trap of exaggerating what worked in the original, going overboard in almost every aspect of the narrative and losing authenticity along the way. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"What a fun hero movie, there's so much to love about this film, as the main character is heartwarming and endearing as he questions his every move."
fresh,Shazam! Fury of the Gods doubles down on the same charm which made the original soar and the resulting film is a sequel that’s easily the equal of its enjoyable predecessor.
fresh,"While this movie is not as good as the original 2019 film, it is still entertaining in terms of action, humor and spectacle."
rotten,"DC has always struggled to make solid, coherent superhero movies. One of the few times they got it right was with the first ""Shazam"". Sadly, lightening fails to strike twice in ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods""."
rotten,Sandberg’s lack of interest in character development and reliance on style over substance calls back to the superhero movie era we all wish we could forget.
rotten,"A mistake of a movie crafted with good intentions, but completely loses the core of this family of characters with its poorly thought out antagonists and journey."
fresh,"Kids will like it and parents will be able to stand it, but most of the film is by the numbers, so don't expect too many surprises."
rotten,Zachary Levi is annoying; Helen Mirren is wasted; nothing works as good this time out as it did before.
rotten,The original film left nothing of substance for this superhero sequel.
fresh,"The whole concept of superhero universes, especially recently, is to create a feeling of importance, even when that really isn’t the case. So it’s weird and strangely refreshing to watch one of these where that’s 100 percent not the case."
rotten,The disappointing sequel to Shazam! is the first of four leftover films that DC will release during an awkward year of transition...
rotten,There was nothing really exciting about it.
rotten,"The original was adorkable, and the follow-up is dismissible. Shazam! Fury of the Gods is a soul-crushing disappointment. Sandberg’s follow-up is the ultimate antonym to the original—a dull, dark, and unfunny follow-up with no magic left in the tank."
fresh,"Again, there’s not much new here, but the light-hearted approach – which puts Mirren’s serious turn in a  humorous light- makes all the difference."
fresh,"The story is uncomplicated and very straightforward, the focus on family that sits at the heart of the narrative is both engaging and impactful."
fresh,"The quirky humor, mostly from Jack Dylan Grazer, makes it more fun than not. Despite some baffling choices and an ending that pulled every punch, this is a sequel that offers plenty of entertainment - even if it isn't close to being spectacular."
fresh,"It lose some of the charm of the original by focusing on bigger set pieces, but it still delivers plenty of laughs, action, and emotion."
rotten,"Si estás buscando algo más allá de chistes que no siempre son cómicos, una trama sin propósito definido y personajes subdesarrollados, entonces no es la película para ti."
fresh,"Full of heart, warmth and charm, this is a slight, frothy follow-up that is only occasionally overly sentimental."
rotten,"The first Shazam! outing was a hoot. It successfully combined the endearing, goofball energy of Penny Marshall’s Big with the plucky sci-fi charm of Richard Donner’s Superman. In contrast, this bulky, effects-heavy follow-up is a joyless mess."
rotten,Shazam! Fury of the Gods loses the thing that made it special.
fresh,"Zachary Levi is simply charmingly consistent tapping into his inner child for Billy a But, the real win for me, is the fact that there is a woman of every single age, ethnicity and skill within the young cast and the their more mature counterparts."
rotten,"If you're under 13 this could be fun, if you're 13-18 you're going to be like ""what is this?"" and if you're older than that, you're gonna check out."
fresh,"While the film almost, almost falls into the same trap the second Wonder Woman film fell in - relying too much in its final acts on dumb and confusing CGI carnage - it remains an enjoyable slice of silliness."
fresh,"Silly, sweet and packed with smiles, this sequel duplicates original's charm."
rotten,Neither Mirren nor unicorns are enough to make this worth seeing.
rotten,"What are good movies like? Given the last couple of months, I'm sort of forgetting."
rotten,There are few superhero movies that have lower human stakes.
rotten,"Fury of the Gods feels oddly empty for a film with far too many characters, coasting solely off any remaining goodwill earned by its predecessor. This narrative tries to pretend it has a heart to cover up the overabundant sense of nothing at its core."
rotten,"Even with its heart in the right place, the sequel feels hamstrung with studio interference... the climatic finale battle was planned early on — and for all intents and purposes works exactly as it should — but getting there is a chore."
rotten,"With any superhero franchise, sequels usually implore their stories to move to a bigger and grander scale. That can sometimes cause the main essence of what made the original so great to be lost in translation."
rotten,"The movie feels like it's unfinished, missing every trick that comes along. And although the plot has potential, it bogs down as over-complicated mythology makes it oddly uninvolving."
fresh,"Though narratively less focused than the first film, it delivers the trademark humor, action, and heart of the franchise, resulting in a largely fun family film."
fresh,"Everyone who got a kick out of the low stakes, self-contained storytelling and goofily juvenile antics on display in 2019’s Shazam! will likely be equally satisfied with its sequel, Shazam! Fury of the Gods."
fresh,This sequel is not as satisfying a crowd-pleaser as the original but still delivers enough fun & laughs to make it worth seeing on the big screen.
rotten,"Fury of the Gods feels crammed, yet empty."
fresh,"It lacks the first film’s novelty value and throws away some of its innocence in a naff bit of product placement, but it retains the appeal of a comic-book tale that cares only about young viewers, not adult geeks."
fresh,"It's superficial and transparent, and the anecdote is clumsy and reiterative... but it's geared toward children and it may be a good time to watch with them. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It’s far from the worst superhero film we’ve seen in the past few years, and far from the best either. But it’s that relentless mediocrity that makes it frustrating."
rotten,"With one foot in comedy and the other in epic, [Shazam] doesn't know how to keep its balance.  [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,I thought the movie was delightful… it was really funny.
fresh,"Overall, what it makes for is a fun film."
fresh,"Billy’s inane babbling gets a little wearing, but the action sequences, featuring dragon-based mayhem, cyclopes and an army of formidable hell unicorns hopped up on candy, are pacy and fun."
rotten,"An undercooked casserole of cliched narrative elements, underdeveloped characters, juvenile humor, and a deus ex machina cameo."
rotten,"The heart and soul that made the first entry a success is missing this time around, in favor for a bigger, louder, and messier affair."
rotten,Shazam Fury of the Gods offers absolutely nothing new or needed in the current oversaturated super-hero abyss we current reside. Jack Dylan Grazer is the only bit of merit here.
rotten,"Like stablemate Black Adam, Shazam: Fury of The Gods thrashes around for a reason to exist, but only finds action scenes and quips. The customary credits scenes hint at a sequel, but this might be one hero that should get lost in the reshuffle."
rotten,"Bombastic and cacophonous, a relentlessly overstimulating carnival that relies heavily on CGI and a crushing and clanging soundtrack to fake its ambitious scale."
fresh,"Despite lacking so much of what made Shazam! great, there’s fun to be had with Fury of the Gods, a movie that serves as a reminder the DCEU wasn’t all bad. It’s just a shame it never quite manages to electrify us in the same way as its predecessor."
fresh,Shazam! Fury of the Gods benefits having the whole family be a big part of the film.
rotten,"Doesn't capture the magic of the first film, does a bad job of faking Philadelphia, and its ending is an insulting copout."
fresh,Finishes VERY strong [with] payoffs to emotional beats from the original that are highly appreciated.
rotten,Shazam! Fury of the Gods feels like a blatant attempt to recapture the financial success of the first Shazam film without any solid concept for a new storyline for the superheroes. It manages to lose what was great about the first one...
rotten,"There is plenty to like about Fury of the Gods but not terribly much to love, and that is where this film lies: in the distinct category of enjoyable, but forgettable films."
rotten,"As someone who really enjoyed the first Shazam, this sequel didn’t do it for me."
rotten,"At least it gave us Mirren, Liu and Zegler, a trio that everyone should wish for, livening up a by-the-numbers affair."
fresh,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods is as close as DC will ever get to the MCU formula, which is a shame since DC seems to treat the property like a joke. This sequel tops the original in nearly every sense, from story, to pacing, to overall action"
fresh,Lots of fun with bigger action sequences than the first but it had pacing issues in the 2nd act. Missed the magic of the emotional dynamic that was so present in the first film.
rotten,No one wants to see the venerable Dame Helen Mirren get body slammed.
fresh,The familial bond remains stronger than ever in a movie that’s not breaking the mold but follows the trajectory of its predecessor as a charming and delightful cinematic escape.
fresh,"A big and bubbly adventure overflowing with wisecracks, mythical creatures and, for the good people who have taken in so many foster children, an explanation for why their house keeps getting hit by lightning."
fresh,"Shazam 2: The Fury of Gods is more like a 90s family comedy than a superhero movie, and that's where it finds its charm. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Shazam returns with a generic, albeit harmless, sequel. It's fun entertainment that's only marginally less effective than its predecessor. Minimizing the ""kid as a superhero"" element for action scenes makes this indistinguishable from many other CB films."
rotten,"... In a drama this dumb and unaware, the buffed-up makeover seems like an insult to the same “inadequate” outsiders and weedy minorities the film pretends to champion."
rotten,"Unfortunately, the new sequel proves an adage: Lightning doesn’t strike twice."
rotten,"Too derivative from previous superhero films and too goofy to present believable characters, this movie is lost in the crack between DC slates."
rotten,"[Shazam! Fury of the Gods] strains too hard for laughs, which repeatedly tests the patience as gags fall flat with thunderbolt force."
fresh,"The charm of this movie relies heavily on Levi’s accidental superhero. He and his sidekicks bring an irreverent Gen-Z charm to the superhero template, and never take themselves or their apocalyptic predicament too seriously."
rotten,"The filmmakers have clearly asked themselves how to make the sequel bigger. Not better, mind you, just bigger. Well, it definitely is that. It's also fairly stale."
fresh,"The best thing about Shazam!  Fury of the Gods is that we get to know the other kids better, especially Jack Dylan Grazer, who plays Freddie Freeman"
fresh,"Shazam! The fury of the Gods invites all those DC characters, kind of the Justice League of losers, to play in a ball bit, before they're eviscerated by the new studio executives. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Fun, clever, smartly conceived entertainment that doesn’t take itself too seriously. What a concept."
fresh,"Fury of the Gods delivers a fast-paced, zesty four-colour concoction that, amongst the chaos and confusion, delivers some handy homilies on the importance of friendship, family and loyalty."
rotten,"Everything that worked in the original works less well in this so-so sequel, blunting even the star power emitted by its high-profile villains."
fresh,Shazam 2 recaptures a simpler and classic feeling of innocence that's reminiscent of the old comics... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Shazam! Fury of the Gods starts strong and falls apart across its bloated running time
fresh,But Shazam! Fury of the Gods creates the perfect canvas for that flight of imagination by helping kids from many walks of life and underrepresented groups see themselves on screen.
rotten,"Shazam! Fury of the Gods isn’t likely to inspire such titular rage in viewers, but that’s mostly because it isn’t doing enough to warrant any kind strong response at all."
fresh,"It’s just a fun, action-packed, heartfelt, great time at the movies."
fresh,"Even if this is the last iteration for the current Shazam film franchise, the filmmakers did manage two solid entries of a classic comic book hero. Fury of the Gods is not a great sequel, but it's still a fairly enjoyable one."
fresh,"As with the brilliant first outing, Shazam: Fury of the Gods revels in it, even when it is affectionately making fun of itself."
rotten,"Action-packed but weightless, 'Shazam! Fury of the Gods' tries to charm its way through a simple-minded sequel adventure."
fresh,"Thinly veiled beneath the powerhouse studio running the show, Disney's ""Tomorrowland"" is your new lightning rod between poignant and preachy.  It is, with absolute certainty, an enormous message movie hiding behind a summer blockbuster."
rotten,A movie about ideas and inventions that has too much of both...
rotten,"The story is simply too inconsistent, too uneven, and too flat."
rotten,"It's all very well-meaning, but the plot remains contrived because the filmmakers are more interested in delivering a message than a smartly crafted adventure."
fresh,"Outside of Bird's direction, his and Lindelof's screenplay and the acting, Michael Giacchino turns in yet another peppy, premiere score with heavy sci-fi influence and DP Claudio Miranda gives the film a robust look."
fresh,The ultimately simple charms of the film are more impressive and memorable than its more state-of-the-art trappings.
rotten,"Tomorrowland falls flat in promising what it's advertising, feeling more like concept art before a final film. Overflowing with optimism, it fails to feel genuine."
fresh,Tomorrowland wins my vote - a smarter than average science fiction thriller that poses metaphysical questions and wins.
rotten,"The much-hyped film itself feels overwhelmingly bland... I hope there are some young girls out there will take heart in seeing a heroic, science-loving teen girl onscreen. For everyone else, can I recommend staying home and reading Ursula Le Guin instead?"
rotten,The plot continues to scurry down the proverbial rabbit hole with greater and greater sci-fi strangeness - without an end in sight.
fresh,Raffey Cassidy is also quite the small wonder here.
rotten,"The aim of Tomorrowland is admirable, we can all use a more optimistic outlook, but the execution comes across like an unfocused, ham-handed, self-congratulatory editorial."
fresh,"'Tomorrowland' is a very enjoyable Disney adventure that, unfortunately, fails to have the necessary strength during its disappointing outcome. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It manages to surprise us, move us, keep us tense and leave us wanting to travel again to such a wonderful adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,And then it becomes WALL-E and turns into an agenda movie... It takes a hard left turn.
rotten,I think this might be more preachy than WALL-E.
fresh,The suspense and action scenes were fun and gripping.
rotten,It's a structurally muddled mess that manages to make flying around with a jetpack feel boring.
fresh,"A technical achievement, a visionary dream come true."
rotten,"Unfortunately, Tomorrowland goes nowhere, spoon-feeding us the same pile of moralizing crap that Disney has been peddling for decades and filling us with ennui while doing so."
fresh,Tomorrowland is an imaginative spectacle which delivers a world more memorable than the story told within it.
rotten,"If dreams can change the future, then maybe a first step towards Tomorrowland is finding alternatives to Tomorrowland and its action film heroic status quo."
rotten,A futuristic Disney fantasy in a choppy and tiresome narrative.
fresh,This is no doubt what Brad Bird set out to do: inspire viewers. And the film is fun.
rotten,"Unfortunately, it's a bit of a mess, meandering through much of its middle section without ever achieving the wonder it so desperately wants to achieve."
fresh,Tomorrowland may not be the perfect movie but this is the type of ambitious Disney film that I miss the most.
rotten,With a movie like this you have to feel emotionally connected to the characters and I didn't.
fresh,"Those who complain that the movie's message of conservation and push for innovation is less-than-subtle need reminding that Tomorrowland is a children's film, after all."
fresh,"This is a typically family-friendly jaunt from Disney that is as authentically sanguine as it is relentlessly entertaining, free from the constraints of the type of franchise loyalty that arrests the studio's other properties elsewhere."
fresh,"...there's not likely to be a zippier, dafter, more fascinating piece of family-friendly pop-art all summer."
rotten,"A preachy, low-stakes affair that only halfway delivers on its promise of shiny, futuristic spectacle; when the film's dreary central mystery story becomes its prime focus, fun falls by the wayside in favor of thinly veiled patronization."
fresh,"I enjoyed the film, flaws and all."
rotten,"A film that is about 95 percent exposition... The biggest problem with Tomorrowland is that once it starts to get going, it ends."
fresh,Exuberant adventures and boundless buoyancy makes it a dazzling and delightful treat.
fresh,"Seriously, the Disney film gets a bit preachy and that's a problem but with lots of action and cool stuff happening it's hard not to enjoy it nonetheless."
fresh,"Tomorrowland is mostly a film about ideas, and those ideas are definitely worth considering."
fresh,"Even though the film is a hair long, and there is a bit too much preaching in that final reel, Brad Bird's latest visionary opus spurred memories of an early Spielberg."
fresh,Cheerily puts the steering wheel in your own hands.
rotten,"The film begins at the Worlds Fair in Queens in the early 60's, and is actually quite engaging until it fast forwards to now. That's where things get uninteresting."
rotten,"Ultimately, however, a blockbuster summer film needs to be made like a good sponge cake: equal parts of jokes, action and story and this film for me didn't measure up in all areas."
rotten,"The energy in the beginning creates wonder and awe, but wanes tremendously. Attempting to bring that energy back at the very end is just too late."
rotten,"The more preachy and pious the film becomes, the more muddled and unexciting it starts to feel."
fresh,"Tomorrowland is such a bundle of good cheer, steering away from the cynicism that has been rendered commonplace by the type of summertime spectacles we have today."
fresh,"From jet-pack jaunts to Eiffel-Tower rocket launches, Tomorrowland is a visual treat, it's fun, fast-paced storyline harkening back to the Spielberg classics of the '80s."
rotten,"For a movie called Tomorrowland, there's not a lot of Tomorrowland."
rotten,"There is a good movie within, it just needs to embrace being adventurous rather than preachy."
rotten,"Tomorrowland is far from the worst blockbuster I've ever seen, which is the only thing I can really say in its favour."
fresh,Fresh. Spectacular. Engaging. Brad Bird's latest action adventure is all these and more.
fresh,"Tomorrowland risks being different from all the other films in the genre because it appoints, practically anoints, those who can change the course of history."
rotten,"This film is too complex to be kids' fodder, too saccharine-on-steroids to land with most adults, and too unconvinced of human potential to effectively spur most people to action."
fresh,"In the midst of a spate of blockbusters exploring the brokenness of man, it's nice to have one film that celebrates humanity's capacity for good, even if that film isn't perfect."
fresh,"But for families and those who want badly enough to believe in a beautiful future, Tomorrowland is a sugary slice of escapism."
rotten,"For those who prefer character development and cohesive storytelling, you may do better to watch some old episodes of ""Stargate"" or ""Sliders."""
rotten,"Is a future where all the world's awesome people get to live somewhere else, while us plebes have to stay on Earth doing our mediocre best really a future to aspire to?"
rotten,"The point of Tomorrowland is to encourage youngsters to think out of the box, stay positive and never give up. It's a sweet and inspirational message buried in a mire of cryptic plotting."
rotten,Wholesome adventure with a dash of agitprop for the kiddies.
fresh,"Director Brad Bird (The Incredibles) and co-screenwriter Damon Lindelof (that guy, co-creator of Lost, knows from disappointing people) never quite match the hope they clearly want to inspire."
rotten,"'Tomorrowland's' an 'addiction of geography' utopia movie, allowing us fantasies of exploiting resources on other planets since we've already hoovered up everything down here."
fresh,I wish -- oh how I wish -- it was a little bit better than it is.
rotten,"The aesthetics are easy to ape, but one should never underestimate the value Spielberg places on tight, clear, logical storytelling."
fresh,"In some ways, Tomorrowland feels like a tribute to Disney himself and even when it's getting preachy, it's hard not to be stirred by the message it's trying to send."
rotten,"From a filmmaker whose four features to date average a muscular 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, it all makes for an absolutely crushing defeat."
fresh,"It's an intriguing and ambitious science-fiction entry that, despite its flaws, still manages to serve up a pleasing family-friendly movie-going experience."
fresh,"It's a modestly successful, pure-hearted family blockbuster. The story doesn't really match its ideals in the end, but it's a fun enough ride while you're on it."
fresh,Bird takes the adolescent yearnings of kids raised up on pulpy Golden Age sci-fi and briefly gives them agency and texture.
rotten,The year's biggest letdown. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Tomorrowland is a folly and a failure, though there is something touching in its failure, tied as it is to the vision and personality of Walt Disney himself."
rotten,"Loving a future that used to be ""better,"" as Frank terms it, a future imagined before cynicism was pervasive (at least for cute white boys like Frank used to be), the movie is predictably incoherent. It wants an old future, one that's long gone."
rotten,"From the jump, Tomorrowland is devoted more to looking good than being good."
rotten,"[An] Übermensch philosophy melded with Disney's blue-sky, pixie-dust cheerfulness."
fresh,A solid film with unclear intentions and an apparent lack of a primary protagonist.
fresh,"...It's really nice to escape into the gleaming piece of chrome-ornamented optimism that is the Disney brand... but handcuffed by the happy ending edict, Tomorrowland hits a hollow note in its final frames as it beckons the big exit through gift shop."
rotten,"If you can get past its narrative muddle, really irritating dialogue and a plethora of unanswered questions, Tomorrowland offers a potent metaphor about the triumph of human hope and ingenuity. Wish it were enough."
rotten,"Tomorrowland boasts some excellent visual appeal, but sadly it does nothing to mask the multitude of faults found in the story, including a poor structure and a severely underwhelming conclusion."
fresh,The message of Brad Bird's latest is admirable and delivered well -- hoping to inspire young generations and shoot some life into the notion of optimism that cinema should really be all about.
fresh,There's so much great stuff in this movie that doesn't even remotely hang together.
fresh,Let's just say that the film is a self-reflective essay on the different way we look at the future in 2015 than we did in 1955. It also has some stern things to say about ignoring climate change -- in a very Disney sort of way.
rotten,"Tomorrowland is strong on character, action and a general sense of wonder, but it needs to take a good, hard look at itself when it comes to tying up plot strands in a satisfying manner."
rotten,"It's hard to say exactly who the audience is for this packed-to-the-brim, sci-fi/action-adventure/family romp."
fresh,Tomorrowland makes for a fun and exciting adventure.
rotten,The road to Tomorrowland is paved with good intentions that leave you wanting much more out of this beautifully designed science-fiction fantasy that expects more out of all of us if Earth is to survive.
fresh,"Bird's a consummate filmmaker. He's crafted a movie that celebrates exceptional people, prizes optimism over cynicism and ends with the idea that a better world is possible if we just try to find it."
fresh,"It is nice to see a summer family film, where, for a change, the emphasis is as much on thought-provoking story as it is on action."
rotten,"Hammering home its simplistic political messages as only Disney (and co-writer Damon Lindelof) can, director Bird's film has its moments, but mostly feels so yesterday."
fresh,"A grandly magical, if scatterbrained, vision of our future that's neither a time nor a place, but an idea."
rotten,One of the drawbacks to the film is the length. Director Bird seems so intent on dazzling the audience that he seems to have lost his watch.
fresh,Um filme que deve ser visto com olhos infantis.
rotten,"Tomorrowland is meant to be uplifting, and I came out of it thoroughly depressed."
rotten,"What we mostly get served is lazy writing, lazy storytelling and an obscene waste of money -- all to show us what a mess the world is in. We don't need a ticket to see that."
fresh,"Kids and teens should have a riot with the goofy robots, a neat small role by Key and Peele's Keegan-Michael Key and the fun action but adults expecting more will probably be slightly disappointed."
rotten,"It's slickly packaged, but below its surface Brad Bird's Tomorrowland is a preachy, chaotic jumble of themes and style at odds with itself from the get-go."
rotten,Tomorrowland concludes with as palpable a thud as one could possibly envision...
fresh,"Tomorrowland is co-written with Bird by Damon Lindehof, tapping a similar dimension-bending beat as his TV hit Lost. Like that puzzler, Tomorrowland's plot leads viewers down a few too many rabbit holes without carrots to show for it."
fresh,"An exciting look at the possibilities of the future and the necessity for determination, dedication and optimism to achieve it."
rotten,This is a fun and well crafted movie. The problem with Tomorrowland lies in its cuestionable and ideologically shady reflections on progress... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"When Bird's movie clicks, it's easy to believe that human intelligence and ingenuity can overcome impending global disaster. That's why he should have given his audience more credit and not spelled everything out for them."
rotten,Tries to save humanity from itself
fresh,"While Tomorrowland didn't reach its financial expectations, time will surely confirm its richness. Bird & Lindelof have created something quite remarkable, a rare gem amongst other treasures. Cherish it."
rotten,"Hollywood hastens its entropic slide with a dystopic children's story that lacks cohesion, logic, and even style."
fresh,'Tomorrowland' is an enjoyable mess of a movie that will appeal to Disney-philes and kids.
fresh,"hardly a perfect film, but it is a breath of fresh air amidst all the thoughtless destruction that seems to have become the de facto subject of most summer movies"
fresh,"A deeply personal blockbuster. It feels like actual human beings made it instead of some anonymous, corporate focus-group Marvel committee."
fresh,"With Athena the android replacing Clarence the angel, it's an 'It's a Wonderful Life' for the 21st century..."
fresh,"Director Brad Bird fills the movie with moments of brilliance, especially visually, but it falls apart in the final act and ends without a satisfying conclusion."
rotten,If only it didn't feel like Bird and Lindelof struggled to find a way to capture a fantasy utopia built by the best minds in a fashion that produced something new.
rotten,"Bird, usually a master of pacing (exhibit A: ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol""), here creates a laborious build-up to the action, and the exposition scenes stretch out with dull clichs."
fresh,"All of the ingredients of the film are there, and many parts of it are beguiling summer movie candy; it's just not a great story."
fresh,"I liked this film and I like its pro-science message of optimism. It is well-acted and the special effects are great, but the story, and its message are both over simplistic and muddled by side stories."
fresh,"It's not that the movie is bad, per se, but it's just so undisciplined ... It's like a one hundred and ninety million dollar improvisation."
fresh,"Contains enough plot mechanics and dazzling special effects to fuel a few summer blockbusters. The storyline may be too complex and mature for younger viewers. Adults and teens, however, will find much to appreciate and enjoy."
rotten,Tomorrowland proves too preachy for adults yet too confronting for children.
rotten,"Though it's not director Brad Bird's first retro-futuristic rodeo, Tomorrowland is his most stridently sermonizing."
rotten,"Put on a very simple level, ""Tomorrowland"" feels like science fiction grounded in Rev. Norman Vincent Peale's ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" -- minus the God stuff."
fresh,"Disney's beautifully designed, clumsily plotted movie muddle...Tomorrowland is the latest film to prove Disney's new-found mastery of meta-cinema, wherein they make films that are essentially about Disney products."
fresh,"I was hoping for more, but what it delivers is worth your time, and the butt kicking robot kid rules."
fresh,"The movie is a near-brilliant nexus of art, craftsmanship and marketing, painting a compellingly optimistic picture of the power of children and the young at heart to shape the future."
rotten,"However inspiring their Disney source material may have been, writer-director Brad Bird and co-writer Damon Lindelof have fashioned an uninspiring muddle of a movie."
rotten,.. Feels like a lot of build-up to a story the filmmakers don't care to tell.
rotten,"As a recruitment poster for dreamers and reformers, Tomorrowland falls short. As a movie event, it's the most dispiriting letdown of the season so far."
rotten,It's kind of like an Apple Watch - a new invention that's flashy but isn't practical or as impressive as it should be.
rotten,"What a weird-ass movie. It’s not really for kids, it’s not really for adults, it’s not really for anyone who enjoys Christmas."
fresh,Paul Giamatti's seemingly inherent playful moroseness adds a delightful dimension to the saintly Nick.
rotten,"Despite a great ensemble cast (which includes Paul Giamatti, Kevin Spacey and Rachel Weisz), this is one gift best left unwrapped."
rotten,"The biggest problem with Fred Claus isn't that it's not very good, it's that it pulls a bait-and-switch on parents expecting to see Hollywood's favorite bad boy in a film they can feel comfortable taking their kids to."
rotten,
rotten,"It's no improvement on Bad Santa, or National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, for that matter."
fresh,"Fred Claus will never go down in history as a holiday classic, or even one of Vaughn's better known films, but a sterling cast lifts up what could have been easy mediocrity."
rotten,"A turbulent ride that shifts tonal gears and messages like oscillations in the weather, ending in mythological frostbite."
rotten,"Fred Claus is not an entirely bad picture, but it is a decidedly bland one."
rotten,"Vaughn's act may be toned down a bit, but he still plays the same fast-talking, quip-spouting arrogant schmuck that he usually does, and it wears thin real fast."
rotten,"Rather than creating imaginative situations for Vaughn to explore, director David Dobkin merely asks that Vaughn be himself, as if his personality were big enough to wring humor out of a comic vacuum."
rotten,"Unfortunately, this is a broad family comedy that depends on odd sound effects (zonks! splat!) during every scene..."
rotten,Does it make me a Scrooge to suggest that this is one piece of holiday coal you should leave in your stocking?
rotten,"Fred Claus won't make us forget ""Rudolph,"" ""Frosty"" or even ""The Santa Clause."""
rotten,"It is a joyless rehash of old plots and jokes. File ""Fred Claus"" under lump of coal."
rotten,Paul Giamatti is forced to play Santa like a socially awkward version of Vince Vaughn
rotten,
rotten,"There are no laughs from the material, which wants to be edgy but can't go for broke because it's too busy being a trifling piece of holiday cheer but without the cheer."
rotten,"Fred Claus tries desperately for a Bad Santa meets Elf vibe. Five minutes in, the man sitting next to me was sound asleep."
rotten,"The actual effect of films such as this, however, is to put you in an entirely non-Christmas, non-joyous and non-charitable mood."
rotten,An archly mirthless comedy.
rotten,Fred Claus is in the grand tradition of a certain type of Yuletide farce - one that's about as funny as a crushed bauble in your egg nog.
rotten,The spirit of Scrooge surges strong within me having watched this chillingly cynical and unfunny Christmas movie.
rotten,You'll have a better time if you spend Christmas wedged up a chimney.
rotten,"This is one of those flicks that attempts to appeal to adults at a nudge, nudge, wink, wink, more salacious level while keeping the kids happy. It never really works."
fresh,"Dobkin's film is lit up by a couple of genius scenes: first, a siblings support-group attended by Frank Stallone, Stephen Baldwin and Roger Clinton; second, a superb in-joke triggering Spacey's redemptive thaw-out, stoking a festive glow against the odds."
fresh,"Fred Claus isn't especially funny but it's well made, superbly acted and entirely watchable, provided you can stomach the sentimentality levels."
rotten,"It creates a seasonal glow, but inconsistencies keep Fred Claus off the 'Nice' list this Christmas."
rotten,What seems like fertile comedy territory turns out to be as barren as the North Pole.
rotten,"While it tries to bring a new premise into the mix (Santa Claus has a cranky older brother), the result is just as humorless and stale as the Tim Allen's The Santa Clause trilogy."
fresh,"Vince Vaughn's famously rude Wedding Crasher gets macho with Ludacris as a m-igitalized feisty Santa elf, while huddling over the pint-sized urinals in the john with another, to clue him about North Pole dirty dancing and romance."
fresh,"Neither as terrible as it could be nor as funny as it should be, this is a painless way to catch a new holiday movie without getting into a fight about what part was the lamest."
rotten,Watching this kind of talent forced to muddle through this minefield of tired and embarrassing jokes is almost enough to make you reject the baby Jesus altogether.
fresh,There are plenty of cringe-worthy moments in this overlong seasonal tale ... but Fogelman and Dobkin do manage to find the right mix of sweet and sour.
rotten,A great cast fights a losing battle against moldy Christmas movie material in the holiday comedy Fred Claus.
rotten,"A neat idea badly executed. Early in the film, there are some funny bits, but by the end, the narrative completely loses its way. Without the weight of the personalities involved, the film would be quickly forgotten."
rotten,Vaughn is a funny guy in the right vehicle. This isn't it.
rotten,Reindeer roadkill.
rotten,"Look! It's the inevitable dance sequence where Vince teaches all the elves the lessons of Footloose, because if there's one thing you need on the toy assembly line, it's 'jazz hands.'"
rotten,A soulless concoction that's a joy-sinkhole for the whole family.
rotten,What is Ludacris doing in this movie?
rotten,"While the movie is often undeniably amusing, it's rarely funny."
rotten,"Ho-ho-ho-hum...here's the annual average holiday ""family"" film."
fresh,"A true Christmas classic to take the whole family to and enjoy. Put up your tree in anticipation of this film and get in the spirit, because this film will definitely cause you too."
rotten,"The movie is less ho-ho-ho than uh-oh, or oh-no."
rotten,There is absolutely no way writers were involved in the process that pooped out this holiday turkey.
rotten,Fred Claus is a large lump of coal in your pre-holiday stocking sure to give you a stomach ache after eating too much turkey.
fresh,"There are some scattered big laughs and a sweet message here, so I'm giving it a mild recommendation."
rotten,"Hlas, Fred Claus est aussi prvisible que la bouteille de Old Spice que l'on achte  papa..."
rotten,Don't make the mistake of misreading this mean-spirited production as a kid-friendly Christmas flick.
rotten,"With not even its excellent cast to recommend it, Fred Claus is an ill-conceived, charm-less film that will delight neither youngsters nor their parents. From tedium to schmalz, the film tries to be all things to everyone, and succeeds in none"
fresh,"Santa's mother, who obviously never heard of Dr. Spock, violates important childrearing advice in 'Fred Claus.' Amusing holiday chaos ensues."
fresh,I'm so glad there's another Fred movie. I've been getting Drop Dead Fred and Right Said Fred since I was in middle school.
rotten,"Fred Claus is pure Vince Vaughn hijinks, but the PG, family-friendly mode may not be his most advantageous venue."
rotten,A ho-ho-hum yuletide comedy trying to shoehorn Vaughn's fast talking wise-guy brand into a warm and fuzzy Christmas confection that seems like it has been focus-grouped to smithereens.
rotten,"The cast boasts three Oscar winners and two nominees. Normally, such a pedigree would guarantee great performances, at the very least."
rotten,"As derivative and predictable as any of the holiday comedies of the past few years, providing audiences with at best a handful of laughs. Most of it is uninspired."
rotten,"The story vacillates between broad, kid-friendly gags and a series of oddly sour riffs on the theme of adult sibling rivalry."
rotten,It senselessly dims an idea that should shine as brightly as Rudolph's nose.
rotten,"The film is a disaster, with an ending that is exactly the kind of schmaltz Vaughn usually makes fun of."
fresh,Vaughn gets plenty of mileage exploring both the painful and fun sides of Fred.
rotten,"It may not be a new holiday classic, but at least it's funny."
rotten,"A complete bust, derivative and uninspired, boring and dull, not funny, not moving and about a half hour too long."
fresh,"Fred Claus turns out to be not bad for a Santa movie, which I suppose could be interpreted as either faint or excessive praise, depending on your view."
fresh,"Friend, you may find yourself wondering how we ever survived the holidays without a Christmas dose of Vince."
rotten,"The satire on globalism and downsizing is also as old as the Clinton administration, but that doesn't stop director David Dobkin from selling it like fresh goods."
rotten,"Unable to sustain its one-note premise, the story foolishly revels in the mythology of Christmas to mask comedic vapidity. The trick doesn't work."
rotten,"There is more plot in the average Geico commercial, so the movie pads itself with detours into sketch ideas that don't develop past the basic concept."
rotten,About as funny as a sack of coal.
fresh,A pleasant little seasonal gift.
rotten,Ignore this piece of humbug.
rotten,"Come back Tim Allen, all is forgiven!"
rotten,"The movie's constantly shifting timbre takes some getting used to, and it's hard to escape the feeling that a whole lot of actors (Rachel Weisz, Kathy Bates, Miranda Richardson) are wasted in a whole lot of roles."
rotten,"It's more like a holiday fruitcake: a lot of different chunks of stuff -- some bitter, some sweet, some awful -- half-baked and sent to people low on the Christmas list."
rotten,An amiable but awkward Christmas bauble that depends too much on charm substituting for timing.
rotten,The eggnog quickly turns sour as the movie alternates between moments both heartwarming and bizarre.
fresh,"There's no more fleet talker flapping his lips with free associative aplomb than Vaughn, and he uses his edgy powers for good here."
rotten,"Award winners like Giamatti, Kathy Bates, Miranda Richardson, Kevin Spacey and Rachel Weisz struggle valiantly to elevate the material, but it's hopeless."
rotten,"Like so many secular, big-studio Christmas comedies, this isn't naughty enough to be funny or nice enough to be uplifting."
rotten,"If Vaughn is trying to test the family-film waters without abandoning his core audience, it doesn't work here."
fresh,[Vaughn's] naughtiness has never seemed so approachably nice.
rotten,The storytelling and focus are all over the map.
rotten,The idea that Santa Claus... is getting the life lessons and not giving them is the surest indicator of how crass this movie is.
fresh,"It may not be brilliant, but it's easily the best holiday movie since Elf..."
rotten,Paul Giamatti's oddly soulful turn as Santa stands out like a Christmas cookie atop a septic tank in this randomly plotted and intermittently amusing formula comedy.
rotten,"A generally fun movie as long as your expectations are low enough. But considering the talent of the cast and filmmakers, Fred Claus should be better (and funnier) than this."
rotten,"...far from the light-hearted, family-friendly comedy its promotional materials have been promising..."
rotten,"By the time it was over I'd already shrugged my shoulders, closed up my notebook and managed to inch a few seats closer to the door."
rotten,"The anemically kooky coal-in-the-stocking comedy feebly employs the same tactics. The toothless slapstick Fred Claus is merely ""ho ho ho"" and a bottle of dumb!"
rotten,"Here's the newest entry in that curdled genre, the I-Hate-Christmas movie."
rotten,"a passionless, crappy, made-for-TV-grade, sanitized feel-good fest"
fresh,"Fred Claus is the perfect post-millennial holiday film. It's funny, smart, wicked, warm, and above all, completely clued-in to our growing crass commercialization of Christmas."
rotten,Fred Claus is a tacky would-be comedy about family dysfunction that fronts some Scrooge attitude only to dissolve into slobbering sentimentality and canned uplift.
rotten,"Freely mixing reality therapy, fairy tale and satire, Dobkin's film does not maintain a consistent tone."
rotten,[Fred Claus] has apparently studied Elf and figured out everything that could have gone wrong with its fish-out-of-water Christmas fable.
rotten,Fred Claus ends up closer in spirit to Eugene O'Neill than it is to Dr. Seuss.
rotten,"The best children's stories are the simplest, and this one's a complicated mess."
fresh,A Santa story you've never heard before turns into a bright holiday package - filled with pure enjoyment for kids.
rotten,"Isn't there a verse in Revelations that proclaims when Tim Allen makes a funnier Christmas movie than Vince Vaughn, end times are a-comin'?"
rotten,
rotten,"David Dobkin directs with some sparkle, but without the sustained energy he brought to Shanghai Knights (2003) or Wedding Crashers (2005)."
rotten,"Fred Claus is like alump of coal, the kind of thing that no one in their right mind would possibly want to receive for Christmas and the kind of thing that could only be useful to people when set ablaze."
rotten,It's like they took the most tiresome elements of 10 different holiday films and patched them together into one ugly quilt.
rotten,"Boasting one of the least imaginative idea-to-execution screenplays to come along in memory, all the film has is some ad libbing from Vince Vaughn to keep the film afloat from the ill-inspired direction of David Dobkin."
rotten,"It's not offensive. It's not stupid. It will not cause you to go running out of the theater screaming, while holding your hands over your ears and eyes. It's just blah."
rotten,One wonders what made producer Joel Silver think this bizarre mix of incompatible genres would be a potential hit. Santa may have to skip his house for every winter holiday to come.
rotten,a fragile premise stuffed with hollow Christmas jokes
rotten,"Even though Vaughn knows how to build a pretty good performance out of little more than exasperated eye-rolling, he's just coasting here, and his scenes with Giamatti have no weight and no energy."
rotten,Fred Claus doesn't know if it wants to be naughty or nice.
rotten,Fred Claus wants to be both naughty and nice -- and still get some sort of present.
rotten,Bah. Humbug.
rotten,"This movie takes a good thing and runs it deep into the ground, leaving behind a frothy trail of sentimentality."
fresh,"If you must haul the kids to yet another annual (per)version of A Christmas Carol, you could do a lot worse than this cheeky, modestly edgy caper from Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin and screenwriter Dan Fogelman."
fresh,"Re-teaming with Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin, Vince Vaughn plays the eponymous character, Santa's crankier and considerably less charitable older brother, while doing all the riffing his PG straitjacket will allow."
rotten,An insipid Christmas comedy.
rotten,"How many laughs can one movie try to squeeze out of Vaughn being attacked by elves? Sadly, it's an awful lot."
rotten,"Holiday comedy's no classic, but it's OK for kids."
rotten,Joins the unsavory ranks of holiday entertainment that isn't entertaining and has little holiday cheer. This is a sinful missed opportunity for all involved.
fresh,"Vaughn is marvelous dancing with the elves, but plot digressions that take much too long to resolve and mangled special effects are a distraction and a nuisance."
rotten,"Fred Claus seems a clever installment, not a seasonal classic, a buffet whose many nibbles you sample, move on and quickly forget."
rotten,"Now You See Me may boast incidental pleasures courtesy of an all-star cast, but the film’s oft-repeated line “the closer you look, the less you’ll see” ultimately proves true."
rotten,"The story is riddled with plot holes. Some characters are so poorly written. The magic, which should be a strong point, won’t blow anyone’s socks off."
fresh,"The script plays fast and loose with logic and credulity and Letterier leans far more on CGI than old-school stagecraft magic, but the energy provided by Letterier’s driving pace and swirling cameras keep the film bouncing along..."
fresh,The magic isn't just confined to the vocation of the main characters in this complex and charismatic 2013 crowd-pleaser.
rotten,One of those films that tries to be too clever for its own good.
fresh,"This top notch cast manages to infuse the film with a sense of fun, style and a little suspense."
rotten,I wish I knew how to do magic. I think it would be a cool gift to have. My first trick would be to be to erase this film out of my head.
fresh,"Now You See Me is pure summer popcorn. While it's not a super movie, it is a rather entertaining diversion for a couple hours."
fresh,"It is risky, genius casting."
fresh,"An engaging little summer caper. With a talented cast and a twisty bit of storytelling, this is an adequate bit of entertainment that is enjoyable in the moment -- even if it is rather implausible if you think about it."
rotten,"The magic tricks are quite spectacular, especially one which features Ms Fisher floating above the audience in a giant bubble. But Now You See Me needed more sharpness for it be a really good film."
rotten,"Some will enjoy the show all the way to the final twist, but by the time the credits roll, you'll feel like Leterrier and his screenwriters ran out of top hats and rabbits and decided to saw their audiences brains in half."
fresh,"At a time when most mentally agile films are very talky and most action films have sing-along plots, Now You See Me is a surprisingly lively set of twists, turns, revelations and explosions."
fresh,Now You See Me is an entertaining trick for the eyes.
fresh,Now You See Me is a rarity: a summer movie that manages to entertain without killing off a single of its viewers' brain cells.
rotten,"A film that relies on one of the worst, if not the worst twist in cinema history, and literally erases everything that it builds up to."
fresh,"Now You See Me is fun but flawed summer fluff. There are certainly moments of greatness here, but the execution falters too many times."
rotten,"However, the film sacrifices true depth of characterization of its leads in its quest to be purely entertaining, and the film suffers as a result. We are left rooting for-and against-a series of charming façades."
fresh,"It gives you a little taste of both kinds of tricks. If you are looking for fun that involves more of the mind and a little less of the explosive kind, [Now You See Me] is the film for you."
rotten,"""Why?! Why?!"" screams Morgan Freeman and you, the viewer."
fresh,It's a fun set-up with a terrific cast - [Jesse] Eisenberg plays against type as a smooth-talking card trickster while [Woody] Harrelson radiates easy charm as a mentalist and serial flirt.
fresh,"Force-fed magic is fun for a while, then it fizzles out along with our complicity to believe."
rotten,"With the classic magician's tactic of misdirection, Now You See Me gets us to look at all the explosions, car crashes and pretty people while concealing that the magician's hat is empty and his cards are clearly marked."
rotten,"Like a car that all at once blows its transmission, loses power steering, succumbs to a flat tire, and catches fire, ""Now You See Me"" is a wreck in every sense of the word."
fresh,"Now You See Me is a slick crime caper that works because of its witty dialogue & large cast, but falls flat due to a finale that fails to leave any sort of magical impression"
fresh,"Clever, original, wildly improbable, wildly enjoyable and directed with all the necessary flash and dazzle, the film combines the pleasure of a well-engineered heist movie with a twisty-turny plot full of wit, double-takes and sleight-of-camera."
fresh,"This surprisingly witty, deliciously well-played and sneakily subversive outing from director Louis Letterier freaks out a little into its final act but, nevertheless, ranks as one of the year's most entertaining pics."
fresh,"Like a real magic show, Now You See Me is thoroughly entertaining for the most part, but is ultimately silly and substanceless."
fresh,"If you are going to avail yourself to two of hours slight of hand and slippery conjuring, you are going to have to be willing to believe the unbelievable to fully enjoy the show."
fresh,Abracadabra! The character development has vanished! But the flowers are still standing!
rotten,"The opening credits roll, the stage is set and then SHAZAM... all sense of logic magically disappears."
rotten,Ocean's Eleven for Gen-Y; it's a 'pop heist movie' that's more concerned with looking cool than being it.
fresh,"Seductive with its opening magic show delivering fabulous illusion, Now You See Me has a bit of Ocean's 11 at its heart. It's somewhat darker, and it's that darkness that gives it texture"
fresh,"A hugely enjoyable thriller, whose sleight of hand is both audacious and ambitious, Louis Leterrier's film is considerable in scale and daring"
rotten,Hollywood bombast masquerading as something trickier.
fresh,Now You See Me puts the fun back in being fooled.
fresh,"If you look at the film as escapist fare where you just go: 'My brain's off, you got a good cast, you got a good concept, roll with it' -- I think you'll be fine."
rotten,"Audiences go to magic shows to get fooled, but that doesn't mean they want to leave feeling cheated."
rotten,"The story moves jauntily toward its destination; the destination, unfortunately, is a disappointing wreck."
fresh,"Surprisingly delightful audience entertainment, unburdened by overzealous special effects and loud soundtrack cues and driven by a story that, well, just likes the idea of being smart."
fresh,"Now You See Me is a picture that lays all of its cards on the table, only to uncover one or two jokers in the pack."
rotten,A fairly unmagical couple of hours at the cinema.
fresh,"The idea of magicians conducting a series of heists is a great one, but this under-developed film never quite seizes the opportunity. Even its terrific A-list cast can't make much of the lame plot."
fresh,Ignore the gaping plot holes and Now You See Me all comes together in gloriously silly fashion.
fresh,"Implausible climax aside, this fast-paced, fizzy summer blockbuster leaves us with food for thought."
fresh,This is a film about razzle dazzle composed entirely - and appropriately - from razzle dazzle.
rotten,"A flashy heist thriller about a quartet of bank-robbing magicians, Now You See Me boasts surface dazzle and foxy sleight of hand, but when its makers reveal their narrative tricks you'll more likely shrug than gasp with awe."
fresh,"Most of it makes no sense at all, but who cares? This is cheerful ridiculousness pulled off with panache."
fresh,It entertains.
rotten,"Overcooked, overcomplicated and underinteresting, this heist caper turns into a mess."
rotten,Leterrier handles his camera like a Swingball set. Sleight-of-hand has seldom felt slighter than this.
rotten,"Despite decent performances, this is a hugely disappointing, poorly conceived and badly directed thriller that ultimately fails thanks to the sheer contempt it displays for its audience."
rotten,A glossily superficial yarn that elicits a shrug and a resigned 'meh' rather than awed incredulity.
rotten,"A film which proves the theory that if magicians were also bankrobbers, they'd still be pretty stupid."
rotten,When the smoke finally clears you won't hear a single gasp. The groans could be deafening though.
rotten,"Bustling, glittery, uninvolving."
fresh,"There are so many twists, turns and 'shocking reveals' that we're soon bogged down by a top-heavy narrative that then collapses with a final reversal that's only stunning in its sheer ridiculousness."
rotten,"This flashy, flat, dispiritingly personality-free drama is more likely to make audiences disappear."
fresh,"Magicians as criminals is a marvellous conceit and Louis Leterrier gets a great deal of entertainment out of it, but it can't disguise a weak end with smoke and mirrors."
rotten,Complicated nonsense about four professional magicians caught up in an elaborate revenge plot.
rotten,"There is no-one quite so smug as a magician enjoying the bafflement of the crowd and this alleged thriller, about a rogue team of illusionists, is full of it."
rotten,"It can't cover up its weak finale with sleight of hand. Still, 'Now You See Me' puts on a nice show, particularly in its first half."
rotten,"If you see only a handful of movies a year you'll probably love it. If you see one every weekend, you're going to demand smarter illusions than this film can muster."
rotten,...a missed opportunity that never lives up to its strong opening...
rotten,"It has all the depth of a Vegas magic act, though take heart, it's one fifth of the price."
fresh,...the plot of Queen Latifah and Katie Holmes' 'Mad Money' is more doable.
fresh,An intriguing premise wrapped in mystery that takes the audience into unexpected outcomes and pleases along the way.
fresh,This will be one of Summer's top blockbusters. Experience the magic and See it Now.
fresh,"...the illusions, as presented, are spectacular."
fresh,This will be best enjoyed by those willing to be hoodwinked along with the characters.
fresh,"I love magic, and films about magic, like 'Houdini,' 'The Prestige' and 'The Illusionist.' This is a film about magic. Although it is pretty high tech, a lot of the magic tricks in it are very traditional, based on trickery and misdirection."
fresh,It's only during the too-long finale that the wheels fall off and the script reveals itself to be not as smart as it pretends to be.
rotten,The movie initially dazzles but ultimately succumbs to the Houdiniesque straitjacket of its increasing implausibility.
fresh,Possible - But Is It Real
fresh,"While it runs a little long, the fine acting by the outstanding cast and the high production values make this an entertaining trip."
fresh,The enthusiasm and bouncy energy with which the film rockets through its plot... are enough to keep it peppy and fun despite how utterly shallow and trivial it is.
rotten,"Although Now You See Me lures us with its razzle-dazzle, the film really has little up its sleeve."
rotten,"There's flash, energy and an exciting chase sequence. There's also much to do about magic tricks that aren't so enchanting."
fresh,The brilliant heist caper and the fascinating realm of illusion blend flawlessly in the summer's most intelligent film...
fresh,It was fun while it lasted.
rotten,Leterrier's sixth feature film relies so heavily on the flashiness of a great show that the characters become props whose motives and storylines disappear amidst all the smoke and mirrors of the movie.
fresh,I didn't care all that much about the implausibility or plot holes because the movie is start-to-finish fun.
fresh,"A slick little cat-and-mouse caper wrapped around a novel idea, and the likeable cast runs with the fun."
fresh,Makes up in razzle-dazzle what it lacks in intelligence.
fresh,A surprisingly enjoyable look at the world of magicians and what goes on behind the scenes.
fresh,The real trick is going to be pulling the ticket price out of the audience's pockets for this handful of smoke.
fresh,"A uniquely cool mix of actors. While it does have some flaws there is enough here to warrant a viewing, maybe even a 2nd just to see if everything hangs together once you know the reasons why - it get extra points for not being in 3D."
rotten,"To be fair, Now You See Me is only nominally about super slick magic. It's really a super slick caper movie."
rotten,"The final act reaches up its sleeve and pulls out a big twist that's supposed to take us by surprise - but, instead, just takes us for idiots."
rotten,A messy magic act dominated by Eisenberg who once again shows off his amazing skill at memorizing long monologues
rotten,About as thrilling as watching a movie about a white rabbit come out of a magician's hat.
fresh,"Smart casting, agreeable performances and a fresh narrative backdrop power this facile, twisty treat, helmed by Louis Leterrier."
rotten,"The structure requires a lot of patience to see through to the end, and the lack of an actual reason to care about the game ... [tests] that patience."
rotten,"It's true...The closer you look, the less there is to see."
rotten,"The movie is nothing more than an empty spectacle hopelessly riddled with gaping plotholes, narrative coincidences and a final twist that couldn't have been more preposterous had it revealed that Chewbacca was actually Luke's father."
fresh,"An intriguing escapade, revolving around a magician's deliberate misdirection, as in 'The more you look, the less you see.'"
rotten,begins with a giddy sense of mischief and ends with a contrivance that bespeaks the desperation of failing to plan for a proper ending.
fresh,You have some fun along the way.
rotten,Characters acting falsely just to fool some imaginary 3rd party who may be looking on like The Purple Rose of Cairo is as bad as a living room magician from pre-school telling their spectators to close their eyes while they hide the ball. Only not as cute
rotten,"The characters are sketchily drawn, so the success of this film depends almost entirely on the storytelling, which is exceptionally cluttered"
fresh,"Now You See Me is a fine disposable summer movie. It has a lot of flash, but that's magic."
fresh,"Pure summer movie magic - literally. More fun than Ocean's 11, 12 and 13 combined. You won't believe you eyes - and that's the point."
rotten,Now not as Magical as it Wants to be
fresh,"If you're interested in a suave demonstration of cinematic showmanship (no more, but no less), then you might want to consider giving Now You See Me a look."
rotten,"The movie finds a bit of redemption in its excellent cast, who do what they can with the lacklustre script. But in the end, what Now You See Me is missing is simply that ineffable spark called magic."
rotten,"If you're OK with the film playing you for a sap, you'll laugh and clap and wonder how that bird got into that hat. But if you think there's a difference between being tricked and being cheated, you may feel swindled."
rotten,"Leterrier also tries to pack an extraordinary amount of story and twists into a fairly ordinary running time, resulting in editing so choppy that sometimes even the easy parts are hard to follow."
fresh,Seems far too clever to be a summer release--those who enjoy fun heist movies should appreciate how unique this one is from others.
fresh,Teen-appealing heist movie has a few brutal fight scenes.
rotten,"This would-be ""Ocean's Eleven"" of the magic world remains watchable throughout, even as it plods along without ever quite fulfilling its potential."
fresh,"Aaron Spelling-style mindless entertainment, what they used to call a B-movie, with a lot of narrative holes to fill for an active-minded viewer. That's tantamount to going to see a magic act with a debunker's frame of mind, though"
rotten,One of those movies with a terrific premise and a less-than-terrific follow-through.
rotten,"Does a great injustice to the skill of misdirection by turning elaborate deception into blunt blockbuster filmmaking, perverting sleight of hand beauty into moronic CGI-drenched escapades where anything goes."
rotten,"Boasting a terrific cast and a flimsy plot whose logic disappears faster than a rabbit in a hat, Now struggles to pull off its cinematic sleights of hand."
fresh,"Plenty of cinematic subterfuge is needed to keep this high-speed heist act in the air, but it's a fun ride if you don't look where you have been or where you are headed."
rotten,It's a cheat even before taking a last-minute excursion into a more fantastical genre.
rotten,"Not much magic here. Sometimes a great twist ending can make up a lot of lost plot ground, but even the end twist of Now You See Me is mundane."
fresh,"Good light summer fun, but frustrating. The Four Horsemen should have been the focus rather than Mark Ruffalo's cartoonishly dogged FBI agent."
fresh,"Has an appealing comic spirit, and it's a considerable amount of fun, in parts."
rotten,"There's nothing behind all this sturm und drang but a lineup of insubstantial ciphers, all false fronts and empty words in a pretend world not quite conducive to emotional investment."
rotten,Shyamalan’s efforts to stretch this into 108 minutes leaves far too many dull lapses.
fresh,A HORRIFYING Concept that will have you leaving the theater contemplating your life & the time you spend in it!
rotten,"Old is one of those cases of a remarkably unique, intriguing concept failing to reach its potential due to an overall disappointing execution of too many ideas."
fresh,"Questionable conclusions aside, you still can’t deny the beautiful simplicity of Old’s concept or the cast’s stellar performances throughout the feature."
rotten,"...Old fails to live up to its potential because of its half-baked, poorly written characters"
fresh,"That pitch and pace unfortunately does the ensemble cast no favors, all of them struggling mightily to deliver some of the clunkiest dialogue of Shyamalan’s career."
fresh,"Though Old has a number of observable shortcomings, my overall impression of the film that sticks with me is that of excitement and amusement."
fresh,"Shymalan’s latest is compellingly perverse and wracked with a real sense of menace, making its hopeful denouement something of a betrayal."
rotten,Quite beautiful and very stupid.
fresh,"“Old” sees Shyamalan once again blending the supernatural with the real world to make something that’s uniquely his own. Not everyone will be onboard, but I was."
rotten,Add Old to the unrealised potential column of M Night Shyamalan's filmography.
rotten,The director’s latest reconfirms my original sentiments that M. Night Shyamalan is a one-trick pony who isn’t the most exciting filmmaker.
rotten,"""Old"" is wildly inconsistent, preventing it from ever being genuinely as good as some of the director's better works such as ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" or ""Split."""
rotten,"Old's breakneck pacing once things start going south leaves little room to delve into character and personal relationships, or feature enough quieter flashes that would have helped to create sympathy for these people we've not long met."
fresh,iOldi represents the sort of solid mid-range thriller that use to litter the multiplexes 25 years ago.
rotten,"Try as it might, Old doesnt live up to its trailer, nor does it stand tall against some of Shyamalans other films."
rotten,"What is clear, however, is that Old is nowhere near the project many were hoping it would be and will leave many audience members and long-time Shyamalan fans shaking their heads."
rotten,Shyamalan remains more invested in setting the hook than reeling in his audience.
fresh,"While far from a masterpiece, Old is an entertaining thought exercise from one of Hollywoods most invigorating filmmakers."
fresh,"Old delivers on its buildup of tension, although it struggles to engage on a dramatic level."
fresh,"""Old includes familiar Shyamalan trademarks mixed in with some new tricks."""
fresh,Fearsomely compelling until the final unnecessary 'twist' transforms a terrifying metaphor about the pitilessness of old age into what seems to be a pitch for a cable sci-fi series.
rotten,"it was a snooze...I don't recommend it, I wouldn't watch it and I wouldn't waste the time."
rotten,"At least I wasn't bored. But it wasn't great. I at least had fun laughing at the nonsense. It didn't feel like a cash grab or truly lazy, except for the writing..."
rotten,"Shyamalan's movie was too timely, an obvious and exact mirror of pandemic life over the previous year and a half..."
rotten,"Performances tend to be emphatic, sometimes too much so. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,As brilliant as it is perfectly idiotic. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Half-baked and bogged down by subtext, the high concept Old fritters away its intriguing potential by dispensing too little explanation in its trouble-in-paradise vacation plot."
fresh,"Old is frustrating, Old is foolish, Old is fun, and Old just has to be the so-bad-it's-good movie of the year."
fresh,A great movie that is an island unto itself. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"With its sub-par storytelling, lapses in logic, and generally dull plotting, Old represents another failed outing for struggling writer/director M. Night Shyamalan."
rotten,"""Old"" takes an intriguing premise that had the potential to grow and land with an impact and plays it safe with its characters and ending."
fresh,"Shyamalan's big ideas are always a fun labyrinth to explore, and 'Old' throws in some excellent, twisted horror to boot."
fresh,"...while super-slick, and certainly good to look at, Old is a remorselessly sick and disturbing film..."
rotten,"Shyamalan has garnered a reputation for twists and turns that has regularly come off onscreen as a professional burden rather than an artistic choice - a sick, unfortunate game of catch up by a director once heralded as the next filmic pioneer."
fresh,"Of course, there's a twist, but this isn't a typical M. Night Shyamalan movie, so it's not dreams or aliens or a ship in a bottle. It's modern and altruistic in the only way Chaotic Good can be."
rotten,"Nobody can accuse M Night Shyamalan of pulling punches, but what if viewers are the ones being punched?"
fresh,"It's kind of like a B-minus Twilight Zone premise writ large and outlandish, with a bit of mediocre soft-core body horror mixed in there for good measure."
rotten,The film tries to pretend that its central gimmick has not been given away by its posters and trailers. It is frustrating to watch characters stumble in the dark for so long.
fresh,Who else would create a character called Mid-Sized Sedan and expect to be taken seriously?
rotten,M. Night Shyamalan delivers a movie full of cool ideas that don't age well.
rotten,"If you're going to make me wait 90 minutes for a worthy finale, at least give me interesting characters to care about in the lead up."
rotten,"It's all absurd, and the twist at the climax doesn't necessarily make things better, but maddeningly worse"
fresh,"While the film does start off a little uneven, it flies fast and fierce once the plot kicks in, turning into a fun and frightening thrill ride."
fresh,"Doesn't rank among M. Night's finest, but has enough interesting ideas, compelling characters, and disturbing moments to keep genre fans happy."
rotten,"When the end credits finally begin, you too will be wondering if your past (hour and forty-eight minutes) could have been better spent."
rotten,"If 'Old' stuck to the rooting themes within the confines of its smaller story, the overall premise would have landed better."
rotten,"Insufficiently developed characters, awkwardly acted scenes, embarrassing dialogue: M. Night Shyamalan has made some awful movies in his day, but Old is one of his worst."
fresh,"Shyamalan is a maker of moods, and often a master of them, capturing unease and slow-settling fear with sounds and images and... that prowling Shyamalan camera of gentle portent, before it all comes crashing down. (In momentum, there is grace.)"
fresh,A compelling premise accompanied by great performances. I loved the twist & left me thinking about time and how we utilize it.
fresh,"Shyamalan excels in creating and sustaining an unsettling atmosphere... However, Old lacks any emotional introspection about human mortality, save for a fleeting moment of reconciliation between Bernal and Krieps."
fresh,"Old is an imperfect movie, one with its share of lows. However, those lows are outnumbered by the highs ... unsettling and creepy, beautifully shot and weirdly visceral. You know - an M. Night Shyamalan film."
rotten,"Though there are moments of pulse-quickening body horror, the film's pace is mostly sluggish, with telegraphed plot revelations and flubbed emotional cues piling up like flotsam."
fresh,"OId was very much M. Night channeling his inner Rod Serling, crafting a weird and wonderful tale of the unknown that feels plucked from that era of the late 50s TV fare."
rotten,"Sadly, despite those high stakes, the tension rarely reaches a boiling point, let alone a sustainable simmer."
fresh,Aging has never been more frightening but fun
fresh,Mid-tier Shymalan offering with a few fleeting moments of effectiveness.
fresh,...an almost prototypically uneven Shyamalan effort that undoubtedly (and ultimately) exploits its oddball setup to its full potential...
rotten,"Despite its interesting premise, it fails to find the right balance between the seriousness of its existential themes and the absurdity of some of its turns. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"M. Night Shyamalan's psychological thriller successfully evokes an existential sense of dread and ultimate acceptance of human mortality. But it's marred by a jarring final twist that feels so forced, it almost belongs in an entirely different movie."
rotten,The story doesn't always stitch together because the characterisations are fleeting.
fresh,"OLD is very successful at what it has attempted to do and stands as the first Shyamalan film that has managed to really scare me. It is a beautiful film that has a fair amount of ugliness in it as well, as it should."
fresh,You still have in Shyamalan an astute chronicler of the human condition.
rotten,"An unexplained force prevents folks from fleeing the sandy cove, sort of like Luis Bunuel's ""The Exterminating Angel,"" albeit less existential."
fresh,"Old is the rare M. Night Shyamalan movie where he doesn't swing for the fences; instead, it is a mid-tier science fiction thriller with some interesting body horror moments and something moderately interesting moral quandaries at the end."
rotten,"It is interesting, but definitely walks a tight rope and I imagine some viewers having enough. It would've worked better as a short."
fresh,"""Old"" is a fiendish idea only partially realized."
rotten,Good plot twist but it gets old before the movie ends.
fresh,"Shyamalan doesn't always seem to have as firm a grasp on his recent screenplays as he did early in his career, but ""Old"" offers some summer thrills at the movies."
fresh,"Literalizes the adage about how life passes you by in a flash, to horrifying effect."
fresh,"In macro, the film explores pandemic-era anxieties about the corporate entities that hold life-or-death sway over society, but it's on the micro level that I found myself moved."
fresh,It's a breathtaking ride that only Shyamalan could dream up.
fresh,Old once again proves Shyamalan's sharp eye for out-of-the-box concepts which he can singularly turn into a haunting cinematic feat. But his sloppy writing consistently takes away from its full potential.
fresh,Shyamalan is aware of the power of the concept and how well it suits his obsessions. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,The director knows how to handle tension throughout the story very well. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"At least one snippet of dialogue works: ""Are you sure we have time for this?"" That would be a hard no considering how many worthwhile horror films are available for streaming."
rotten,"In over-complicating his stories, he sabotages himself with unruly scripts that have fascinating thematic cores but messy dialogue and divisive endings. Old is sure to either enamor or enrage audiences, which is what Shyamalan does best."
fresh,"Not Shyamalan's best, but with some influence from Hitchcock and the Twilight Zone, it succeeds at making the viewer uncomfortable, and opens up an internal conversation about life, death and the meaning of it all."
rotten,"It's ""Cocoon"" in reverse with good actors doing bad work in service of a beach day gone fatally awry."
rotten,"If we can't believe the characters, how are we meant to accept the film's central premise?"
rotten,"It's so off-putting and goofy that it seems purposeful, as if everyone involved was trying to sweep next year's Razzies."
fresh,"Shyamalan mixes stints of body horror with the film's existential woes, all while deploying Mike Gioulakis' constantly careening cinematography to convey the confusion sweeping through his exasperated characters."
fresh,"The mystery of why certain people end up in that beach is uncovered and it has a surprisingly logical explanation within the confines of the storyline. If you're into intriguing premises and willing to suspend disbelief, you may dig Old."
rotten,"Old isn't going to change anyone's mind about Shyamalan if they aren't a fan of his work, but the sheer audacity of some of the choices are entertaining even though it has a myriad of technical issues with the script."
rotten,Shyamalan continues to be the one who picks the best piece of fruit off the tree and then just throws it into the ocean because he has no idea what to do with it.
rotten,"Old can't really even fall back on being just a silly entertaining genre romp like The Visit, because its narrative arch is emotionally sterile."
rotten,"When Shyamalan spills all, we realize this isn't worth the time it takes to play out. If this is a reminder to make the most of every day, it easily could have been delivered back at the hotel pool. With a drink."
fresh,"In Old, Shyamalan is pumping on all cylinders: it's as good a film as he's made."
fresh,"Old hurtles along, and once the characters are stranded on the beach, there is no real let-up to the dread."
rotten,"The resolution here is needlessly drawn out, and calls on the audience to accept a lot on faith that Shyamalan's talent for deception hasn't really earned."
rotten,"As a piece of filmmaking, M. Night Shyamalan's Old, a thriller set on a tropical beach, is a one-star movie. Yet it scores better if we switch to the should-I-see-it? indicator."
rotten,Old is wickedly cool concept gone awry
rotten,"The book's mysteriousness is much of what lends it a peculiar power, but Shyamalan dispenses such esoterics in favor of a ham-handed approach that better fits his own, overly explicable filmmaking impulses."
rotten,This is a bit of a flop. I'm not feeling Old. Save your two hours and watch something else.
rotten,"Unless Madonna makes a screen comeback or there's a Cats 2 in the works, this year's Razzie Awards are already a lock."
rotten,"While the main plot is a bit tiresome, the twist is impressive"
rotten,"Old abandoned its more interesting potential early, to embrace nonsensical plot elements that are riddled with internal inconsistencies."
fresh,"An effective and deeply unnerving work of existential terror that, for 80-some minutes of its runtime, holds its own with the highlight reel of the oft-maligned-yet-oft-masterful career of its director."
fresh,A fine yet messy thriller.
rotten,"""What's old is new again"" is a pretty apt tag for this M. Night Shyamalan outing that, like many of the director's quirky thrillers, rides a long tease of ""What the heck's going on here?"" before a big gotcha reveal in the final act."
fresh,"Old may be baffling, even frustrating at times, but it's always highly watchable and compelling."
fresh,[Inconsistencies aside]... I contend that the film's imagery is powerful and disturbing enough to overlook these details. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,Shyamalan proves to have far surpassed his teachers. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Despite the frustrating circular premise, ""Old"" proves to be compelling."
fresh,Each technical element is expertly used to create an overwhelming sense of terror that feels like it is gradually melting your mind with every passing minute. Shyamalan's flowing camera work deserves note for how unhinging it is.
rotten,"By the time the twist came, everything seemed past its goddamn expiration date, and I could only ponder an ancient question that seems to have no answer: why is Shyamalan still allowed to do s--t like this?"
fresh,"Following in the steps of other low-budget thrillers that Shyamalan has directed since he stepped away from the world of franchises, Old is distinctly Shyamalanesque in its mix of weirdness, terror, and philosophy."
rotten,"The characters are quirky, but trust us, not in a good way - in an annoying, instantly tedious, I-dare-you-to-care-about-me way."
rotten,Rarely have I felt more like my life was slipping away in the cinema.
fresh,"When compared to his recent movies like Glass and Split, it's still eerily spare, a mode that suits him well. And the moments when Old is cranking into high-concept gear are fun to watch and disquieting."
rotten,It is easy to admire... it would be even easier if the execution wasn't dismal.
rotten,"Old starts to get old pretty quickly, since Shymalan doesn't do more than set up situations and then film them in a very manic, foreboding way."
rotten,"Old refers not just to the fate of the characters but it describes the creaky, tired feel of the film."
fresh,"Another brain-bender from M Night Shyamalan, this film grips the audience with a sense of foreboding even before the freak-outs begin to roll in."
fresh,"Though never shy about its origins in a schlocky, high-concept premise, it's Old's eagerness to wring the most from it that ultimately frees it -- specifically, to turn on a dime between laughs, thrills, and quiet contemplation."
rotten,"The film is a hoot, even if it is for all the wrong reasons -- I laughed quite a lot when I shouldn't have -- but I would have liked some logic. Any logic. Internal or external, but there truly isn't any."
rotten,Old will age you.
fresh,Shyamalan's gift for misdirection - amplified here by virtuoso camera work - makes his characters' collective predicament horribly compelling.
fresh,"The thing is, there's nothing particularly ""scary"" about Old, but as far as creating an unsettling feeling of oppressive dread, Shyamalan does a great job of achieving just that with his latest cinematic endeavor."
rotten,"Old is all concept and no character. Once the premise has been established, Shyamalan seems at a loss for what to do with it; for a film in which the years run away with themselves, the sensation here is one of killing time and treading water."
fresh,"…Mafia Mamma’s flaws aren’t hard to see, but as an undemanding evening time-passer, it just about reworks the old Bob Hope fish-out-of-water/American abroad trope to passable effect…."
rotten,"The romance is thin, the comedy lacking and the overall story is incredibly exaggerated but Mafia Mamma is a fun holiday for the mind."
rotten,Bellucci looks as if she is thinking about something else in every scene. It isn’t long before you’re doing the same.
fresh,"Collette's comic timing is exemplary, and Monica Bellucci shines as the Cosa Nostra's ultra-cool consigliere, but a few faint-hearted viewers may be shocked by some of the more over-the-top violence."
rotten,"The constant references to The Godfather and the characters’ utter disappointment in Kristin’s lack of knowledge of the film is a running gag, which might be exhausting to some viewers."
rotten,Mafia Mamma doesn’t know how to blend elements into a seamless whole and that makes for a piece that has some exciting flashes but lacks the ability to weave together something that is interesting and sustainably entertaining.
rotten,"The blending of action and comedy for the most is inconsistent, and the film never nails either genre – unlike the gold standard, “The Spy Who Dumped Me” (2018), which delivered seamless action and laughs."
rotten,"The final result isn’t a felony of fail, but it is more than a misdemeanor of a missed opportunity."
fresh,Mafia Mamma sustains itself on its funny Collette and Bellucci duet. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Mafia Mamma never quite manages to find the right tone, and instead gets bogged down in its attempt to be a dark comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Even if nothing is even remotely believable, it's still undemanding fun."
rotten,"The running joke that nobody has seen The Godfather is an apt metaphor for everyone involved with this who have clearly not even seen any of the bad mob comedies that run roughshod over this violent, assault-filled wannabe."
rotten,"Mafia Mamma is a throwback to the turn of the century The Sopranos-inspired movie comedies like Analyze This and Mickey Blue Eyes. However, the script is too light on humor, too heavy on gratuitous violence, and too lazy on character cliches to enjoy."
rotten,"The juxtaposition of banality and extreme violence is supposed to be humorous, but it’s merely shrill and miscalculated, an attempt at farce that’s farcical in itself."
rotten,"...a silly screwball comedy attempt with Toni Collette giving an inept Lucille Ball imitation...Even with talent, it would take a thaumaturge to make something of this bunkum."
rotten,"[Hardwicke] amasses little jokes as if they were innovative, loiters her story with the very same clichés she's trying to parody, and reduces her characters to stick figure sketches of predictable ideas... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Because if there is something that the script does not lack, and that the direction of Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight) reinforces, is that if you can add various rude remarks to violent scenes, so much the better. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Not only does Collette give it everything she can to the point of nearly dragging this dead carcass to acceptable levels, but the talent of director Catherine Hardwicke also can’t help but surface in some moments."
fresh,"Lukewarm script, fun for mob movie fans with hilariously strong performances from Toni Collette, Sophia Nomvette and Monica Belluccii! This is my kind of mob flick"
rotten,"Despite its welcome feminist take, the movie only redresses, camouflages and cloaks what's still an obvious, on-the-nose, clumsy, and predictable premise. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Mafia Mamma personifies a vibrant voice and deceptively incisive ambitions in a crowd-pleaser bursting with creative gusto.
rotten,"A promising premise that wants us to believe in its wilting working mum who can kill like a professional, but it goes way too far"
fresh,"Moderately amusing. I didn't think it was all that funny, but Toni Collette is wonderful as always."
fresh,Super duper silly and fun.
rotten,Toni Collette can do no wrong acting wise but even she is not immune from selecting tasteless movies that are bad to the bone.
rotten,In the end Mafia Mamma falls between two stools; it’s much too violent to pass muster as a comedy (the MA15+ rating is well earned) and not interesting enough to work as a true mafia thriller.
rotten,"Still, when the female characters are often played as idiots, I wonder who this movie is for. If you check out Mafia Mamma, you will like Toni Collette and Monica Bellucci but not much else."
rotten,The movie dines on cliches and stereotypes without giving them enough comic punch to knock them onto fresh turf.
rotten,"This is truly what female empowerment is about, and yet the execution misses the mark. Viewers need to buy into Kristen as a woman whose kindness and willingness to step aside to serve others is the problem, not her poor decision-making."
rotten,Maybe if it had come out a few decades ago it would have been just another mafia comedy at least.  Now it’s not even that.
rotten,"... Mafia Mamma’s combo of fish-out-of-water comedy, swoony romance, over-the-top action, and violent mob film is merely far too much and never good enough."
rotten,"Mixing raunchy comedy with scenes of bloody violence, the movie tries to please a variety of viewers but may only leave them confused."
rotten,"Mafia Mamma instead comes across as a woefully misbegotten comedy seemingly sprung from the early 1990s, a film so beholden to tropes and cliches that it threatens to teeter into full-on parody at any given moment."
rotten,There’s an inherent shallowness that permeates nearly every frame of Mafia Mamma like a pungent salami.
rotten,Toni Collette's madcap mob comedy 'Mafia Mamma' is drowning in blood and bullets instead of laughs.
rotten,"Everything’s off in this godawful, witless mess...Catherine Hardwicke hadn’t directed a comedy before this film. On the evidence spewed up before us here, it could be powerfully argued that she still hasn’t."
rotten,"It moves tactlessly from scene to scene, adorned with outrageous shoot-outs and lousy jokes, producing a feverish cinematic experience."
fresh,"What the? Don't critics have mothers? This is a subversive gem, and proves that Toni Collette can knock comedy out of the park. The bottom line is festival of laughs, sublime supporting roles and yes RT fans, it’s an offer you cannot refuse! Toni rules!"
rotten,"Mafia Mamma is a chaotic farcical romp, carried by the charms, timing and gusto of Toni Collette’s comedic chops."
rotten,Mafia Mamma should be a fun vehicle for Collette and instead it’s just an offer you should definitely refuse. Boof.
fresh,A funny twist on the mob movie that keeps you laughing throughout.
fresh,"This high-concept romp demands an over-the-top and facile narrative, and some of the bits are a bit hackneyed, but “Mafia Mamma” is much more wacky, funny and violent than the too-tame trailers would have you believe."
rotten,"With this tremendous director and stars, the comedy could have been a feast rather than a predictable two-course meal -- if only there had been a meaty script to digest."
fresh,"Mafia Mamma isn’t going to win any awards, but I still had a lot of fun with it... even when some scenes went a little too far in the realm of the silly. I love that the film leans into the campy comedy and never takes itself too seriously."
rotten,"Despite some scattered laughs, this broad farce can’t sustain its thin premise while swinging at familiar comic targets."
rotten,Collette got to go to Europe and all we got was this lousy movie.
rotten,Collette is always an asset. But the film is riddled with cliches and unbelievable developments.
rotten,"A forced, flaccid farce."
rotten,"Listen, I don't blame Toni Collette for signing on to a movie that required her to travel to Italy, eat a lot of pasta, and make out with hot Italian men, no matter how terrible the script may have been."
rotten,It’s the 'girl bossification' of the mafia.
rotten,"The mostly suspense-free story haplessly bops along, tossing in some mostly thrill-free action and taking some mostly laugh-free swings at humor. Sadly nothing that it throws at the screen really sticks."
rotten,Who thought combining Under the Tuscan Sun with The Godfather was a good idea?
rotten,It's a front-to-back game of belief suspension that simply isn't funny or entertaining enough to not get bored when [its] obvious revelations take too long to come to fruition.
rotten,Hardwicke fails to rein in Collette’s performance. Her constant mugging for the camera reminded me of Jerry Lewis at his rubbery-faced worst.
rotten,This is one of those situations where a film was probably more fun to make than it is to watch.
rotten,In the running for one of the worst films of the year.
rotten,Leave the movie. Take the cannoli.
rotten,“Mafia Mamma” is a high concept elevator pitch that might have sustained a seven-minute comedy sketch but does not work as a feature-length movie.
rotten,"All these things are forgivable, though– the illogical premise, the by-the-numbers plotting, the workman-like photography, the wildly shifting tones– if the jokes are there, and the bottom line is that Mafia Mamma is simply not funny."
rotten,"A comedy without a single funny joke, Mafia Mamma will likely go down as one of the year’s worst theatrical releases."
rotten,"To say Mafia Mamma shoots blanks would be an insult to actual blanks, which at least go bang."
rotten,Mafia Mamma is hopelessly contrived and lazy.
rotten,"Despite an excellent performance from Toni Collette, Mafia Mamma leans a bit too hard into the zaniness. While this makes for a few good bits, Mafia Mamma falls into the company of other mediocre studio comedies."
fresh,"It’s stupid-silly and breezy fun, with a welcome feminist spin, and a committed, top-tier performance from Collette."
rotten,"[Toni Collette]’s maintained her flair for physical comedy and her double-takes are works of art but with this script, it’s not enough. The writers have let her down."
rotten,"It’s like someone’s always turning the knob in one direction, and then in another in Mafia Mamma, rarely settling on any mood with clear reception."
fresh,"In its own way, veteran director Catherine Hardwicke has turned all this into a more mainstream feminist comedy, a vehicle for Collette, who lifts it up a few notches and makes it all passable and likable enough for its 100-minute running time."
rotten,"Director Catherine Hardwicke awkwardly mixes some surprisingly intense violence with Kristin's Mr. Bean-like ability to emerge from any dangerous situation unscathed, but both the action and the slapstick are clumsily staged."
rotten,"Mafia Mamma may not be a great movie, but it has the vibe of a not-bad vacation."
rotten,"Unfortunately, the wit of Mamma Mafia is dimmer than the black of everyone’s chosen wardrobe."
rotten,The goriest death is by cliché. Nobody escapes it. Not even the wonderfully versatile Collette.
rotten,"There's something off about the staging, the timing, the setups, the payoffs, and the general performance of the comedy here."
rotten,“Mafia Mamma” is so wincingly awful it makes you question the professional bona fides of everyone who had a hand in greenlighting its existence.
fresh,"Funny and surprisingly violent mob comedy is a fun, but even watch. The more actioned packed moments are great, but even though the story knows what it wants to say, it does not seem to know how."
fresh,"Mafia Mamma shares themes with How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Eat, Pray, Love only with 100% more gunplay and slapstick violence."
rotten,Mafia Mamma is filled with lazy comedy and disorienting clashing tones causing one to question who the hell this movie is for
rotten,"Toni Collette is easily the best thing here, making an otherwise bland cliché of a character into someone you really do want to succeed as a mob boss."
rotten,"Mafia Mamma never finds its footing by swinging wildly through jumbled themes. You cheer for female empowerment, gag at the unexpectedly bloody carnage, and chuckle slightly at borderline offensive stereotypes."
rotten,"It’s escapism handed to the wrong helmer, with Hardwicke trying to combat fluffiness with edginess, making for an uneven endeavor."
rotten,"Both better than expected and not as clever as it ought to be, the sitcom level comedy Mafia Mamma is a throwback to a bygone era."
rotten,Mafia Mamma is an irritating mix of crude comedy and cloying drama failing on every single level. The filmmakers want to fool viewers into thinking that Toni Collette's shrill and mindless Kristin character is supposed to exemplify 'female empowerment.'
fresh,"“Mafia Mamma” is downright fun escapism that gives us a balanced story adding just the right touch of comedy, drama, action, craziness, and somehow blends gore and humor together as well."
rotten,"The game-for-anything Toni Collette inherits a mafia clan in Mafia Mamma, an uneven comedy where the jokes and the tone are as scattershot as some characters’ aim."
rotten,"When Mafia Mamma fails to elicit wit on the most basic level, the offsetting of its attempted comedy with shocking violence is even more of a variability."
fresh,"Collette is in her comedic prime flirting shamelessly and obliviously with a man who wants her dead, and it’s easy to enjoy when she is having so much fun herself."
rotten,"Director Catherine Hardwicke’s sense of visual style is there, but this one’s an offer you should refuse."
rotten,"Despite its best intentions at subverting the classic mob genre, the new comedy Mafia Mamma sadly misses the mark and delivers a story rich in tropes but lacking in substance."
rotten,Leaves both the gun and the cannoli on the table.
rotten,Catherine Hardwicke’s “Mafia Mamma” is an SNL sketch that’s somehow been stretched into feature length territory.
rotten,"It’s all played for laughs, which fail to materialize in a story that milks easy cliches and stereotypes about Italians, pasta and sexual double-entendres, with icky dialogue."
rotten,"So lacking in subtlety, cohesion and humor, it makes “Murder Mystery 2” seem like a Rian Johnson thriller."
fresh,"“Mafia Mamma” is a one-joke movie, but it finds ways to keep that one joke funny for 100 minutes."
rotten,"Mafia Mamma tries to be Under the Tuscan Sun, Goodfellas and a raunchy 2000s comedy yet fails at all three."
rotten,"Mafia Mamma has all of the right ingredients, but director Catherine Hardwicke treats the complicated science of movie-making like an improvisational linguine dish rather than a delicate tiramisu."
fresh,Toni Collette and Catherine Hardwicke’s silly romp packs some straight shooting heat.
fresh,The mob hasn’t been this hysterical since Analyze This.
rotten,Mafia Mamma simply imitates an empowerment fantasy and dumbs it way down.
rotten,Vapid... a limp noodle of a farce with a string of tepid running gags.
fresh,"Even when it gets too slight for its own good, Mafia Mamma keeps things moving along at a brisk, entertaining pace that pushes its flaws to the side."
rotten,"In isolation, there are some solid gags and throwaway jokes that connect. The trouble is that they are just increasingly few and far between."
fresh,'Mafia Mamma' is undoubtedly worth a watch because of the elevated performances of its cast and its endearing tale of a woman stepping into her power.
rotten,"Director Catherine Hardwicke’s over the top violence is poorly executed, but Kristen’s dispatching of Bruno gaining her more respect because of the ‘chunks of his scrotum found in his eye socket’ is one of the film’s only funny lines."
rotten,"""Mafia Mamma"" is completely silly and won't leave much of an impression on audiences, but sometimes a downright goofy comedy isn't bad when you need to get your mind off of everyday life."
rotten,"You don't often see performers the caliber of Toni Collette and Monica Bellucci in a big, broad, kinda dumb comedy, in this case about an American housewife who becomes a mob boss."
rotten,"This vapid comedy feels like it was crafted by a soccer mom groupthink that's desperate to be hip and edgy. Collette's overblown performance as a goofy, gullible American is a weak, stereotypical caricature of a real woman. This movie is terrible."
rotten,"Despite its intriguing premise about ageism and buying 'time,' Boris Kunz's dystopian thriller soon becomes formulaic and forgettable."
fresh,This is an entertaining and thoughtful dystopian sci-fi about aging and the vast chasm between the very rich and the very poor.
fresh,"This is a well-made, thought-provoking movie set in the near future. It’s the sort of science fiction that feels closer to science than fiction."
fresh,In its more serious moments warns us how revolting things can get when the people of science greedily sell their souls for capitalistic gain.
fresh,Paradise transcends the thriller and sci-fi genre to invite us to immerse ourselves in philosophical ethics and confront fundamental questions about human nature... [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"As far as Netflix originals go, Paradise is quite a gem. It’s got a great cast, a compelling story, and neat-looking CGI effects."
rotten,"As dystopias go, this one isn’t a complete bust. “Paradise” serves up food for thought in a just-provocative-enough satire of the growing gap between the coddled and well-cared-for rich and everybody they’re screwing over."
rotten,"Paradise starts with an intriguing concept that has the potential for unsettling darkness, but because some key areas are left unexplored, the story loses its impact, devolving into a predictable dystopian sci-fi."
rotten,"Although Kunz and a small pile of screenwriters work in a modicum of world-building, they mostly shun the implications of this society for action-thriller cliches."
rotten,Paradise is an average film with nothing new to say about the topics that it has chosen to talk about. The performances and the world-building are good enough to keep you engaged.
fresh,"The film threatens to become merely a high-octane shoot-em-up, but the mercurial plot keeps things on track with a succession of blind-siding twists."
rotten,"The sisters of this order opt for all white habits, a happy coincidence, I’m sure, which turns out to be the perfect palette for bright red smears, blotches, streaks, sprays and absolute pools of viscera."
fresh,"Without a doubt, the first half of the movie is the most achieved. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Consecration suffers from the lack of emotional scenes and an insufferable narrative structure that the movie builds up to a disappointing ending.
rotten,There has rarely been a genuinely great horror movie about nuns. Consecration is yet another in a long line of these misfires doing the usual stereotypes of uptight Catholic nuns in a substandard story about supernatural evil. The movie's ending is awful.
rotten,"The movie looks good, which is why it’s even more disappointing that the story is only held together by the flimsiest of movie tropes — the one where the central figure doesn’t know or suspect the truth that everyone around her clearly knows."
fresh,A muddled attempt with no saving grace to tell a story about demonic action at a convent.
fresh,"An enigmatic tale of finding one’s true identity and calling, Consecration’s fresh ideas are held together by yet another well-composed performance from Jena Malone."
fresh,"While Consecration leans heavily into the familiar cliches of holy horror, there’s some intriguing psychology at play; even if the film perhaps takes a little too long to reveal its most interesting aspects."
fresh,"There are a lot of horror clichés here, but it does go to a place that I thought was a bit different. So I give it credit for that."
fresh,"For those easily swayed by blood, nuns, and Jena Malone — i.e., those with good taste — there’s plenty of that to go around."
fresh,"Set in a Scottish convent, Smith makes the most of a spooky setting. A unique premise, but an uneven execution cuts the knees out from under the narrative leaving us with a religious ghost story that feels by turns both terrifying and silly."
rotten,"Consecration does not add to the tradition of scary nuns, as it lacks the conviction or imagination to consider the depths of unhinged piety."
rotten,"Unfortunately, the movie’s worst enemy is its structure."
rotten,"...an utterly worthless endeavor that feels much, much longer than its 91 minutes."
rotten,"Why, at age 84, she chose to make a glowering Mother Superior her first film role in a decade is anyone’s guess."
fresh,A religious folk horror thriller that does an admirable job of putting us in its protagonist’s shoes.
fresh,It’s good to see that Smith is still willing to risk biting off more than he can chew.
rotten,"It's bookended by a promising premise that both starts and ends in an interesting place. But it's the sluggish middle that may have enough going on to hold your attention, but that never takes the story...in any exciting directions."
rotten,A doomed Catholic themed psychological horror film.
rotten,"When the threat the characters are facing remains so vague for so long, it robs the story of tension. It doesn’t help that Smith keeps the horror elements to a minimum, or that the picture is so drably colored and dimly lit."
rotten,Through it all... “Consecration” grows increasingly murky and blood-drenched and contrived.
rotten,The writers toss out a dozen story threads and manage to get them so tangled up you might not know what the film is about.
rotten,"It handles too many threads—childhood tragedy, murder cover-ups, clandestine spiritual rites—without the dexterity to effectively weave them together."
fresh,"As bloodied and haunted as it gets, Consecration is a somewhat satisfying journey because Smith and Cook's script understands Grace is the anchor."
rotten,"Tension shines briefly, then snuffs out as quickly as a match in a storm. With a 90-minute runtime, Consecration still manages to feel tortuously long, like a weight crushing you."
rotten,"Director and co-writer Christopher Smith, who did “The Banishing,” has a distinct visual style that makes his not-quite-horrific-thrillers look better than they play."
fresh,"Sometimes you have to ignore the reviews and take a leap of faith because Christopher Smith's latest ""Consecration"" deserves more praise. Exceptionally well-made and boasting stellar performances, there should be plenty here to keep you invested."
fresh,"If Grace’s journey feels a bit obvious in the end—this is a movie where a character who can “see” things also happens to be an eye doctor—at least Malone, who does a convincing British accent, makes it a reasonably enthralling one."
fresh,"There are some neat ideas and atmospheric moments, though the story structure is a bit wobbly."
fresh,"Jena Malone brings a biting charm to her portrayal of Grace, but the story’s straightforward revelations end up feeling far too muted for the holy surroundings."
rotten,Atmospheric but lethargic and structurally misjudged...a lesser contribution to the ever-expanding genre of Catholic-themed horror movies.
fresh,"While Consecration isn’t near Smith’s best horror film, it’s an interesting little story that digs into the abusive secrecy and historical misogyny of the Roman Catholic Church."
rotten,"Smith is still a competent director, and Consecration can boast some moments of brilliance sprinkled all over it. However, the messy script drags Consecration down, and fans still expecting a new Triangle will have to wait a little longer."
fresh,"Smith weaves a tangled web of visions and premonitions that obscures the truth of the matter for much of the film’s runtime, creating a puzzle box narrative that’s as much a mystery thriller as horror-shocker."
fresh,"A consistently watchable, if inherently, predictable effort."
rotten,"A lot of this serves as an unconscionable reason for cycles of abuse to occur. 'Consecration' asks those questions, but forgets how to bring about a sufficient basis for its characters to keep looking for the answers."
rotten,Another retread of “spooky” Catholic-themed horror tropes without adding any insight or originality to the subgenre.
rotten,"... conjures some disturbing imagery while sprinkling some laughs amid the frights. However, the suspense dwindles as the incoherent final act turns into a bloody mess."
fresh,It's the age-old conundrum: are evil deeds truly sinful if they are performed in the name of God? Who's to say [Catholics] haven't been fooled by the Devil since the first words of the Bible were written down?
fresh,"Consecration won’t be for everyone and finds itself at the more reflective end of the Catholic horror film spectrum, but for those who like a slow burn this is a captivating watch."
rotten,“Consecration” commits the worst sin for a horror movie. It’s dull.
fresh,Maintains its creepy atmosphere even through its muddled plot.
fresh,"If you are in the mood for a horror movie with Catholic trappings, Consecration stands out from the dross that Hollywood deals in that vein."
rotten,"While it has interesting things to say about cycles of abuse and the overlap between the church and abusive parents, those ideas are lost in a haze of non-linear storytelling."
rotten,... one of those the-devil-in-the-details kinds of church-mystery films... too many mysteries unsolved at once that drags down an already meandering story... A clever plot device wasted on an atmospheric nunsploitation flick that tells instead of shows.
rotten,The scenery is gorgeous and there is an interesting time/space twist that’s a bit of good fun. But it’s not quite enough to salvage a tired idea told with pretty images and little enthusiasm.
rotten,Whatever grim atmosphere the filmmakers establish ... isn't nearly enough to distract us from how routine and vague the particulars of this plot are.
rotten,The plot... can’t quite find its momentum; it doesn’t help that most of the film’s scares fall flat on a visual and technical level.
fresh,"paranormal parable where everybody, on every side, is trying to do the right thing – with bloody, if perhaps not quite diabolical, consequences."
rotten,"For a film about evil nuns, Consecration weirdly lacks a sense of energy and horror."
rotten,"Doesn’t offer enough horror to really be taken seriously beyond its pretentious imagery, but most of all, it’s just plain boring until it gets to the bonkers last act where everything is explained… kind of?"
fresh,"“Consecration” is a film that twists about in your mind, its narrative constructed in such a way that it doubles back on itself throughout, revealing greater meaning when seen through its ever-shifting lens."
rotten,"The meager surprises it does contain aren’t particularly effective, considering that early clues suggest only one possible twist and the proceedings do little to mask it."
rotten,"The cast is committed and entertaining, but the narrative doesn’t fully take advantage of its more cleverly sinister (or dangerously angelic) ideas"
fresh,"Consecration can’t muster up effective scares and is prone to repetitive tactics. Still, its enigmatic story, bloody finish, and scathing critiques of the Church make for a fascinating journey all the same."
fresh,Fans of a slow-burn psychological horror will certainly find plenty to enjoy from the familiar territory and reliable jump scares.
rotten,"The gothic visuals and brief altercations between Huston and Malone keep “Consecration” afloat, but the filmmaker's assertions only adds up to another tedious and routine exercise that has minimal scares."
rotten,"Moves from a gorgeous shot to a confusing new plot point in the space of seconds. A disorienting watch that is impossible to get fully engaged with. Malone gives a spirited performance, but there is little else of note."
rotten,Consecration is a movie that seems like it's going to be riveting at the beginning. Then you get about halfway through and realize it's too muddled to be riveting.
rotten,"Atmospheric with solid performances, but clunky, overwrought, and neither scary nor suspenseful enough."
rotten,"Like so many recent horror movies, “Consecration” is more content with placing the audience in a dread-filled location for the duration of its runtime rather than simply scaring them."
rotten,Consecration ends up not just gimmicky but derivative of Christopher Smith’s own prior work.
fresh,Consecration merges Jena Malone with convent-based scares for a solid genre picture.
rotten,"Even with its average runtime, the movie feels overlong, as the story has far too many distracting, underdeveloped subplots when all it needed to do was explore the relationship at the center."
fresh,Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway have never been better.  [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,What pulls the film through is the impressive acting.
fresh,"The battle of wits and emotions remains fresh thanks to brazen, provocative, and cleverly insightful exchanges by the two very capable leads."
fresh,The recently deceased Jill Clayburgh and George Segal are a delight.
rotten,"The film does not support its talent, with its uneven tone and over the top comedy and melodrama."
rotten,"Part romantic comedy, part satire, part disease flick, this is a film that can't seem to decide what it wants to be, and ultimately fails despite two pretty likable leads."
fresh,"Even though it's a dog's breakfast... the chemistry between Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal, two of the most watchable movie stars on the planet, makes it a guilty treat."
fresh,"Its attempts to equally appeal to both male and female audiences come across as fragmented. Nevertheless, Hathaway deserves kudos for her sensitive portrayal amidst all the excessively gratuitous shots and crudeness."
rotten,"Love and Other Drugs is neither an aphrodisiac nor an expose. Its emotional reach is beyond its grasp, but if you're in the mood for seeing two likable, good-looking people come together, break apart, reunite and so forth, it will suffice."
rotten,"Hathaway creates a tough, angry, complicated woman who deserved better than her lot in life. For starters. she deserved a better movie."
fresh,"Love and Other Drugs isn't a perfect film, and Zwick has certainly done better, but for what it is, it's mostly watchable and fairly enjoyable."
fresh,This movie is far from your standard romantic comedy. It's a deeper film that touches on heavier emotional moments.
fresh,"Zwick and his writing partners, Marshall Herskovitz and Charles Randolph, overextend their scope by a wide margin."
fresh,"Lacks a certain something, but not chemistry between Jake and Anne. They set off real sparks."
fresh,"Charismatic turns from its two stars provide the heartbeat for the movie, which resembles director Edward Zwick's TV show thirtysomething with its insight into male/female intimacy."
rotten,"There were several potential avenues to develop here, but the film settles for something conventional and sentimental with its love story."
rotten,Can he love her when her illness degenerates? Can she let him in even though she's scared? Will he always work for the people who are actually making her life more difficult? You're allowed not to care.
rotten,"The movie has lots of scenes of the two leads in bed together, but it can't decide whether it's a big issue film, a romantic comedy or a weepy melodrama, so it ends up being none of them successfully."
rotten,"Strange how for a movie about a Viagra salesman, we don't see the growth of the characters."
fresh,"""Love & Other Drugs"" may have one foot in comedy and the other in the sickness-of-the-week genre, but that's the way life plays out sometimes."
rotten,"An overstated (dialogue-wise and visually-the movie's mostly close-ups) and underwhelming trip. And for a movie all about dickishness, its actual masking of Gyllenhaal's dick-twice with a cushion, as if out of a bad British sex farce-is limply dishonest."
fresh,"It isn't bashful at all, incorporating plenty of sex and humour; you'll feel like you're sleeping with them too."
fresh,"For it's hard work, sadly the film's two heartfelt, emotional scenes are wholly undermined by some awful soundtracking."
rotten,"I ended up wondering how a screenplay this messy had ever gone into production, let alone attracted two actors of this quality."
rotten,"A mess, but one of those messes where it's at least fun to debate the different ways in which it got it so wrong and could have been great."
fresh,"Interesting ideas lurk, tantalisingly, underneath the romcom formula and yet every brave move Zwick and his co-writers make is countered by something weak and formulaic, as if in apology."
rotten,"Eight months after health-care reform was signed into law, Universal Pictures courageously weighs in with a watered-down satire of the pharmaceutical industry."
rotten,At least we now know why Anne Hathaway's co-presenting this year's Oscars. She's not gonna make it to that stage any other way.
rotten,"A redeemed-lout-and-sacrificial-lamb weepie, complete with a shameless revival of the dreaded Ali MacGraw Disease"
rotten,"The two narrative strands don't quite mesh, and the movie stumbles badly when trying to effect the redemption of Randall through love."
rotten,"It's as if veteran director Edward Zwick signed on to tell one story and got railroaded into telling four different ones instead. The resulting film is a saccharine-fuelled, cliché-ridden mess."
rotten,[Its] restlessness and lack of conviction make it both fascinating and frustrating.
fresh,Beneath the gloss is the deeply unsatisfying feeling that Zwick isn't telling us enough about Parkinson's.
fresh,"It's certainly its own brand of cinematic viagra - guaranteed to arouse and, in the short run at least, perk up tired romcom audiences."
fresh,"Well above the standards of your average romantic comedy, it's funny, sexy and smart. It's just not smart enough to stick to its guns to the end."
fresh,"Ultimately, the unsettled tone undermines the romantic conclusion. Still, you've got to admire the ambition it shares with its cocky hero."
fresh,"By no means perfect, but Gyllenhaal and Hathaway are a match made in heaven."
fresh,"They gaze intently at each other a lot. Is that all it takes? Maybe. A useful date movie, then."
rotten,"Avoid this sickly-sweet, dishonest nonsense."
fresh,"It isn't quite Love Story, but comes close."
fresh,"This engaging film blends a true story with fiction, morphing from a rom-com into a moving drama as it goes along. In addition, it's a sharply well-aimed jab at the pharmaceutical world."
rotten,"Jake Gyllenhaal has all the sex appeal needed to pull of a romantic drama, but for some reason ""Love & Other Drugs"" was not the right script for me."
fresh,A pleasant surprise.
fresh,An enjoyable and ultimately moving drama that transcends its potentially mawkish subject matter thanks to a strong script and terrific performances from its two frequently naked leads.
fresh,"Sharp, softcore smutty, sweet and silly, Love & Other Drugs, like Viagra, provides an easy 'up' on a slow weekend."
rotten,Edward Zwick tries to become Cameron Crowe and delivers a dud of a rom-com with Love and Other Drugs.
fresh,Romantic dramedy uneasily mixes Viagra and Parkinson's
fresh,"But in Love & Other Drugs, [Zwick] and Herskovitz find a groove that delivers wry writing and smart cultural observation."
fresh,Love and Other Drugs is one of the better rom-coms to come along in 2010.
fresh,"The romance works, and the film's multifaceted, sprawling story produces dissonances which are often fascinating."
fresh,"In his first decent stab at comedy, Gyllenhaal's considerable brio helps sell the film, though Zwick's erratic direction make for an awkward, emotionally jumbled ride."
fresh,I wouldn't be surprised if Gyllenhaal and Hathaway are nominated for Academy Awards for their performances in this film.
fresh,"At last, here's a smart, grown-up romance that shows love just as raw and problematic as it can be in real life."
rotten,Avoid at all costs.
rotten,"If this film was a drug, you might ask for your money back, but you could just as easily find yourself riding high on the placebo effect."
rotten,"a big, sloppy movie that seems to be going in ten different directions by the time it is over. If we don't know how to respond, it is because the filmmakers never decided exactly what kind of film to make."
fresh,It's also a lot more intimate and a lot more frank and a lot more grown up than most Hollywood studio pictures are these days.
fresh,"And this was directed by Edward Zwick, who I always feel is a bit soft -- but I think this is actually quite a robust effort from him."
fresh,"Even if the film manages nothing more than a glancing blow at the pharmaceutical debate, it's good to see it being aired in a mainstream romantic comedy -- especially when it's as much fun as this one."
rotten,"Love & Other Drugs may well be a bodacious bonkfest, but you will likely find yourself looking elsewhere for any sense of post-coital engagement."
rotten,While the two leads have terrific chemistry; this is largely a predictable love story which skims over the more hard-hitting aspects.
fresh,"The likeable, charismatic leads give their best, even willing to flaunt their bits and pieces in an effort to provide the film a much needed edge."
fresh,"There's laughter and fun here, but also a melancholy note that extends throughout the film, which is what grounds it so firmly in a recognisable reality; and makes the film satisfying"
fresh,"Relationships, sex and vulnerability are the themes of this romantic drama that offers a compelling prescription for a complex journey, complete with side effects"
fresh,I was with her from the first moment she came upon the screen and without a doubt Hathaway proves she is one of the most gifted and talented actresses of her generation.
fresh,"Love and Other Drugs transforms the recognizable, mostly through its deeply written and beautifully acted principal characters."
rotten,"It's half eager romantic comedy, half earnest drama. And neither of them quite work."
fresh,A slick weepie made by smart guys who want you to know they're better than the schlockmeisters.
fresh,"A relationship drama that doesn't cut corners. It brings the pain, which makes the moments of triumph that much sweeter."
rotten,Mostly it's a Lifetime Disease of the Week movie with nudity.
rotten,"Edward Zwick successfully cloaks his critique of Big Pharma in the guise of a funny, sexy romantic comedy...until the third-act doldrums set in, that is."
rotten,What a spectacularly maudlin and repellent piece of work Love and Other Drugs is.
rotten,Once you have seen Gyllenhaal's butt and Hathaway's breasts you have basically seen all the movie has to offer.
fresh,"Takes advantage of likable leads with excellent chemistry, as well as an original and fascinating angle. It's one of the year's most satisfying movies."
fresh,"as many weak spots, but what it delivers at its core is as indelible as (and a lot more explicit than) the work of such legendary teams as Clark Gable and Joan Crawford, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn."
fresh,"Hollywood has repeated Drugs plot many, many, many, many times, this time around with a degenerative neurological disease duct taped to it for easy tragedy"
rotten,"Having worked as a Pfizer rep for the exact same period that our hero did, I can tell you that they got almost everything wrong."
rotten,"If distilled, there are enough stories here to make for at least one interesting movie. ""Love & Other Drugs"" just needs a dose of Ritalin to figure out what that movie is."
fresh,"There's the attempt with some R-rated wacky comedy and also tear inducing sadness. The film doesn't earn either, but the two leads and their lack of clothing make this a passable romantic comedy."
fresh,"The mental and emotional stimulation caused by the majority of the picture is strong enough to recommend it, but had Zwick trimmed the flaccid passages, he could have had an awards contender on his hands."
fresh,"Smart, sexy and funny, Gyllenhaal and Hathaway help make this the rare, entertaining love story."
rotten,"How many ways has Fox tried to sell ""Love and Other Drugs""? The first trailer I saw presented it as a ""Viagra comedy"" and didn't mention its heroine has Parkinson's."
fresh,"""Love and Other Drugs"" is a flawed movie. The script needed another pass to add more focus and perhaps zero in more on the challenges facing Jamie and Maggie."
rotten,Up in the Air. That's what Love and Other Drugs should be and isn't.
rotten,"Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal spend an inordinate amount of time rolling around in the buff, when not flirting, fighting or racing through overwritten dialogue intended to be ironic and cutting, but really about as sharp as a Q-Tip."
fresh,"Life is frustrating, exhilarating, confusing, astounding and unpredictable. So is Love and Other Drugs, a film with high aspirations and a slightly muddled follow-through"
fresh,An above average romantic comedy...
rotten,"Edward Zwick has rarely found a message-based project he can't muddy with weepy melodrama, and this is no exception."
rotten,"Hathaway goes all the way. She gives a marvelously instinctive performance that brings Maggie to life, even when the movie doesn't."
rotten,This movie is best treated like dim sum. Wait out the bad portions until a tastier dish is served. Let Hathaway be your guide.
rotten,"It can't make up its mind if it wants to be a romantic comedy, a satire about modern medicine and pharmaceuticals, or a melodrama about whether love will triumph over illness."
fresh,"""Love & Other Drugs"" is an interesting look at love in the nineties. And the added dimension of Parkinson's makes this a poignant study of the reality of relationships."
fresh,"Anne Hathaway is likely on the way to her second Oscar nomination --- Her co-star, Jake Gyllenhaal, is equally good."
fresh,"While the film zips along at a smart pace, balancing between humor and heart, it's the stunning work from the actors that turns what could have been a slightly-maudlin exercise into an arresting piece of work."
rotten,"In the second act, these lovers get scared of harsh reality and back off from one another. By the third, these filmmakers get scared of emotional honesty and retreat into rom-com routine."
fresh,"Touches on the dubious one-drug-fits-all notion of a chemical quick fix for emotional turmoil. But how richer this lovebird tale might have been, had it explored the clash of her economic struggle for life-sustaining meds, with his profiting from it."
fresh,"The performances are good but not outstanding, which also holds true for the flick. (Parental Review also Available)"
rotten,It works as far as it goes. It just never dares to go far enough.
rotten,"Love and Other Drugs is successful in small doses, but the full regimen needed more testing."
fresh,"The illness-related tragedy eventually tips the movie too far into melodrama, but for a while it's an effective antidote to the bloated seriousness of Zwick's past films."
rotten,"Contains the most upfront portrayal of sexuality in a Hollywood film in quite some time, and yet it's a complete turn-off."
rotten,Love and Other Drugs is a sort-of romantic comedy about erectile-dysfunction drugs and Parkinson's Disease. Because Lord knows you can't make a romantic comedy that's just about erectile dysfunction.
fresh,Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway put on such a display of star power and acting that they almost make us ignore the film's shortcomings.
fresh,"Given the pretty nudity and the hearts 'n' flowers finale, this one is strictly for teen fans of the actors to sneak into."
rotten,"Unfortunately the effects of the movie, therapeutic and intoxicating though they are, wear off before it is over."
fresh,"Altogether, not a bad trip."
rotten,Jake Gyllenhaal is great in Love & Other Drugs. So is Anne Hathaway. Too bad the movie's a mess.
rotten,"Too often the moral of this story seems to be ""Love means never having to say you."""
rotten,100 minutes of bitterness and raunch followed by a few minutes of honeyed niceness is a formula for self-negation.
rotten,One or two provocative bits emerge from the incoherence.
rotten,"If you want to watch these two struggle through an up-and-down screen relationship, rent Brokeback Mountain."
fresh,"Love and Other Drugs doesn't quite avoid the pitfalls of its genre, but at least the movie has the decency to make you laugh on its way to a foregone conclusion. Also, did I mention the sex?"
fresh,"Love becomes, for two people, the great challenge and the great educator, and at every step of this beautiful film, we believe it."
rotten,"While Hathaway and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry, and director Edward Zwick moves the narrative along nicely, the film is too self-satisfied to be genuinely touching."
fresh,A polished romantic dramedy that won't change your life but might make you a little happier for a couple of hours.
fresh,That Cradle Robbing Pervert Jake Gyllenhaal is naked so often in this movie I felt like I was Taylor Swift.
rotten,"The pieces of a good movie are in place in ""Love and Other Drugs,"" but they're in the wrong proportions."
fresh,"A throwback to an old-fashioned type of movie-making in which stars were stars, and it was the job of the director, screenwriter and crew to make them look as good as possible."
fresh,You will laugh. You will cry. You will fall in love. Zwick perfectly blended together raunchy humor with a hard-hitting emotional story.
rotten,A silly movie that takes itself too seriously.
fresh,"""The Age of Adaline"" greatly works as meet-in-the-middle compromise date movie that easily works for women and doesn't have enough really awful parts to scare away the men."
fresh,"Going from offbeat art-house to high-end mainstream with lush production values that would have been at home in the 50s, director Lee Toland Krieger approaches the material in much the same manner as Adaline lives her life."
fresh,"It's the performances of Lively and Burstyn, along with a compelling turn from Ford as the man who must confront his past while safeguarding his son's future, which are Age of Adaline's greatest strength"
fresh,"A silly movie that requires an almost impossible level of suspension of disbelief but somehow the metaphysical melodrama, with its lovely design and strong performances over comes the ridiculous plotlines to become an almost timeless romance."
rotten,The excessively science-fiction-steeped setup only undermines the parts that work.
fresh,The joy of Lively's performance is that she creates a sympathetic and appealing character out of Adaline.
rotten,"Gorgeous on a visual basis, but remains empty behind a heavily contrived plot, preposterous scientific mumbo jumbo, and unabashed romantic exaggeration."
rotten,One minute I'm baffled and the next minute I'm quite literally falling asleep.
rotten,This movie is so bizarre.
rotten,"It is a film with a good technical polishing that takes great care to be an elegant production, but has much less success in achieving a content that at least approaches the level of its form. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Ross's voice resonates in our heads with the same intensity as it did in Dominik's film, capturing the essence of the story with its kind, direct and serious tone. Unfortunately, the images say otherwise. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The unhurried storytelling matches Adaline's endless life, making this a respectable date movie."
fresh,"The audience is certainly offered plenty of beautiful bone structure featured in languid close-ups of the two leads, along with jewel-like, memorable moments of acting prowess from the older actors."
rotten,Takes its premise and squanders it on a run-of-the-mill romance that doesn't have the courage to tackle its themes head on.
rotten,"The plot is both ridiculous and overly convenient, stealing screentime from the deserving thorough period production design."
fresh,"The film's greatest gift might be that it harbors one of Ford's best performances in years. You can never tell these days how invested he'll be in any given project, but Krieger must have the magic touch."
fresh,I thought Lively was strong enough in the role and the chemistry between all was so good I enjoyed it.
fresh,"If you are looking for a romance film with hints of science fiction, this is it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's a lovely idea, but the film misses the mark."
fresh,"The Age of Adaline is a plushly packaged and has its fantasy charms, but it could have been infinitely more impactful."
rotten,"It's a film that takes itself way too seriously, even when there are campy elements that keep creeping into the material. It kept me interested to a point, before ultimately collapsing under the weight of its own silliness."
rotten,"For a movie about a woman who has lived for more than a hundred years, it's disappointing - and more than a little bit baffling - that Adaline is so lacking in dimension."
fresh,"It has the powerful tang of nostalgia, memory for things we knew or didn't know. It reminds us that time is precious and it's never too late to make a good life."
fresh,"Director Lee Toland Krieger has achieved a rich and warm palette, with fascinating inside looks at rarely seen historic San Francisco sites. Really, there is so much to love about this film."
rotten,There's really very little passion conveyed which makes the story lackluster. It's just completely flat.
fresh,It's a frustrating movie because it never really takes full advantage of its potential. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Functioning as a sly meta-comment on this town's love for preserving things, the smart romantic drama will make you think twice about ever again wishing for eternal youth."
rotten,... The Age of Adaline is incredibly boring.
rotten,"It's a clunky, luminous mess that ultimately suggests that a person who has lived to be more than 100, raised a daughter, traveled the world, learned a ridiculous number of languages, and had a lot of adorable pets hasn't lived until she finds a man."
fresh,...a better-than-average contemporary romantic drama.
fresh,"The Age of Adaline, a sentimental romance that's more watchable and touching than it may sound when you hear the premise."
fresh,"The Age of Adaline is the kind of adult romantic drama that's fallen out of favour, and it at least makes you consider how that is a shame."
fresh,"The Age of Adaline ends pretty much how you'd expect and takes a little long getting there, but will appeal to those who enjoy their romances delivered with a touch of history, and a little magical realism."
rotten,A San Francisco-set fantasy in which [Blake Lively] plays out a Benjamin Button-like existence through some truly awkward romantic situations.
fresh,The Age of Adaline is a bold and elegant film that treats its characters with respect and refrains from exploiting its very exploitable premise.
fresh,"Adaline turns out to be so earnest and genuinely sweet, that one should be able to forgive its schmaltzy excesses."
rotten,"Like Adaline, the film gives the sense of being somewhat uncomfortable in 2015, but while the movie makes a case for romanticizing the past, Adaline's story shows the limitations of detaching yourself from the present."
fresh,"It's a fascinating Benjamin Button-like premise and Lively shines in the lead, capturing the wisdom and weariness of someone over a century old. But it fails to explore what Adaline has done with her immortal life or the events of the 20th century."
fresh,"Lively is appealing, natural and often touching."
rotten,"The Age of Adaline is also slightly less a generic romance (though it is that, too) and more a consideration of time and desire, how each shapes the other."
fresh,"Much as you might try to dislike or even loathe it, there's an elaborate, honey-hued romanticism that sweeps you up in the goofiness of it all."
rotten,"Immortality can be depressing, but immortality when you have no discernible personality is truly terrifying. If the film were even the slightest bit aware of the macabre message it sends, it might be worth wasting a few mortal minutes on."
fresh,"Adaline is well served by its screenplay, which takes opportunities to wink at the audience without turning the film into slapstick."
fresh,"Lively's cool, timeless poise is perfect for Adaline's melancholy reserve, the aloofness of someone from a different era, wary of letting anyone get too close."
rotten,The Age of Adaline is salvaged by the performances of Lively and Ford; that is if you're brain hasn't been shutdown by fake science.
fresh,"Fans of more curious romantic dramas such as Benjamin Button and The Time Traveller's Wife will get the most out of The Age of Adaline, an engrossing if flawed drama."
fresh,"Staying 29 forever is every woman's fantasy. But, as ""Gossip Girl"" alum Blake Lively finds out in the predictable but endearing love story ""The Age of Adaline,"" that blessing becomes a burden."
rotten,A laughably absurd fantasy that goes nowhere fast.
rotten,It's a beautiful-looking movie with a ridiculous conceit.
fresh,"An unassuming yet sweet-natured little film that parents can actually enjoy with their children, and these days that's a rare joy to behold."
fresh,Unusual and engaging.
rotten,The movie dissolves into a flaccid shaggy-dog tale shambling toward its foregone conclusion.
rotten,An unstable combination of melodrama and fantasy that doesn't satisfy in any level. [full review in Spanish]
fresh,"The Age Of Adaline functions perfectly well as a harmless, fantasy-infused date movie. It's hard to really dislike."
fresh,"Lively does a good line in aloof, and if Huisman never convinces as the object of her desire then the narrative's peripheral relations more than fill the emotional gap."
fresh,"Free of violence, death or graphic sex, this romantic fantasy is an easy-going throwback to women's films of yore, complete with a smooth narration filling in the gaps."
rotten,"Ironically, this romantic drama about a woman who can't grow old creaks along like a centenarian with chronic arthritis."
fresh,There's a couple of hokey moments - the faux-documentary style voiceover explaining the science behind Adaline's condition - but this is never less than watchable.
fresh,"A quaintly disarming fairy tale, refusing any date that isn't written in the stars."
rotten,Beautifully shot and absurd.
fresh,"This magical-realist meditation on mortality is untroubled by logic, clarity, intelligence -- anything that might salvage such simple-minded slush."
rotten,"A lead performance of mind-bending dullness is given by Blake Lively, whose surname suddenly looks horribly ironic."
rotten,"Poor Adaline Bowman, sentenced to an eternity of looking like Blake Lively thanks to scientific hoo-hah that won't be discovered until 2035, Adaline never ages. Her movie gets old quickly."
fresh,"Like Benjamin Button, this drama plays around with the human lifespan, is slickly produced and feels far too serious for its own good..."
rotten,A pleasant and undemanding romantic drama that takes great care not to upset you unduly with strong emotion or embarrassing passion.
fresh,"Rather than just revel in the absurdity of it all, this film can be accused of being too stony-faced in parts."
fresh,"Harrison Ford's performance is the big surprise in this otherwise wonky, frequently shambling tall tale."
fresh,Surprisingly smart and moving and much worthier of a viewing than everything about it would naturally suggest.
fresh,"An unusual, thoughtful drama that takes a novel look at the fountain of youth, and that afterwards will have those seeking nothing more than a little light entertainment commenting, 'Well, that was quite nice, wasn't it?'"
fresh,"This pseudo-scientific contemplation of beating the process of aging is questionable from the start, but it's a bold and risky sci-fi in which logic isn't its primary source of dramatic gravity."
rotten,"A muddled mixed bag containing some fascinating ideas, a handful of terrific scenes and some good performances."
rotten,"By the time its two hours are finished, you might feel as though you've aged two years instead."
rotten,Blake Lively holds together a film that deserves to fall apart
rotten,"What a throwback pleasure director Lee Toland Krieger's latest would have been, if it weren't so exasperatingly unfocused."
fresh,"Age of Adaline surprises you with its warmth and sweeping romantic notions, despite its severely flawed logic."
fresh,"The Age of Adaline is a ""near miss,"" content to occasionally flirt with the sublime rather than step wholly into the uneasy."
fresh,"The type of bittersweet film that can trump the resistance of reason and logic, and sweep us into a story of longing, regret and renewal."
rotten,"The conceit endows Lively's regal air of distracted superiority with an intermittent pathos, but the director, Lee Toland Krieger, brings no identifiable perspective, and the screenwriters ... hardly tap a century's worth of material."
fresh,"An elegant, reflective piece of work that may not appeal to everybody - but if you're out on your first movie date, it may be just the thing to get you to first base."
rotten,"This is one of those movies that have you wondering: Long before the actors signed up and the locations were chosen and the sets were built and the filming began, how did someone not say, ""Um, we have a big problem with this story""?"
fresh,A nice change of pace before we're swamped by summer's big budget action flicks.
fresh,"A high level of suspension of disbelief -- we're talking Code Red -- is required to enjoy The Age of Adaline, and the film is charming enough and accomplished enough that we willingly give ourselves over ... to a point."
rotten,Fantastical - yet perhaps too reserved and tastefully restrained for its own good....
fresh,Harrison Ford himself shows up and doesn't disappoint; although the third act of the film lost it's way a tad.
rotten,"It does manage to pick up the pace in the third act and actually get us somewhat invested, but by that time we've already seen too much. It's certainly watchable, but best to wait until it's free to do so."
fresh,"There are plenty of problems with this film, however... The Age of Adaline still serves its purpose for a date night movie."
fresh,"The Age of Adaline is a ludicrous romantic fantasy, but solid craftsmanship and good acting make it an enjoyable one too."
rotten,This is a film that needs Amy Adams's twinkle or Sandra Bullock's nervous stammering. It needs a star with life.
rotten,"Everything is just a little off: The plot is resolved too tidily, and Lively appears ill at ease - she's stiff and self-consciously ladylike, as if she were a little embarrassed by the material."
fresh,"Like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and Somewhere In Time, The Age Of Adaline is a splendid new romantic drama with a beating heart all its own and terrific performances from Blake Lively and Harrison Ford."
fresh,"A movie that promises an escapist romantic fantasy on one hand, while delivering an affirmation that, even if our bodies grow old, passion can abide."
fresh,"Despite an almost self-destructive need to be taken seriously, this romantic drama still finds some swoony soul in its odd meditation on the solitude of eternal life."
rotten,Pretty silly. Harrison Ford almost makes it real. Blake Lively looks fabulous.
rotten,Blake Lively is lively in this original with nowhere to go love story. Not much else is.
rotten,"Romantic fantasy lacks magical spark, but OK for teens."
rotten,"The Age of Adaline is a modern romantic fairy tale set in San Francisco, marred by bad narration and an unnecessary desire to overexplain random magic."
fresh,"a strange film, hooked as it is on a character intent on revealing little. Lively, smartly costumed and coiffed in a modernized retro look, leans on a mannered way of speaking bolstered with a skittish fragility to embody her timeless character."
rotten,"For all its melodramatic mopey-ness, The Age of Adaline mostly treads water to its anti-climactic conclusion."
rotten,"Adaline is an 107-year-old mash-up of Hawking, Holmes and Mario Andretti, all dressed up in Gucci with nowhere to go. What a fascinating character the screenwriters never bothered to develop."
fresh,"The pic thankfully never goes over the side into full-out hokeyness or, worse yet, maudlin melodrama. (Full Content Review -- Sex, Profanity, Violence, etc. -- for Parents also available)"
rotten,"The Age of Adaline has a fundamental weakness: The tepid romance is supposed to structure everything else, so the film feels disjointed - a series of good, sometimes even great scenes in search of an organizing principle."
fresh,Harrison Ford rescues this movie like it was a stranded hiker.
fresh,I've never seen a less involving movie become so compelling at the exact moment when you've resigned to write it off as just okay. What happened?
rotten,"Oh the horror of spending your entire life looking like a sexy, twentysomething blonde Hollywood bombshell!"
rotten,Lively glides across the screen from scene to scene - like the ballroom of a grand old hotel with a suitor in hot pursuit - with all the emotional weight of a model in a perfume commercial.
rotten,[T]he movie's devotion to her current romantic predicament feels like such a wasted opportunity.
rotten,"For a movie about a 106-year-old - albeit one trapped in the body of a 29-year-old - ""The Age of Adaline"" doesn't have a lot of wisdom."
fresh,"[Ford] Baker turn a fairly tame two-way relationship movie into a more complex four-character piece. It's just as preposterous, but engagingly so."
rotten,"What eventually saves ""Adaline"" from being tossed on the cinema trash heap is the appearance of Harrison Ford about two-thirds of the way through."
rotten,[A] blandly manipulative romantic fantasy [that] represents the sort of melodramatic pseudo-profundity that poses as meaningful in hokey novels.
fresh,"Warmly crafted, with a satisfactory sense of mystery, ""The Age of Adaline"" resembles a Harlequin novel, but offers more spirit than simple forbidden love escapism."
fresh,"Lively gives a thoughtful, complex performance, with undertones of melancholy and a yearning for connection."
fresh,A sweeping romance beautifully wrapped in classy couture and slightly suspect in the way it uses metaphysics to manipulate matters of the heart.
fresh,"The film is as tender and endearing as a lamb, a lamb at rest in a fragrant atmosphere. It's a film that has a determined, unironic respect for things past."
fresh,"Via someone who's not Adaline, the film eventually addresses, with elegiacal eloquence, the nexus of never-was or the crossroads of coulda-been to which we can all achingly relate. Pity about the Nicholas Sparks playbook finale & damnable narration."
fresh,"With a steady head on its shoulders and a look as well-crafted as its lead's, The Age of Adaline is often hard to swallow but harder to dislike."
rotten,"Far too often here, Adaline's parade of period dresses, coats and handbags stand in for the richness of human experience."
rotten,a weeper that raises more concerns than true tears
fresh,"Leave it to Harrison Ford to pull off a rescue that one of his signature heroes might envy. In a deftly crafted supporting role, Ford does as much as Lively herself to shape Adaline's strange predicament into something genuinely resonant."
rotten,Michael Bay's film cannot help itself from taking brotherhood-fueled sides and blow everything up.
fresh,"Despite its flaws, I still found myself glued to the story..."
rotten,"Forget a logical progression of shots that form a scene, like words do a sentence; Bay has no time for such nonsense."
rotten,Could have been a fascinating and timely study of men juggling their jobs with complicated families lives but instead it is just another Michael Bay movie.
fresh,The film stayed with you and provided Bay with his best effort. A truly visceral experience.
rotten,The frustrating thing about 13 Hours is that you can feel Bay wanting to get serious.
rotten,"13 Hours is a typical Bay disaster, full of what would be called rookie mistakes had they been made by anyone else."
fresh,[The actors] take some of the most ridiculous dialogue and make it believable.
fresh,"Bay handles the action sequences well, but his sense of patriotism often trumps his sense of moral complexity -- something that is sorely missing amid all the explosions in 13 Hours."
fresh,"Yes, it's still patriotic explosions but Michael Bay has matured, Benghazi showing a more nuanced and balanced perspective from the bombastic director."
rotten,"Undeniably reverent of the real-life heroes who risked and lost their lives, but we are ultimately let down with a cliched script and overly Hollywood production that ignores the harrowing complexities of modern war."
fresh,"The film, while not without its share of real flaws, certainly offers something more than the usual big dumb [Michael] Bay business."
fresh,"With [Krasinski's] winsome presence as the central character, 13 Hours has far more pathos and charm than I anticipated from a Bay military spectacle."
fresh,"Bay allows this story to unfold, giving the audience the opportunity to understand the tragic circumstances of this horrendous attack."
fresh,The film highlights the contributions and sacrifices of the private armies of security people who work in the Middle East in exceptionally dangerous circumstances.
rotten,"Politics aside, 13 Hours is just a dull and poorly assembled grab for ticket sales. The film is visually hard to follow, never fully invests in its characters, and never gets the audience to do the same."
rotten,"13 Hours tells an exciting story in the most boring way possible, like a patronizing picture book describing warfare."
rotten,"""This is a true story,"" Bay announces at the beginning of this misbegotten misfire. You know, because more responsible wording like ""based on"" is strictly for wusses."
fresh,13 Hours gives honor where honor is due.
fresh,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi isn't required cinema for the action/war genre, but it satisfies as an adrenaline rush"
fresh,The film's biggest draw is the action scenes.
fresh,"There's plenty to cheer about and nothing really to reflect upon or celebrate. Save for the fact that, Bay had good intentions while making this movie based on real events."
rotten,"It's typical Bay stuff -- jingoistic, heavy on gunfire and explosions, but so short of proper characterisation that by the end I had no idea which of the gun-toting, super-macho contractors were alive and which were dead."
rotten,"... our typical loud, dumb, overlong Michael Bay celebration of guns, guys, and America."
rotten,"Bay chooses to pander, by promoting a worldview that has no room for intellect or compassion, and reinforcing stereotypes. 13 Hours is a film made with no thought to its larger consequences."
fresh,"Bay turns a divisive political issue into a film about machine guns, dirt, blood and gung-ho patriotism. Expect spectacle; insight, not so much."
rotten,"13 Hours remains very much a combat movie made by the man who once hustled Armageddon onto our screens, no more nourishing, affecting or heavyweight than the popcorn ground into the multiplex carpet."
rotten,Far too enervating to do much of anything other than be annoying. But you can see the good film inside of it.
rotten,There are few horrors of war that can't be reduced to blockbuster shtick.
rotten,"Fashioning big-brawn, tiny-brain, lone-wolf myths out of issues as complex as U.S. involvement in the Middle East is, at this point, morally irresponsible."
fresh,"Ultimately, is the takeaway. 13 Hours is a good Michael Bay movie... but it's still a Michael Bay movie."
rotten,"The emotional component is cheapened, at least partially, inserting a level of bad taste into the proceedings I found difficult to get past."
rotten,"The loss of life is movingly depicted but these largely unfeasible, weirdly unreal characters are much too cocky and swaggery, when not being disdainful and patronising towards the locals. So don't bother."
fresh,A moving tale of heroism and sacrifice wrapped in an explosive package that will quicken your pulse.
rotten,"At best it's a passable blood-pressure-cranking thriller, like a foreign-set Homeland episode, but without the political soul-searching. At worst, it's like a live-action Team America, roaring to climax in a noisy blaze of stars and stripes."
fresh,"""13 Hours"" ranks with ""Platoon"" as a true depiction of what war really is."
rotten,Makes American Sniper look positively pacifist by comparison.
rotten,"With the shootings and bombings going off incessantly for the movie's almost 21/2-hour run, it feels like the film-maker is gleefully navigating a military video game and all the film's characters are mere pawns."
fresh,"Will film professors laud it as an example of exquisite filmmaking? No. Will there be scuffed DVD's of it in Navy SEAL, Delta Force, and Marine lockers? Youbetchabygolly yes."
rotten,"Punishingly paced, flimsily constructed, and tackily executed, with the subtlety and panache of a third-rate 1930s melodrama."
rotten,"Michael Bay's retelling of the Battle of Benghazi lives up to its name, because when the last man falls to the ground, limbs gruesomely ripped apart, it feels like you've been watching it for half a day."
fresh,"It seems unlikely to join the director's ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon"" as part of the prestigious Criterion Collection, but it's upper echelon [Michael] Bay."
fresh,"The story of the attack ... in 2012 generally sticks to what is thought to have happened, and provides some tense action scenes without belittling the sensitive material."
rotten,"Given the focus is on battle sequences as opposed to character development, the 144 minute running time feels unnecessary. Fans of Michael Bay may think otherwise."
fresh,"For all his many crimes against good cinema, staging and choreographing elaborate and visceral firefights and skirmishes is what Bay does with aplomb."
fresh,13 Hours is director Michael Bay's most politically ambivalent yet.
rotten,"Between shootouts and explosions, this is a really empty film. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Good because director Michael Bay takes away the traditional glamour to war, bad becasue the argument is not allowed to be more critical of the US position in the world and its interventionism. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Michael Bay repeats himself, same cinematography and lighting, confusing editing, explosions and lots of noise. Very boring. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It suffers from bad character development, to the point where you don't know who is who and never feel a real conection with any of them. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It has it's flaws, but hte performances, the scenery and awesome action sequences make this a really enjoyable movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,13 Hours: The Secrets Soldiers of Benghazi may well become one of the best films of Michael Bay. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Michael bay missed a great opportunity to make an excellent film, but he let it slip away. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Only go see this one if you're a fan of Michael Bay's explosions. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Far from a reflexive exercise, it's a never ending shootout that serves to congratulate a political stance. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Bay simplifies the subject too much, leaving us with a good guys vs bad guys story that doesn't have any depth to it. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"13 hours is pure Michael Bay. Adrenalin, brotherhood, honesty, patriotism, family. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Michael Bay is back with a smaller budget in this homage to the military that isn't atractive, tragic, or interesting at all. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"13 Hours might be better than all of the Transformers films combined but that's not saying much, Bay is still comes out as a man of excess, xenophobe, patriotic and military apologist. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The material is there but Michael Bay loses focus and gets lost in this war story. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Ludicrously overlong and deeply objectionable.
fresh,"I hope next time we will get a better political thriller then 13 Hours pretends to be. But if you are looking for a simplistic action film with a touch of heartfelt dialogue, then 13 Hours is not a terrible choice."
rotten,"At nearly two and a half hours long, life is too short for how little Bay offers."
rotten,"A cinematic experience based on a true story; it relentlessly entertains, but it's ideologically questionable. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"If you are looking for an immersive action thriller, this will do the trick."
fresh,"Taking a break from his Transformer showreels, director Michael Bay mounts a frenetic, exciting, realistic recreation of the 2012 battle in Benghazi where a security team made up of ex-soldiers defended a besieged American diplomatic outpost."
rotten,"Bay certainly has a style of his own, albeit one that again harks back to the 1980s -- an even more cartoonish variant on the music-video bombast pioneered by directors such as Tony Scott."
fresh,The straight route taken through this true story of dual attacks on US diplomatic and intelligence interests in Libya -- and the controversial role played by hired military contractors in the aftermath -- is undoubtedly effective.
rotten,"Michael Bay may well have intended to make a film that simply celebrates the heroism of the US soldiers it depicts, and to an extent he has done that, but 13 Hours is a testing experience, bereft of depth or intelligence."
fresh,13 Hours is a pretty enjoyable film. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,The fact that Bay's only interest is in the sensory aspect of conflict wholly undermines the serious nature of the subject matter.
rotten,"Unsurprisingly, survivors of the incidents depicted have dismissed the film as utter nonsense. Even if this were not the case, the film-makers have some explaining to do to the military folks Bay presumably seeks to honour."
fresh,The challenge for Michael Bay was to make a compelling drama from a story whose ending is neither Hollywood-happy nor unknown. It is to his credit that he meets the challenge
rotten,"For better or worse, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is the purest distillation of Michael Bay's cinematic voice."
rotten,"This film is actively evil, but only by degrees."
rotten,...a thoroughly reprehensible piece of work that deserves every ounce of derision and vitriol thrown its way.
rotten,"The story doesn't work as popcorn entertainment or as serious docudrama, and 13 Hours often feels conflicted and confused (something we never thought we'd say about a Michael Bay film)."
fresh,"Tense and riveting, here's the movie some of us never knew Michael Bay had in him-the action, when it starts, is paradoxically both chaotic and clear."
rotten,"Not the subtlest director working in Hollywood, Michael Bay brings his surging machismo to this retelling of the notorious attack on an American compound in Libya on the anniversary of 9/11 in 2012."
fresh,"It's a fine story as far as it goes, but the ostensible bad guys are as two-dimensional as ducks at a shooting gallery, and even the good guys are strangely flat."
rotten,"The movie celebrates soldiers' survival, their ingenuity and heroism, their efforts to save one another and to do what's right in the world they know. But it stops short of challenging that world."
fresh,"What Bay and Hogan have done here is to sidestep the politics of naming names and, in honoring the heroics of six brave men, have subtly painted the politics of a changing global landscape."
rotten,"Michael Bay blows up stuff, unleashes massive firepower and concludes not much of anything in this jingoistic mess of a movie."
fresh,"Overall, 13 Hours does rather showcase the good, the bad and the ugly of Michael Bay. But it's better elements just about outweigh its worst, making this a much better movie than a lot of people would have predicted."
rotten,[Michael Bay's] here to remind you about the primacy of American life.
fresh,"A sombre military action film that steers clear, at least in Bay terms, of stoking up unwarranted patriotism or exploiting the scenario for cheap sentiment."
rotten,Harrowing scenes of carnage and death still fascinate Bay more than personal stories or political complexity so it makes for an exhausting watch that never lets up and rarely provides any contrast to the heat of battle.
rotten,I went into the film knowing almost nothing about the September 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya and came out knowing even less.
fresh,"Bay['s] view of the military is blatantly sentimental... Yet when it comes to the combat scenes, and to the nerve-shredding suspense sequences leading up to them, he is stunningly effective."
rotten,"Michael Bay propagandizes for a right-wing idea of 'true America,' seething with disdain for anyone who isn't a former elite soldier turned mercenary."
rotten,It all makes for a ferocious but flawed film - but I'd certainly buy the video game.
fresh,"Aside from mawkish family flashbacks, this wonky tribute to heroic courage works best when being visually dynamic and brutally immersive in its sensational combat sequences."
rotten,This film should be 6-7 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi. 8 Hours: The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi max.
fresh,A fictionalized version of events creates an entertaining action movie and a fitting tribute to those who died and survived.
rotten,"13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a movie for anyone who saw The Hurt Locker and thought, ""You know what would make this really good? If they got six really muscley dudes with machineguns to come in and blow away all the Arabs."""
fresh,"Bay gives plenty of punch, power and passion to what is a true story."
rotten,"It's undeniably spectacular in its own juddering, pyrotechnical, Armageddon-ish fashion, but it's also a film that leads a very rancid taste."
rotten,"With all that smoke swirling around our six heroes, all bearded, all muscle-bound, it's almost impossible to tell them apart. 'So which of them died?' was a typical comment as we left the cinema."
rotten,After sitting through this slickly violent clarion call for American political hawks to turn on the doves you might have thought that screenwriter Chuck Hogan was the right-wing spawn of Chuck Norris and Hulk Hogan.
rotten,The title should give you some idea of how long this two-and-a-half hour film really feels.
fresh,"Once you get past the suspicion that he's going to glance wearily into the camera at any moment, [Krasinski is] highly believable as the semi-reluctant combatant in a battle that looks impossible to win."
fresh,"Everything you'd expect from Bay is here with bells on - the macho provocation, the sound and fury, and the diabolical pleasure in reducing everything to rubble and bloody mush."
rotten,"Michael Bay dialling it back still leaves plenty of room for bombast, bombs and baloney."
rotten,It's all so hateful. Hates women. Hates talking. Hates tact. Loves guns.
rotten,"Plays like an extended Republican Party election broadcast, complete with relentless handheld camera carnage and beating jungle drum soundtrack."
rotten,"The film doesn't seem to take any risks either, presented in an all too generic manner."
fresh,"What ""13 Hours"" does brilliantly is recreate the absolute chaos and stifling options of urban warfare in the third world, the best film to do so since ""Black Hawk Down."""
fresh,"""13 Hours"" is not a political film, but will be treated as such by those with an agenda."
fresh,"This film is directed by Michael Bay ('The Rock') who specializes in action films, and this is definitely one of his better films."
rotten,"The kind of movie that would make Jim Halpert [say]: ""Seriously?"""
rotten,The attempts at pulling out for a larger view of the issues in play don't really work at all.
fresh,This is one of [Bay's] better films - mostly because the story is grounded in reality.
rotten,Patriotic and action-packed - just don't expect accuracy or clarity.
fresh,I actually liked this movie. God have mercy on my soul.
fresh,"The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully, that artist will possess at least half of Bay's punishing, peerless craft."
fresh,"...graphically captures all the dangers, gun fighting, bombs, and the uncertainty of the fight because it was all done in the dark of night by heroic independent contractors who have been ignored, even dissed, by the Democrats responsible."
fresh,"Exhilarating and intense on a visceral level. It's as powerful as The Hurt Locker, and the most mature, emotionally-charged blockbuster of Michael Bay's career."
fresh,I loved this movie not just as a American or as a military brat; it's a stunningly well-made portrayal of the horrors of war and a study of the bravery it takes to finish the job. I bet Transformers 5 still is atrocious.
fresh,"With a run time that is well over two hours and probably didn't have to be; you can clearly see that Bay is still in love with slow-motion and low sweeping shots. That being said, Bay has made a good film."
rotten,The first film Bay's directed that isn't a pointless and cynical bacchanalia of explosions. It will probably be the least financially successful effort of his career.
rotten,"There may never be an answer to all the unanswered questions in Black Crab, but one thing is for certain, the movie lacks certain elements of crucial storytelling."
fresh,"While the world-building leaves too much to the imagination and some of the characters lack much needed depth, “Black Grab” still manages to get its hooks in you."
fresh,"It is not exemplary of this genre that exploits dystopian habitats, but it mobilizes just enough facets to warrant a satisfactory result."
fresh,The action is often bloody but unfailingly tense and gripping.
fresh,"For ""Black Crab"" to succeed, Berg needs its central mission to be riveting and atmospheric  an original take on a familiar concept. For the most part, he does just that, with the films middle hour a dark and icy quest thats a welcome reprieve."
fresh,"This Swedish thriller is an example of an action film that would have benefitted from more story, and it could leave viewers as cold as its icy Nordic atmosphere."
rotten,The story is superficial.
fresh,"For those who could use a break from real explosions on the news, the fake ones in “Black Crab” are well-crafted, exciting and mostly harmless."
rotten,Black Crab is really two movies. The first -- the good one -- is an icy “lost patrol” adventure steeped in an end-of-the-world angst reminiscent of  Cormack McCarthy’s The Road. The other movie resembles the finale of any number of James Bond films.
rotten,"All shell, no meat."
fresh,"A persuasively apocalyptic vision that also embraces its inherent meathead absurdities, ""Black Crab"" is an Alistair MacLean and mean reimagining of the men-on-a-mission movie that is as much without relent as it is without remorse."
rotten,"It is not without its occasionally stunning use of visuals, but the plot points presented create too many questions, and it follows a fairly generic formula."
rotten,"An interesting, mostly bleak thriller that has plenty of good bits, even if they all just amount to yet another very forgettable direct-to-streaming release."
rotten,"Rapace makes the experience, comprising not much other than misery and suffering, worth tolerating."
rotten,"By stripping their world of any of this meaning, Berg and his collaborators show us only a beautiful, horrible emptiness. Frankly, it’s a bummer."
rotten,"While engaging, Black Crab's often beautiful and eye-catching visuals crumble under the weight of a predictable story."
rotten,"Hews to the traditions and tropes of the ""suicide mission"" combat genre and is only really surprising in how they botch the anticlimactic ending."
rotten,"Though its core concept is executed well, Black Crab’s dour tone, shallow writing and derivative plot-beats make for a movie experience that leaves you as cold as the ice its characters are forced to skate on."
fresh,Black Crab has all the ingredients to grab you and take you on a thrill ride -- and at times it achieves this -- but it suffers partial collapse by the end because of its need to land a little loftier than necessary.
fresh,Black Crab's chilly aesthetic and fun premise -- it's a mid-apocalyptic secret-mission movie on ice skates! -- enhance its somewhat predictable narrative.
fresh,"In supremely confident flashbacks that show & don't tell, Berg offers the right amount of story. If anything, Black Crab will leave one wanting more."
fresh,Black Crab is more than sufficiently gripping to make you want to see it through.
rotten,"There are no surprises in store, just a one-note thriller that never wavers in its commitment to a gloomy but extremely vague dystopia. It makes for a serviceable but forgettable experience."
fresh,"The spectacle ... of Black Crab is impressive. Beneath that, though, is a thoughtful and considered film about the moral fog of war."
fresh,"Black Crab offers an entertaining, taut thriller that utilizes its snow-covered setting quite well."
fresh,Noomi Rapace transforms from a desperate mother to a lethal soldier in a tense and visceral action-thriller. Black Crab is unflinching in its portrayal of war's savagery. Innocents are brutalized in a frozen conflict with no mercy.
rotten,"I'll say one thing for ""Black Crab"": I'm pretty sure this is the first and only post-apocalyptic movie where the characters spend the majority of the runtime ice skating."
rotten,Bergs film rarely inspires anything beyond a distanced recognition of his shallow pastiche.
fresh,"It makes for an intriguing adventure, as the serene scenery is punctuated by sudden encounters with thin ice, enemy soldiers and helicopter gunships, as well as suspicions there's a traitor in the group."
rotten,"A pacifist parable taking a brave stand against nothing, totally removed from the sociocultural landscape of today’s Sweden, it sounds out like one of Caroline’s screams into the howling Scandinavian wind – impassioned, futile, heard by no one."
fresh,"Berg can't bring the endeavor to an efficient close, but he has quite the introduction, finding many ways to avoid mockery as a potentially comical idea is transformed into a surprisingly tough war film."
rotten,"Ultimately “Focus” is a movie stymied by its amoral vanity, its overload of mediocre twists and turns, and the lukewarm chemistry between Smith and Robbie."
fresh,Could use a bit more focus in the storytelling-a late movie plot twist doesn't ring true given the lead up to the big reveal-but it zips along at such a pace and is enough fun that you may not notice.
fresh,"The entire picture is suffused with an ample dose of humor, keeping the constant double-crosses airily artful."
fresh,I was very impressed with this movie and I am glad that Will has got his groove back...
rotten,With a little more focus Focus could have been the blockbuster that Smith desperately needs it to be.
rotten,"Margot Robbie and Will Smith share a tangible chemistry, but their story doesn't go anywhere."
rotten,"With a lazy script, lazy central performances, and the look of a straight-to-DVD Nick Cage flick, Focus doesn't offer much to enjoy."
rotten,"Ficarra and Requa are trying to make The Sting or The Usual Suspects, but their story lacks the former's sense of fun and the latter's disciplined structure."
fresh,"Overall, Focus starts well, looks good with [Will] Smith and [Margot] Robbie as engaging as ever but it ultimately (and ironically) loses focus."
fresh,"Focus has the utmost intense scenes without guns or violence and a brilliant plot, full of wit and surprises to match."
fresh,You could do worse than sitting still for the solid entertainment and frothy brain twists in Focus.
rotten,"Lithe and funny until it's leaden and obtuse, Focus would be pleasantly forgettable were it not for Margot Robbie, who is announced here as a capital letter Movie Star."
rotten,"It's hard to move past the feeling that Focus is little more than wealth porn, wallowing in depictions of expensive cars, snazzy suits and the lifestyles of the rich and famous."
fresh,"Very occasionally Focus' Hollywood glamour is offset by an allusion to the idea that money can't buy happiness, but essentially this is a hustler romp with a surprisingly romantic slant."
fresh,"A fun bit of escapism that doesn't overstay its welcome, a tightly compacted little yarn from directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa."
fresh,"Despite their 22-year age difference, [Smith and Robbie] connect in that old Hollywood bantering way where a smile and a clever turn of phrase were enough to begin a romance."
fresh,"Focus is undeniably entertaining in most of its parts, but it's not as clever as it tries to be."
fresh,"A high-stakes gambling scam during the Super Bowl... is particularly nerve-wracking. This pace is exhilarating. But, unfortunately, isn't sustained throughout this otherwise perfectly fun and funny con-man flick."
fresh,"FOCUS is never too clever for its own good, while still managing to be an out of the ordinary film. Luckily, for Smith and Robbie, the duo have an undeniable charm that carries this duplicitous escapade."
fresh,"Robbie walks away with scene after scene in the movie, simply by being alive in the moment and alert to all possibilities."
fresh,"The movie makes a valiant effort, the twists are clever and surprising, but the palpable lack of heat between Smith and Robbie hurts the story. It's an OK con film."
fresh,"While directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa cleverly present their script as sleekly as possible, the plot is just too wandering to become any sort of instant classic."
rotten,"Misdirection and mis-direction are the central problems with Focus, which is an ironic title if ever there was one."
rotten,"""Focus"" doesn't find its namesake until too late in the game, making it a film to watch when it comes out on DVD or cable."
rotten,"The film moves smoothly, but it is segmented into two clearly delimited and uneven parts... [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,For the most part Focus is a slickly entertaining popcorn movie.
rotten,Too many convenient situations soon become distracting.
fresh,"In Focus, Will Smith's suave con artist Nicky Spurgeon tells his protégé/part-time lover Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie) his version of the done-to-death cliché: there are two types of people, hammers and nails."
fresh,"Focus is a bit too slick, but engaging nonetheless."
rotten,Nowhere near as clever as aims to be.
fresh,"The best thing about Focus, as with any successful caper flick, is that you are never quite certain when the con is on and when it's off."
fresh,"It's one of those movies where everything turns out to be a con so you never have to think about which thing is a con, meaning you can sit back and enjoy an OK-enough comedy about a May-December relationship built on a foundation of gambling and thievery."
rotten,"Smith and Robbie gamely try to get it on, but Jack Foley and Karen Cisco they are not."
fresh,"It reminds us why he became a star in the first place, and provides a glimpse of where he might go from here."
fresh,"Regardless of its gleaming production and costume design, smooth technical style and frisky musical score, Focus is largely seductive because Smith and Robbie are the seducers."
rotten,"While Focus is probably instructive for those wanting to know how to create a diversion and steal a wallet, it lacks the tension and jeopardy required to give this film the momentum it needs to be more than just forgettable fun."
rotten,Vacuum-packed free of charm and charisma.
rotten,Ficarra and Requa understand the genre and know what makes it effective-they just can't quite execute correctly.
rotten,Focus takes some pride in its tidy arrangement of con-man movie clichés.
rotten,"If it's so easy to guess what women want, why is this movie so utterly devoid of any of it?"
fresh,"A slick and entertaining cocktail of crime and romance in which Smith plays a, wait for it, bad guy. Sort of."
fresh,Entertaining and surprisingly unpredictable.
rotten,"The first half of the film... is somewhat entertaining, and some of the comedic dialogue in that section also periodically hits. It is the second half of the film, set three years later in Buenos Aires, where things fall very flat."
fresh,"Focus stars Will Smith as a master con artist who lets a small-time scammer into his crew, and into his heart. Or... wait, does he?"
fresh,"Focus has so many elements that I enjoy in a movie, but I wish its casting hadn't made me spend so much time pondering who should have played the male lead in this picture."
rotten,"If the movie nonetheless leaves us feeling unsatisfied, that's because the characters, reduced to flies in the writers' tangled web, never quite give us a reason to care."
rotten,Focus was made by the writing/directing team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa... The twisted charm [their] earlier titles generated is utterly missing this time around.
fresh,"If it feels like the prequel to a smoother, pacier heist film, at least this is sufficiently charming that we might see a follow-up one day."
rotten,Can't con us into believing
rotten,"After a solid decade of dreck, the seductive con man rom-com Focus allows star Will Smith to slip into a little suave adult sophistication, while rehabbing his image by playing the familiar part of the brash, smooth-talking charmer."
fresh,It is chiefly the chemistry between the lead pair that makes this movie quite enjoyable.
fresh,"No new ground is covered, no unknown secrets revealed, but instead you get a mildly entertaining trip into the world of professional crime by some attractive, terrible people."
fresh,"A good con-job movie, unlike a real-life con-job, finds a way to make you enjoy getting taken for a ride. Focus offers some of that giddy pleasure but it can also be, like its lead character, a bit too smooth and slick and sure of itself."
fresh,It's a caper movie you can keep up with if you just 'Focus.'
fresh,"It's nice to see Will Smith having fun in a role again, and Margot Robbie makes for a good partner in crime."
fresh,"Focus is fun, slick, engaging and sexy. Also Margot Robbie."
fresh,"The leads are appealing together, and that turns out to be the most crucial element of the movie."
rotten,"The hole in the story is Smith, who holds onto his detached Will Smith screen persona too closely to make his portrayal on a con man convincing."
rotten,"Focus would like nothing more than to evoke the easy style and playful personality of the Oceans movies, but surface glamour is no substitute for character."
rotten,You don't want to be any of these b*******.
rotten,"It's ironic that a movie titled ""Focus"" never truly provides a focal point for its audience."
fresh,For the start of 2015 this is a strong film that audiences will enjoy!
rotten,"If I wanted to see a thief not have a good time, I'd just find footage of Robin Thicke hearing the ""Blurred Lines"" plagiarism verdict."
fresh,"Focus is a movie with an arbitrary title, but full commitment from its cast."
fresh,"The film bogs down, certainly, and it bogs down in some very damaging places. But it soars just enough to be, on balance, an enjoyable bit of fluff."
fresh,"Surprisingly enjoyable in spite of its flaws, Focus almost 'cons' you into having a good time."
rotten,"Fails to ensnare its audience thanks to fatiguingly frequent ""ah, bet you didn't see that coming"" narrative twists."
fresh,Focus is great fun (if morally bankrupt).
rotten,"Focus is not a picture that reflects reality, and requires a true suspension of disbelief to fully get along with. However even then, it's still something of a struggle."
fresh,"Will gets into pulling off the somehow simultaneous unusual challenge of getting into the trickster head of his artful dodger character Nicky manipulating the world around him, and impressing the audience with believable master con moves as well."
fresh,"Enjoyable, disposable, twist-laden fun, the film does suffer from that weird, ironic movie syndrome wherein it works so hard to be unpredictable that it adopts a predictable pattern."
fresh,"In Focus, [Smith is] quieter, graver, more emotionally remote, more... substantial."
rotten,One twist and turn too many. Robbie shines while Smith doesn't.
fresh,"It has so much eye-candy razzle-dazzle, and it looks so fabulous, you forget its flaws and get lost in its cool, groovy vibes and its long-con gamesmanship, and-hey, where's my wallet?!!"
rotten,"Focus has some hard swallows, including a last-reel speech so inessential it's comical, but it's also got a unique syncopation about it that's admirable, if not entirely effective."
fresh,[Writer-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa] set exactly the right tone as well as tweaking the plot with enough twists to keep your brain engaged. And it looks good too.
fresh,"There are a few problems with the film, not least the ending (no spoilers), but it has the pizazz and all the elements that you would expect from a film like this."
rotten,"Focus, while being generally entertaining, is a largely familiar and overly glossy run through cinematic con artist conventions"
rotten,"Never boring but not all that engaging, ""Focus"" proves that Will Smith still has all the charisma he ever did. Unfortunately, that's not enough to distract us from a mediocre flick."
rotten,"Once the real game begins, the humor starts to miss and the plot points get ridiculously unbelievable. While Smith shows flashes of his classic charisma, Robbie is under-used and no one else is around to step up and make us care."
fresh,"Focus is fun, slick, engaging and sexy. Also Margot Robbie."
fresh,Focus is about the sensation of having your wallet lifted by a pickpocket with nimble fingers. And it's skilled enough to earn the viewer's emptier billfold.
rotten,The biggest con is its lack of cons.
rotten,"That sound you hear is the high-fives in the writers' room, and that, unfortunately, is where the filmmakers' focus remains."
rotten,Can they trust each other? Of course not. Do we care? Not really.
fresh,"It's slick and fast and crammed with cons both big and small, but it's the irresistible dynamic between Will Smith and Margot Robbie that makes this smoke and mirrors flick so enjoyable"
fresh,"This is a fun movie with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. There are some nice set-ups and the story is clever in places, but not quite clever enough. The acting is solid, the pace is fast and the production values are good."
rotten,"Based on 2013's Now You See Me and this picture, it's obvious that Hollywood's hustlers have lost their sting since the days of Paul Newman."
fresh,The first half of 'Focus' is close to flawless as it slickly delivers laughs and tense set pieces that more than pay off.
rotten,"When a character refers early on to a manoeuvre called the 'Toledo panic button', anyone familiar with Chekhov's loaded rifle just knows it's going to be pushed before the movie's end."
rotten,"By the end, it feels as though moviegoers are the ones who need to check their pockets."
rotten,"Had this been a stepping-stone project for Smith in the mid-90s, it would have been perfectly fine. However, I expected more from Will Smith."
rotten,...it's finally impossible not to wonder if the film might've fared better had it not contained such a ludicrous romantic pairing.
fresh,"Though it may not go the way you expect it to, Focus makes up for that small disappointment ... with a denouement that's refreshingly uncynical."
rotten,A load of con-artist movie hooey with two spectacular looking leads.
fresh,"Focus is a movie about con artists that itself is a complete con. It swivels logic and loyalties when necessary, borrows from better cinema scams like The Sting, and plays everyone for suckers. Focus is also a decent amount of fun."
fresh,"A smart, often wickedly funny look at two people trying to be true to themselves while being utterly false to everyone else."
fresh,"Despite its 'never lose focus' catchphrase, unnecessary tangents and underwhelming reveals make Focus a somewhat unfocused, though still enjoyable, viewing experience."
fresh,"[For Smith,] Focus isn't a full return to brilliance but a welcome stop, hopefully, on the way there."
fresh,"With Smith back in his element plus the timeless appeal of a well-executed con story, Focus is undeniably fun."
rotten,Robbie brings such genuine feeling to heavier scenes and such joy to light ones that her acting fools us into thinking Jess is a more developed character than she is.
fresh,"Ficarra and Requa direct some fascinating sequences, including a long, brisk montage of illegal acts that shows us how Nicky's team operates."
rotten,"Making matters somehow worse, co-directors Ficarra and Requa give the proceedings the high gloss of a luxury-car commercial in an effort to offset the film's toxic levels of avarice with some visual glamour."
fresh,"It's a shiny, diverting ride. (And right about now, that's OK.)"
fresh,"Perhaps the film's greatest trick is the one that happens offscreen: Hours after the end credits roll, it will completely disappear from your mind."
rotten,"While Focus is fun, with intrigue, twists, and turns that will likely only hold up to one viewing, the romance ends up being the focus. Unfortunately, loyalty between liars doesn't equal a love story."
rotten,"This is the kind of movie where we're not supposed to know at any time who is playing whom, but since the characterizations are glossy and paper-thin, it's difficult to get worked up about who gets fleeced."
rotten,"Engages in so much rug-pulling, eventually, we just stop standing on the rug."
fresh,"""Focus"" has a flippant air to it, as if defying you to take it seriously."
fresh,Light-hearted and fleet-footed.
fresh,"If we're to look at Focus for the qualities of its con, it'll earn your wallet, and you'll be totally okay with that."
rotten,"Mildly entertaining, but mostly preposterous."
rotten,...not a scintilla of chemistry between Smith and Robbie...nauseatingly awful love scenes...preposterous situations...dialogue neither clever nor funny...deficient acting (but what could anybody do with this script?)...an ending that is worse than absurd.
fresh,Charming but uneven heist film is too sexy for young teens.
fresh,"Two movies for the price of one. You get a sparkling, sexy comedy and its lackluster, dispiriting sequel, both in the same sitting."
rotten,Focus isn't one con too many. It's about a half dozen more than any story can handle.
rotten,"It's tough to take anything ""Focus"" offers seriously when it feels as though Nicky and Jess could pull out lightsabers at any moment."
rotten,"Lots of hocus pocus but not much focus in Focus. Or, dare we say Focus is often out of focus? Either works. The movie does not."
fresh,"Slick, subversive and distracted, this crime caper is a mildly entertaining diversion."
fresh,"As they did in I Love You Phillip Morris and Crazy, Stupid, Love, Ficarra and Requa prove to be masters of misdirection in this fluffy but fun romp."
fresh,Love Again is a charming rom-com with meaningful dramatic moments and likable enjoyable characters worth rooting for another chance at true love.
fresh,Is the film successful in converting the stone-hearted into a believer? Not completely. But it does get sufficiently close.
rotten,"For what it is, a sort of wistful, sad Hallmark romance with pretty leads who have little chemistry, it’s not terrible. Random laughs are scattered throughout."
rotten,... To watch this movie is to experience molecular-level embarrassment for all involved parties.
rotten,[An] often maudlin tale that’s an unconvincing combination of P.S. I Love You and Sleepless in Seattle.
fresh,A sweet romance that throws up two surprises - first of all Celine Dion can act and second of all the film takes on a more serious tone than you would expect at times.
rotten,"Love Again is not even on the cusp of being a memorable romantic-comedy, especially because it apparently forgot that a prerequisite of the genre is to provide laughs."
rotten,Has a certain amount of charm but the needed chemistry between Jonas and Heughen just isn't there.
rotten,"Love Again starts out with an uncomfortable premise, and things get worse from there. Even those who ironically enjoy Hallmark TV romances might have difficulty with a movie that can’t seem to hit the right notes."
fresh,"Fluffy, cheesy and nary a sense of ingenuity, Love Again can be seen as a throwback to the plentiful rom-coms of yore. Or as a laughable pastiche with sugar levels so high, it will make your teeth rot. Let the power ballad of the Queen guide you."
rotten,Even the lead pair’s chemistry is up for debate. Love Again’s rehashed plot can’t help falling prey to all the rom-com tropes by being sappy and entirely predictable with not enough comedy.
rotten,"It’s got a Hallmark-level plot, and in other hands, perhaps the movie could be a little charming."
rotten,"If you want to see something familiar and comfortable and entertaining, ""Love Again"" is a decent option; just don't go to see it expecting something new or different. There would be no use. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,It still overall charmed me and I thought everything with Celine Dion was cute. I love the idea of people falling in love over their words.
rotten,"Give me Priyanka Chopra Jonas clobbering away in a cheeseball action series over moping around in a silly, schmaltzy, romance that's long past its shelf life."
rotten,"It is of course Dion’s overwhelming voice and music that flood your heart, not this flimsy and occasionally morbid story."
rotten,"... A romantic comedy where everything you think it's gonna happen, happens. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Sadly, I’m not sure her [Celine Dion's] five new ballads power over this rom-com’s sizable plot holes."
rotten,"Love Again sounds like a title where novelty goes to die, and the resulting film certainly does nothing to deviate from such lowered expectations."
rotten,"Despite the wacky commitment of Dion, Love Again is not a product you’re likely to fall for; you’re not even likely to settle either, as it’s all too sadly bland that you’d be better off adopting a mantra of the singer herself and stay “All By Myself”."
fresh,... A journey towards the light not only from the darkness (the death of the loved one) but in its company to try to understand and overcome it. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Playing herself, the singer [Celine Dion] lends freshness and novelty to a plot that's loaded with all the Rom-Com toolbox clichés, yet still manages to come out from it better than other movies of its sort. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"However unintentionally, some romantic comedies can prove to be quite divisive, pleasing some with their twee, featherweight tales of love while making others wish for global thermonuclear destruction. Love Again is such a film."
fresh,"But in a world in which movies like Mamma Mia!, Yesterday, and Blinded by the Light have already explored ways of making a movie inspired by a single artist/group's music, a romance that co-stars Dion as a sort of guardian angel makes its own sense."
rotten,This putative romantic comedy is so bland that it’s already dribbling away from my memory.
rotten,"It’s not much to examine at length, much less remember, but if you’re in the mood for a Hallmark card to revive your faith in gooey rom-coms, Love Again is not the one."
fresh,"While the film doesn’t offer the non-stop campfest some people might feel they have been promised, it does have enough self-consciously ridiculous moments to stay entertaining even when it looks somewhat cheap and slapdash."
fresh,"The presence of Celine Dion, who provides the soundtrack with new songs besides her presence, helps to make this too syrupy flick at least a reason to watch."
rotten,"You can probably guess the next series of developments, and let’s just say those guesses wouldn’t be far off. Love Again plays out like some ungainly melding of You’ve Got Mail and the Gwyneth Paltrow-Ben Affleck plane crash movie Bounce..."
rotten,"Most of the laugh lines in Love Again are stale enough that even just hearing them kind of hurts your teeth, but for all of its blatant ridiculousness, this movie seldom tries to be funny."
rotten,"Your heart will go on, and your eyes will look away in embarrassment."
rotten,"It’s not that Love Again has a script so marvelous that ChatGPT could never replicate it. In fact, we’re looking at the exact opposite situation... Love Again is a rom-com so uncharming that the film’s dreadfulness can only be attributed to human error."
rotten,"Perhaps a rare instance where an entire movie has been crafted around an extended cameo, Dion's presence at least enhances the soundtrack, if not the woefully predictable plot."
rotten,"Unfortunately, only Dion can deliver this combination of cheese, camp, unabashed earnestness and exaggerated sentimentality. On everyone else, it feels effortful and a little cringe..."
rotten,A series of awkward gestures meant to comprise a movie.
rotten,The film is nothing but a chintzy promotional tool for Celine Dion.
rotten,"I’ve seen Hallmark movies where the romantic leads have better chemistry, where the screenwriters have crafted better banter (and more skillfully summoned the ghost of The Shop Around the Corner), and where the fake snow looks more realistic."
rotten,"A lazy, misguided, and uninspired romance, Love Again proves that streaming services and Hallmark haven’t entirely cornered the market on poorly made, low aiming lovey-dovey content just yet."
rotten,This is a shockingly oblivious and embarrassing movie.
rotten,"There’s not much chemistry between Chopra Jonas and Heughan — and how could there be, since they’re stuck in a one-way conversation for half the movie? Plus, Mira’s texts are just so sad."
rotten,"Strouse goes to wildly contrived lengths to deliver this power ballad of a love story, and it’s one that maybe only Celine Dion fans will be able to hear."
fresh,"Heartwarming, tender and witty. If you enjoy 90's romcoms like You've Got Mail and While You Were Sleeping, you'll probably enjoy Love Again, too."
rotten,"There’s not a believable moment in “Love Again,” so it’s for hardcore rom-com fans only."
fresh,"Carries initial care for profound situations of pain, finding ways to address the reality of the mourning process without completely losing itself to cliché."
rotten,"The painfully unfunny, boring, and very outdated Love Again is a fake-looking romantic comedy/drama that also wants to be a Céline Dion commercial. The romance looks forced and unnatural. Everything is an embarrassment for everyone who made this junk."
fresh,"After a slow and choppy start, the action picks up to a brisk pace and is unrelenting straight through to the final — somewhat sappy — montage."
rotten,I have always admired the sense of urgency and danger this franchise was able to bring to the table. Unfortunately this uninspired sequel has overstayed its welcome due to its overdrawn runtime.
rotten,"This latest offering in the franchise is a painful failure. Gone is all of the magic of the original movie having been replaced by a convoluted story, tired characters and a technology that now seems archaic."
rotten,"Written by Trevorrow and Emily Carmichael, Jurassic World's narrative is an oddball situation, and almost feels as if two films have been haphazardly mashed together."
rotten,"the definition of an Amusement Park. Fun, silly,crowded,nasty,& exhausting… but in the end you look back & go that was kinda fun! Mixing the old & new cast had some great moments but I love how practical a lot of dinosaurs were,overall it’s not that bad"
rotten,"Jurassic World: Dominion is impressive in its ability to flush away all the good will of the films that came before it. By the 90-minute mark, the audience is almost rooting for the locusts to win."
rotten,"A massive disappointment on virtually every level. The cast, visuals, and score might save this from being a complete trainwreck, but not from miserably failing to deliver an epic conclusion to a saga that deserved nothing less than that."
rotten,"According to studies, land-based animal extinctions occur every 27 million years, give or take. In the case of the Jurassic franchise, they occur every sequel."
rotten,"Might be a disappointment, but it's still an improvement over Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdo/m."
rotten,The final chapter of the Jurassic World trilogy looks to bring closure to the series but winds up repeating itself in odd and disappointing fashion.
fresh,"This is 2nd best out of the Jurassic World trilogy. It's very brutal at times, it feels like the characters are lot more likable & even the action feels much more thrilling. My issue is that this doesn't feel like a apocalyptic scenario that it should be"
rotten,Most of the sins of Jurassic World Dominion would be forgivable if the movie were more fun.
rotten,Jurassic World: Dominion is the worst thing to happen to the dinosaurs since that meteor 65 million years ago. This is how a franchise dies. With raptor-less applause.
rotten,"A disappointing end to something that could've been great, and hopefully the last we'll see of the franchise for a while - until they can come up with something really new."
fresh,"Jurassic World Dominion succeeds because of the nostalgia of seeing Dr. Settler, Dr. Grant, and Dr. Malcolm working together again, but ultimately their storyline does nothing to improve upon the ideas presented in Jurassic World."
rotten,"At one point Dr. Sattler, viewing the majesty of the replicated dinosaurs, says, ""You never get used to it."" Except here's the problem: you actually do. Familiarity with CGI monsters breeds, well, not exactly contempt. Mostly just boredom."
rotten,"If you didn't know better, you'd think Chris Pratt had never acted before."
rotten,Viewers seeking a watchable combination of marauding visual effects and human actors running for their lives can find fun in this. It is only if anybody is seeking something more than that will the problems start.
rotten,"Colin Trevorrow cannot access a single iota of magic of the Steven Spielberg classic that started it all — without resorting to cheap nostalgia. He still tries though, but it's the equivalent of a T-rex chasing its own tail with its tiny-ass arms."
rotten,"Jurassic World Dominion might be the new best-of-a-bum-bunch-of-sequels, but that's hardly a cause for celebration."
rotten,We could just “leave our brains at the door.” But I can’t imagine that’s what made people fall in love with this franchise in the first place.
rotten,"It has an intriguing crisis at its core, but ultimately succumbs to the same problems its predecessors did in that the screenplay is extremely weak, once more padding the film out to an absurd runtime with monotonous action sequences."
rotten,"""Dominion"" never really lives up to its promise."
rotten,The latest film seems to have forgotten one of the delights of dinosaur nerdery: imagining the world without humans.
rotten,"This unnecessary sequel is unbearable, unwatchable, and too incoherent to suffer through"
rotten,"While there's plenty of spectacle to go around, the focus on corporate espionage and locusts wastes the premises potential."
fresh,Some terrific set pieces and the return of characters we’ve grown to know and love helps a lot even if it keeps anyone from really doing something with the concept. But by this point what else is anyone expecting from a Jurassic Park sequel?
fresh,"You could fracture its logic with a single eyelash, when it flutters down upon being dislodged by your many, many eyerolls in response to this high-order top-shelf lobotomized nincompooped drivel."
rotten,It is a rather boring sequel that gets lost uselessly between chases and computer-generated dinosaurs. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,So…locusts? They really went with locusts?
rotten,A genetically-engineered generic blockbuster is the weakest chapter in the uninspired new trilogy.
rotten,"In spite of all the positive elements, it’s unfortunate the film’s biggest obstacle is its own story."
rotten,"If ever there was a franchise that proved box office glory wasn't enough to greenlight sequels, this is it. One masterpiece and a handful of middling to bad facsimiles. At least it's over."
fresh,"Despite too many characters, iffy pacing and an excessive runtime, this is just an enjoyably loud, dumb summer action film. More horror would have been appreciated, but the Malta sequence alone makes this worth a recommend."
fresh,"Despite its extremely messy story, if looked at as a '50s B-movie matinee, it's not too bad."
rotten,The scenes are disjointed; the film lacks heart as not enough focus is given to the main characters’ story.
rotten,"Director Colin Trevorrow just about limps over the finishing line with Dominion and while the script probably needed another round of edits, he directs the film with enough passion towards the franchise that it’ll do just fine."
fresh,"Even if the movie as a whole isn’t good (and it isn’t, not really), it doesn’t matter, because it definitely delivers on the dinosaurs, and hey – if you’re not down for various flavors of dino-action, then what are we even doing here?"
rotten,"As you can probably tell by now, the narrative resembles a ball of wool after a confrontation with a baby raptor."
fresh,A chaotic film spectacle – but fun while it lasts.
rotten,"Jurassic World Dominion is a devolution, and primarily shows that bloated blockbuster franchises keep finding a way to chew up screens, time and attention, no matter the consequences."
rotten,You've got two plots fighting with each other as opposed to working with each other... It constantly feels like I'm ping-ponging between two different movies.
fresh,"It was entertaining, I guess. It wasn't terrible. It wasn't the worst of the series. It wasn't the best."
rotten,"Goldblum aside, it's hard not to feel that the warm-blooded actors are phoning it in a bit."
fresh,"The Jurassic World of ever-diminishing returns, for me this was sadly a case of just not enough blood left to pump authentic storytelling through the veins of a waning franchise. For young dino devotees though this should be diverting enough."
fresh,"As for special effects, they are quite good and bring the audience into a world that looks real and exciting."
rotten,"It is, I’m sorry to say, like watching your favourite band reunite on the world’s biggest stage only to discover that their instruments are out of tune and the roadies have gone home."
rotten,"An over-stuffed, over-long creature feature that strays so far from the wonder that first enchanted us that it's hard to see the connective tissue to its predecessor."
rotten,For the final film of a very successful franchise you expect more - much more.
fresh,"If you are wanting a fun film that you don’t have to think too hard about, this is it."
rotten,"In order to keep visual track of all the famous faces, the sweeping vistas that defined the first Jurassic Park film have been chopped up into ‘80s TV-styled midrange shots, leaving a gazillion-dollar production looking cheap."
rotten,"This is a feature that is painful to watch. It does nothing with the intriguing world it takes place in and hopes that cheap nostalgia will be enough to get audiences to enjoy the product it is delivering, something not even close to true."
rotten,How many ways can you screw up a dinosaur movie?
rotten,"There are some stunning visuals and the new dinosaurs are terrific, especially the one that looks like an angry chicken; though they often seem like extras in an overlong potboiler thriller."
rotten,"Dominion answers the question ""What if dinosaurs became so commonplace they were no longer exciting?"" by making even the most unique dinosaur encounters so routine and uninspiring that even the people involved cannot muster enthusiasm to be frightened."
fresh,"While there’s never really a sense of true danger for our heroes, we get just enough of the range of CGI dinosaurs and their weird traits to keep the film entertaining."
rotten,"The latest Jurassic Park sequel is exhausted and running on fumes. Big, loud, annoying fumes."
rotten,A decidedly underwhelming sequel...
fresh,"The film remains engaging enough, if rather safe."
fresh,"It feels more like one of the later entries in the Fast and the Furious franchise than a Jurassic Park/World film, but if you can accept that then you're in for a loud, long and dumb ride that's also a lot of fun."
rotten,"JURASSIC PARK was a gift to cinema and truly pushed filmmaking forward. Unfortunately, every sequel experienced the law of diminishing returns. Jurassic World Dominion was no different."
rotten,An ugly franchise entry that feels like a contractual obligation by an employee full of hatred. Easily the worst film in the JP universe.
fresh,"This is not one of those awful dark, depressing films about an impending genetic apocalypse, although it could have easily been turned into that with a few minor tweaks. This is an entertaining romp, loaded with action, nostalgia and special effects."
fresh,"Two and a half hours of the purest adventure with no filters, no breaks, and with a heart as big as the head of a T-Rex."
rotten,It's big and dumb.
rotten,"Dominion closes the Jurassic World saga worse than expected, wasting legacy characters and trying to squeeze two movies into one, but having none of them focusing on the core elements that made this saga great. A trilogy dumbed down to unexpected levels."
fresh,Jurassic World Dominion is an aggressively fine and mostly enjoyable romp that does some things well and others things less so. It’s the epitome of just OK.
fresh,"Sloppy screenplay reduces dinosaurs to costars in their own movie, delivers decent fan service and great fx if not a fully satisfying film."
rotten,“Jurassic World: Dominion” roars into movie theaters with creative exhaustion nipping at its rapacious dinosaur jaws. The only sense of awe is associated with the aw-shucks disappointment of a missed opportunity.
rotten,"Jurassic World Dominion is not a good movie, but in the midst of so much mediocrity, there's some fascinating—albeit breathtakingly silly—worldbuilding that demands to be unpacked."
rotten,"The movie’s greatest miscalculation—and I haven’t even gotten to its misuse of its mostly-wonderful cast—is to regard the behemoths as ordinary wildlife, leaving the film completely lacking in moments."
rotten,"Nostalgia only gets you so far, and beleaguered director Colin Trevorrow comes close to ruining a legacy."
fresh,"Although the lessons about co-existence are clunky, this is a mostly satisfying film for fans of the franchise."
rotten,"Granted there are a few threatening dinosaur muzzles here and there, but the movie doesn't dare to sacrifice any of its characters, we're beholding the softest adventure in this saga. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"While stuffed with set pieces, Treverrow still lacks the skill to set them up or pay them off. Plus what use are they when no character feels endangered from the creatures we’re no longer sure are that menacing."
rotten,"A disjointed mess, plagued by a MacGuffin-filled plot, mediocre action sequences, and a lack of dramatic stakes."
rotten,A Jurassic World film where dinosaurs are now free and interacting with the modern world shouldn’t feel this long-winded or this tiresome. Dominion is running on fumes as it tries to offer something new from what is otherwise dried up fossil fuel.
rotten,"A creative low point, even by the dead-horse-flogging standards of the previous sequels to Steven Spielberg’s groundbreaking original."
fresh,Does the plot make sense? Of course not. But the effects are so impressive that even those with dimming affection for this venerable series will feel satisfied with the result.
rotten,"Jurassic World Dominion is overstuffed with characters, lore, plot points, and even action sequences that fail to be exciting, but its greatest flaw is that it’s too obsessed with recalling Jurassic Park for its own good."
fresh,Fallen Kingdom broke my brain so fundamentally that I walked away being able to mostly enjoy Dominion as a popcorn flick. Unfortunate that the dinosaurs are essentially bookends to the story and a minor inconvenience.
fresh,"Jurassic World Dominion is far from where we started in 1993, but I believe the world is big enough to have both kinds of blockbusters. It’s an extremely flawed but admirable effort, full of dumb cheesy moments, plenty of action, and really cool dinos."
rotten,"'Dominion' loses the soul of 'Jurassic Park,' action sequences are downright ugly as dino VFX can't keep up with the ""Wannabe Mission Impossible"" cinematography, and it's overall just the worst kind of manufactured blockbuster cash-in."
fresh,"Operating at a full-tilt pace, this sequel is packed with exciting action scenes, has a solid story, compelling bad guys, and features dinosaurs aplenty. In other words, it's everything you’d want out of a summer popcorn flick."
rotten,"Jurassic World Dominion is really like being at the biggest, best buffet on the planet and choosing to eat nothing but plain lettuce."
rotten,JWD prioritizes fanservice over telling a cogent tale with actual emotional stakes.
rotten,"A long, tiring, winding road."
rotten,The most concerning takeaway is that director Colin Trevorrow wholeheartedly believes he made a great film here.
rotten,"The last time dinosaurs were subjected to a disaster this bad, there was an asteroid involved."
rotten,"Not enough dinosaurs, and too much B.D. Wong all sad in a frumpy sweater."
rotten,Those dastardly dinos are back (yawn).
rotten,Jurassic World: Dominion has its moments but they are few and far between. Revisit the first film instead.
rotten,"Dinosaurs walk the Earth, but Jurassic World Dominion gives bugs dominion over the plot. It’s like watching a Godzilla movie where people fend off huge termites while avoiding Godzilla’s feet and atomic breath. ... massively disappointing."
rotten,"The film gets the bands back together, merging two trilogies in meagre ways, but never quite sure what it wants to be - Eco revenge tale? Western fantasy? Family drama? Ironic sequel? End result is mixed, but still packs some bite"
rotten,"Jurassic World Dominion is not interesting but full of cliches. And, while humans have aged remarkably well, time hasn’t been kind to the dinosaurs..."
fresh,"Like a classic Frank Capra film, ""Dominion"" believes in the basic goodness of the common person, especially peripheral characters such as Dodgson's right-hand man Ramsay Cole..."
rotten,The latest Jurassic World trades suspense for nostalgia.
rotten,Jurassic World Dominion reeks of a series that has run out of steam and has nothing left but the fumes of its past triumphs to keep it on the road. Sadly it seems that it's time for this particular franchise to go extinct.
rotten,"The dinosaurs really aren't the focus of the film, which is how Dominion will likely lose viewers who come to watch man fight the prehistoric giants, not man wrestle with moral ambiguity and an impending worldwide famine."
fresh,Its not about the humans…what I enjoyed the most was the freaking dinosaurs.
rotten,It felt like a lot of ideas and they couldn’t pick the best ones.
rotten,"The prehistoric creatures are thriving, but this sixth installment in the  Jurassic series feels tired..."
rotten,"With its narrative whiplash, the latest legacy sequel begs the question, why not watch the original instead?"
fresh,"Compared to its predecessor, its the most worthwhile to watch…Trevorrow and his team have assembled a variety of spooky dinosaurs, both classic and new. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"A fun film with little surprises. People looking for a family film will be happy, but I'm still figuring out my feelings on this ending. It almost feels like the end of the Terminator series, have we outgrown or jumped the Jurassic shark?"
rotten,"Dominion features some fun set pieces, mostly charismatic actors, and decent VFX work. It also features a bloated mess of a screenplay and a lead performance that feels curiously inert."
rotten,Jurassic World Dominion does next to nothing with what it has nor does it feel like any kind of real finale to what began with the 1993 original or even Trevorrow’s own 2015 reboot.
rotten,"You can round up the old gang for the first time in three decades, mix them up with the new gang who’ve been at it for the past seven years, but if you can’t give them all decent dialogue and a powerful story… well, it’s just not going to happen."
rotten,I think the best thing for the franchise now is to remain like its dinosaur counterparts… extinct!
fresh,"Jurassic World Dominion is not a high point for the franchise, but it’s still reasonably entertaining and delivers where the real stars, the dinosaurs, are concerned."
fresh,"Arguably least satisfying and it ends more on a philosophical note, still, there's plenty of fun to be had. Serving up familiar terrors and new thrills on a nostalgic platter, “Jurassic World Dominion” is a quintessential summer blockbuster."
rotten,"All concerned have made the audacious decision to relegate the dinosaurs – the marquee attractions, to the status of background extras."
rotten,"Generic sequel squanders killer cast, overloads on slick CGI dinosaurs."
rotten,Ho hum.
rotten,"Because it brings back the human characters who propelled previous installments, it's sentimental, yet it's overstuffed and superficial - resulting in no emotional connection."
rotten,"The weakest of the Jurassic World trilogy. It feels like they keep puling back from what we want to see, especially considering the set up the last movie gave us."
rotten,"A movie that preys on nostalgia but doesn’t know what to do with any of it, and a film with a massive scale that gets pared down to the same tricks as before, Jurassic World Dominion brings the franchise to an unsatisfying close."
rotten,It’s the equivalent of Colin Trevorrow banging pots and pans for two and a half hours to keep you distracted from the fact that nothing you’re seeing really means anything.
rotten,"Despite the long-awaited return of the beloved trio of characters, this chaotic and inconsequential entry leads the saga straight to extinction. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,Goldblum... has flashes of the requisite Goldblum irritation while dressed and lit as a seventy-year-old leather-jacketed version of Bob Fosse’s serpent from Stanley Donen’s 'The Little Prince.'
rotten,When Foe is finished — when fires both figurative and literal have been extinguished and we know (or at least think we know) what has become of Hen and Junior — we’re simply left wanting more from the experience.
fresh,"There is no telling where Foe will take you, but it will be a long, hard fall; either to the pits of despair or desire, ambivalence galore"
fresh,"An unsettling combination of sci-fi, horror and intimate drama that is evoked by two terrific young actors and enhanced by lovely work on camera, but the big picture concerns the narrative explores needed strengthening at the writing stage"
rotten,Foe initially presented as a sc-fi but settled into a relationship film where we meet the couple at the fragmented stage. The singular focus was its weakness but the strong performances are without question.
rotten,"There was potentially an engaging film in this material, but the fuse burns slowly from start to finish, and nothing ever goes bang."
rotten,"Overall, the film must be counted as a disappointment, though there are interesting ­elements to this futuristic drama."
rotten,"Foe takes an eternity to arrive at the most obvious developments that will arise from such a concept. The actors try hard throughout, but the movie gives up the ghost way too early."
rotten,"Although Davis obtains notable powerful performances from his leading duo, the experiment sadly turns out to be insipid, confusing and unnecessary, and a real scam as futuristic cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,A literal and figurative hot mess.
rotten,"Foe tries to go deep but only half succeeds. It’s like a replicant of an art movie, almost convincing, but never quite hitting the thematic high notes that could have lifted it from the grey zone..."
rotten,I liked the part where clone Paul Mescal gets shrink-wrapped.
rotten,"Not since 2015’s By the Sea have we seen such an epic waste of acting talent in what could, and should, have been a captivating portrait of a marriage in disintegration. Foe is tedious."
rotten,"“Foe” misfires in many ways, but it’s not an interesting failure, with Davis determined to transform the viewing experience into a grueling sit."
rotten,"Beautifully shot, this lightly futuristic romantic thriller centres tightly on three characters who are skilfully played with intense emotionality. But filmmaker Garth Davis tries to be tricky with a plot that simply doesn't hold water."
fresh,"While it’s frustrating that the film is overdependent on its structural puzzle, it's easy to appreciate how Ronan and Mescal set the screen ablaze."
rotten,"The actors deserve a medal for babbling so much convoluted claptrap with a straight face. Written and directed by Garth Davis from a 2018 novel I never want to read by Iain Reid, Foe is not just a bad dream. It’s a colossal nightmare."
fresh,"Mescal and Ronan are captivating: her watchful, raw-nerved longing; his stinging sense of betrayal."
rotten,Joyless characters deliver endlessly pretentious babble.
rotten,"In keeping with the central theme of the film itself, you don’t want to entirely abandon it just because there is so much that is broken and needs to be fixed. The trouble is that it doesn't have the verve or the patience to rebuild something of its own."
fresh,Foe deals with prescient ideas concerning manipulation and freedom in compelling ways even if it doesn’t tie everything together satisfactorily.
fresh,"Foe is a film that becomes stranger, richer, and more troubling the longer it goes on. All three actors admirably create an atmosphere of distrust and distress, with Mescal and Ronan especially excelling."
rotten,It’s an A for effort. But it’s just not enough.
fresh,It’s hard not to admire a film that so determinedly zigs when you would expect it to zag.
fresh,"An emotional, if familiar, take on loyalty and technology in a world where love and survival feel near-impossible. Reid’s writing shines and there’s nobody better than Mescal and Ronan to broadcast heartbreak."
rotten,"Foe by name, faux by nature."
rotten,"The young cast is mesmerizing, but all this dusty dystopia has is vibes and vague metaphors. It only just barely touches on the potential of its science-fiction ideas to explore the human condition."
rotten,"In the end, Garth Davis’s ambitious but rather stagey drama has the elliptical dullness of late period Terrence Malick, and squanders interesting ideas about science and our scary future by refusing to develop them."
rotten,"The twist is so sneaky, in fact, the film might require a second viewing to fully appreciate (detest?) the level of manipulation at work here."
rotten,"A fascinating premise running on just vibes and movie star charisma, the sci-fi drama 'Foe' barely registers a pulse."
rotten,"There’s a big twist towards the end here—but strangely it doesn’t really change the central dynamic, which is tediously atonal. We"
rotten,… a load of ho-hum hokum.
rotten,"FOE turns out to have very little to do with the scant science fiction trappings of the story. Instead, it’s about how difficult it is for two married people to stay together."
rotten,"Playing off the very contemporaneous– dare I say trendy– topic of artificial intelligence going around in movies, the whole elevator pitch of ""Foe"" from Garth Davis paradoxically dangles both obviousness and intrigue."
fresh,"For me, this was an enjoyable, intimate film and something I’d watch again."
fresh,"A sci-fi movie playing in the same sandbox as Blade Runner and Moon, Foe ultimately succeeds as a marriage story about tending to relationships like dying planets, and the people would just as soon abandon their duties to both of those things."
fresh,There’s a lot of good in Foe. It’s full of incredibly interesting ideas and pulls great performances out of all three of its actors. But it’s trying to be too many things at once and in so doing prevents itself from totally fulfilling any of its promises.
rotten,"Pushing this hard for intellect is just painful, and that is the lasting feeling of Foe."
rotten,"Foe, starring Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan, should be an event to celebrate. Instead, it's a sci-fi story that's been told a thousand times."
rotten,"A murky, pretentious bore, like a script for “The Twilight Zone” that Rod Serling would have tossed into the wastebasket...the level of expertise that’s been lavished on it...makes its abject failure all the more dispiriting."
fresh,Foe offers an intriguing take on marriage. It’s a slow burn & sometimes confusing film with an emotionally gutting twist that is worth it in the end.
rotten,"Foe fails to extract any true emotions, lacking in characters to care about, nor having clarity in what it’s trying to say about our future."
fresh,"There is an unshakable and electric hum to Foe that ensures director Garth Davis’s work will stay with audiences attuned to its distinct frequency for days, months, perhaps ages."
rotten,"Perhaps on paper, this story felt as stark and bleakly evocative as the forsaken world that surrounds its principal characters. On screen, it’s like a million things you’ve seen before."
rotten,"Despite its big ideas about AI, climate change, and what the future holds for human existence, this sci-fi drama never manages to take off."
fresh,"Adapted from a novel by Iain Reid (who co-wrote the screenplay with Davis), it has the same sense of contained mystery as Charlie Kaufman’s adaptation of Reid’s I’m Thinking of Ending Things, albeit without the overt surrealism, humor, and media satire."
rotten,"Foe presents one of the messiest screenplays of the year, filled with incessant, unnecessary explanations, abruptly confusing time shifts, absurdly devoid of any impact, and a strange message about the superiority of AI in human intimate relationships."
rotten,"At best, it’s a failed adaptation of a successful novel, a medium that better serves esoteric monologues and blatant symbolism, that throws the book’s ideas at the screen without ensuring they’re properly couched in an emotionally compelling narrative."
rotten,"Davis, though, is shooting for something far grander: a kind of claustrophobic, The Shining-style psychological horror. Sadly he has neither the script nor the imagination to do this."
rotten,"... The thinness of its plot leaves the film itself feeling somewhat like another’s blank-slate doppelgänger: the mood persuades, but sci-fi cannot live by vibes alone."
rotten,"Foe is less a sci-fi film than a three-character psychological suspense play with deceit. Director Garth Davis (Lion) doesn’t mix up the moods all that well, though Ronan and Mescal are believable as a not-quite-compatible but still loving couple."
rotten,A production that unfortunately squanders the talents of Mescal and Ronan and its gorgeous production values.
rotten,The whole thing plays like a post-apocalyptic sci-fi flick directed by Terrence Malick: all talk bordering on pretentious poetry and close-ups of body parts.
fresh,"[Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan] give us the lot: tenderness and jealousy, joy and devastation, agonised silences and scorching sex scenes."
fresh,We’ve had robo-doppelgänger and bleak futurescapes before but it’s Mescal and Ronan who make this story sing.
rotten,"AI in a dystopian rural America couldn’t be a more current subject. Despite the subject matter and setting, even Saoirse Ronan with Paul Mescal, committed as they are in the lead as a devoted couple, can’t save this confusing film."
fresh,"With lush visuals and performances just as thriving, any shortcomings can be forgiven for a sci-fi romance that has its heart in the right place."
fresh,"Is Foe overly self-indulgent and clunky? Sure. Love can be like that sometimes. For better or worse, Foe is a dystopian and dysfunctional love story for our modern times."
rotten,"Overall, Foe feels like a letdown by taking a promising premise and its talented cast and creating a misguided romance amid a hollow thriller. Ronan, Mescal and Pierre save this from being a disaster - but deserve better."
rotten,Foe is a misfire in almost every aspect and both numbingly dull and ridiculously obvious.
rotten,"I believed Ronan and Pescal as two people bound up in love, shared history and torment. As much as I was as glad as anybody when “Foe” finally ended, those two unhappy people have stayed with me."
rotten,Foe should be peering into the future instead of being distracted by domestic woes better explored in films not pretending to be about something else.
rotten,"What was once haunting and unsettling on the book page has not, in more overt staging, translated well to the screen."
rotten,"Despite a capable cast and crew, Foe is a muddled mess that feels more like Black Mirror Lite than powerful sci-fi commentary."
rotten,"The saying is three’s a crowd, and that’s precisely what it feels like in this particular narrative."
rotten,This is a big letdown.
rotten,"[A] cumbersome film, whose feints at fun and friskiness are unnervingly forced."
rotten,"... bogs down in clumsy symbolism and heavy-handed melodrama as it funnels toward its big twist, becoming more tedious than provocative."
rotten,"[Mescal] and Ronan make for a pretty picture, but there’s simply nothing going on beneath the surface."
rotten,"With everything going for this dystopian thriller about humans being replaced by replicants, including two hottie Irish Oscar nominees in Saorise Ronan and Paul Mescal as young marrieds in crisis, this sci-fi misfire hits theaters as an epic botch job."
fresh,“Foe” is a unique look at the age-old tragedy of a failing marriage and what happens when love isn’t enough to save everything.
rotten,Garth Davis spends a tediously painful amount of time trying to trick and confuse audiences when there are far more compelling elements to address and delve into
rotten,"Foe knows the tale it wants to tell. But because of the often mannered, occasionally stagy way that it ends up telling it, this is a movie that has a tendency to be its own worst enemy."
rotten,"What begins as a sleek, science-fiction-tinged mystery leaves little more than a cloud of dust."
rotten,It’s a would-be thought-starter about the nature of love and the soul that inspires no thought and a romance that stirs no passion despite near-constant onscreen lovemaking.
rotten,"It’s the quintessential example of a movie completely built around its twist, thus forcing the script to withhold information from the audience until it’s time for the big reveal."
rotten,"Ronan and Mescal do not stint on their respective talents for digging deep emotionally, but the film about a disintegrating marriage is wrapped within a clunky sci-fi shell which distracts more than it illuminates."
rotten,A turgid sci-fi mope-fest.
rotten,"Lackluster, undercooked and vapid despite fine performances and exquisite cinematography."
rotten,"Davis’ attempts at psychological thrills only turn melodramatic, while his attempts at tapping into deeper philosophical and ethical questions come off as baffling."
fresh,"Foe plays to the strengths of its actors, two of the most natural and subtle on screen, and is endlessly engaging even though it eventually stumbles into head-spinning narrative problems."
rotten,Foe must be what happens when you build a movie around a plot twist. It’s the only way to explain how this soft science-fiction story goes from dreadfully boring to painfully baffling within its last twenty minutes.
rotten,“Foe” stumbles rather spectacularly by leaning more on melodrama than logic and choosing cliche over originality.
rotten,Dull futuristic sci-fi film.
rotten,A sci-fi story that spirals about in circles on its way to a predictable and underwhelming twist and an even less satisfying conclusion.
fresh,A powerful lament to a way of life in danger of being permanently lost.
rotten,"Once Foe goes hammy, it becomes propulsive in a way that’s hard to look away from. The story refuses to end and we’re just here to watch it crash and burn. It always looks good, though."
rotten,"Those tonal and narrative decisions render the emotional story beats not only ineffective, but inadvertently comedic."
rotten,"The pretentiously dull sci-fi drama Foe wants to say a lot about humans choosing between living on Earth or living somewhere else, but fails to tell anything substantial about the couple at the center of the story. Good acting can't save this weak script."
fresh,"Foe manages to convey its messy ideas through Paul Mescal, Aaron Pierre, and especially Saorise Ronan."
fresh,"Not all of it works, but the rich, emotional layers allow this movie to be one of the best science fiction films of the year."
rotten,"It’s difficult to overstate how badly Foe fumbles its heady premise and firecracker cast, a film so dependent on its biggest secret that it’s both predictable and hard to grasp by the time the trigger is finally pulled."
rotten,"There is indeed some attempt at substance here, but it's buried under layers of nonsensical storytelling and clumsy dialogue. Not even its prestigious stars can sell it."
fresh,"Mescal and Ronan both excel at sinking into themselves, with the latter’s irrepressible force of will squeezing against the walls of the musty farmhouse as if her life were a shoe five sizes too small."
rotten,"The trouble with the movie is that once you’re confronted with the surprise, and you think back over what you’ve been watching, it makes even less sense."
rotten,"Initially unsettling but steadily devolves into sappiness, confusion and self-important solemnity."
rotten,"There’s plenty of ambition and talent, but without the crisp engine of story, it’s as dry as 2065 dirt."
rotten,"You can see where this story could work – the character arcs are there but hacked to bits; the world-building is intriguing but inconsistent – but between the pages of Reid’s novel and the images of Davis’s film, something has gotten lost in translation."
rotten,"""Foe"" is a film drowned in under-delivered aspirations and aggressive narrative ennui."
rotten,"A mess of concepts, issues, and messages, an amalgamation of errors in tone and story."
rotten,"It’s a shame that the script can’t manage the world-building and character development, as Mescal and Ronan are so well-suited to tackle a thorny marriage drama."
rotten,"At every turn, Garth Davis’s Foe not only fails to adequately redress or rework played-out tropes within its high-concept world, but its examination of marriage and identity is also hackneyed."
fresh,Guy Ritchie fun with a cast of fun characters!  Aubrey Plaza steals the show
fresh,...what makes Operation Fortune feel like a less intensive but a lot funnier Mission Impossible-type adventure is Ritchie’s ability to apply his macho humor and the gimmicky visual stylishness that became his trademark over the years.
rotten,"More like John Le Carre: Operation Bankrupt as Ritchie can never tap into Statham's knack for humor, lets Josh Hartnett flail about and, worst of all, hangs Aubrey Plaza out to dry to figure out for herself if she is playing legit or parody."
rotten,"Operation Fortune finds Guy Ritchie sticking with what he knows best, even if the end result suggests that he might be losing some of his mojo."
rotten,The setup promises a rollicking ruse but the script is seriously lacking wit despite having a fun ensemble cast.
rotten,"... The diverse, miserable, and occasionally funny characters are immersed in a plot that never fully convinces. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A frustraingly damp and discordant caper, with a capable cast done a disservice due to haphazard editing and an underdeveloped script. A mess, and a shame."
rotten,It’s like someone doing Guy Ritchie doing Guy Ritchie.
rotten,Flashy but hollow...
fresh,"...a familiar yet mostly entertaining spy caper that’s elevated, on a remarkably consistent basis, by the agreeable, affable performances..."
fresh,"…Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre provides a nice, smooth, undemanding watch, elevated by another killer performance from Hugh Grant in peak form…"
fresh,"With a shoes-clicking-on-marble start that’s pure Burn After Reading, and some saucy surveillance games that reminded me of Sneakers, Ritchie plans his menu with familiar ingredients."
fresh,... The colourful script repeatedly rescues the lagging by poking fun and delivering on real humour.
fresh,The film is mostly content to watch Statham perform some nifty beat-downs before introducing us to a scene-and-movie-stealing Hugh Grant... as a buffoonish arms dealer apparently slathered in Donald Trump’s fake tan.
fresh,Guy Ritchie barely puts a foot wrong with his solid but largely forgettable spy caper.
fresh,Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre works wonderfully as an entertaining popcorn flick.
rotten,"The breakneck pace, and endless sequences of people typing and texting, overlong, deadening fight sequences seem regressive, but Plaza's energy and brightness raises Ritchie's retro effort"
fresh,"Riper than the ripest of ripe Brie, this crime caper provides a ridiculous vehicle for the talents of pretty much everyone involved, all of whom appear to be having a splendid time."
fresh,Director and co-writer Guy Ritchie’s buoyant spy caper and franchise non-starter Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre is a fine enough movie to watch on a weekend afternoon when one has nothing better to do.
rotten,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre feels like a Xerox copy of the movies that made Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham famous. The sum of its parts is a bland espionage story that is, at best, serviceable."
rotten,'Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre' is a series of bad decisions caught on camera. Avoid at all costs.
rotten,"... Proceedings trundle chaotically along until the whole thing comes to a sputtering close, as if all involved just decided to call it quits and hit the nearest bar."
rotten,"Were it not for the presence of Hugh Grant, Guy Ritchie’s awkwardly titled international crime thriller would be easily forgotten."
fresh,"""Operation Fortune” hits the mark. The cast is very good, with extra points to Aubrey Plaza, who is especially appealing in a tongue-in-cheek role that could have been tedious, but happily, is breezy and entertaining."
rotten,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre offers modest escapist pleasures – a bit of witty banter, a glitzy car chase and an oleaginous Hugh Grant performance – but little more than that."
fresh,"The title may be unwieldy, its plot inconsequential, and its behind-the-scenes backstory bizarre, this is an entertaining action romp."
fresh,"It's pretty well done... It does deliver on what it does, and it's got really good light touches."
rotten,"Operation Fortune stalls after a relatively promising opening and never recovers. By the end, I was completely disengaged from what was happening on screen."
fresh,A weightless and dizzying globetrotting caper that still delivers a refreshing dose of cheeky entertainment.
fresh,"Thoroughly superficial, Guy Ritchie's globetrotting action/adventure is nonetheless consistently swift and light, and the fun that the cast seems to be having on-screen is contagious."
fresh,"Audrey Plaza, being very Vanessa Kirby-ish, is a delight to watch."
fresh,Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre is a consistently entertaining action spy thriller carried by Jason Statham’s combination of brute-force action and deadpan comic relief.
rotten,"Operation Fortune instead finds Ritchie in Man from U.N.C.L.E. mode, a breezy contraption that isn’t necessarily good, but never reaches the barrel bottom."
fresh,"“Operation Fortune” is the kind of breezy spy game that’s fun to watch, despite plot shortcomings, because the cast appears to work well with each other. They could get the gang together again, and it wouldn’t be that far-fetched."
fresh,"Parts of the movie are unimaginative but somehow still fun, which is most likely a testament to the director (who has always had his finger firmly on the pulse of what action fans want) and the cast of actors who are obviously having a good time."
fresh,What appealed to me were the scenes between Florence Pugh and Morgan Freeman. They seemed natural and at ease.
rotten,"Most of the characters, by the way, are very well dressed. [But] don’t get me wrong, I’m not recommending Operation Fortune..."
fresh,"Guy Ritchie is back on the form we haven’t seen since his first two British gangster flicks, and channeling the glamour of his best movie – Man from UNCLE. A brilliant cast deliver one liners with aplomb, in this hugely enjoyable spy thriller caper."
fresh,"A breezily entertaining romp that makes many recent would-be peers look like…well, Statham’s films without Ritchie."
fresh,"For the most part, this is a fun time at the movies. There’s laughter, action, and movie stars playing to their strengths. It’s exactly what audiences expect to see from Ritchie and that’s its main selling point."
rotten,Bland is the best word I could use to describe Operation Fortune.
fresh,"Ritchie uses his usual mix of jagged editing, offbeat musical choices and achingly cool actors to liven everything up considerably."
rotten,So-so espionage tale.
rotten,"It serves no purpose other than unnecessarily extend the running time, which this film definitely doesn’t need. Ask me how I feel about Ritchie again in a month and a half, but I’m guessing it’ll be better than I do today."
rotten,"This smug and cliché-plagued action flick is proof that Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham have gotten lazy in their movie collaborations. The fights look too fake. The whole film is a failure of imagination, motivated by greed and paid trips to exotic places."
rotten,"Classic recent Ritchie: star-studded, snarky, and ultimately grating, lousy with weird glasses and bad accents. This thing is so slight, a Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox of a “Mission: Impossible” that it’s barely a movie."
rotten,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, on paper, is the quintessential Guy Ritchie picture, and yet it somehow falls to the bottom of the pack."
fresh,"Feels like the third or fourth installment of a forgotten franchise, one of those late-series entries where everybody’s happy to see each other again and nobody is going to be accused of over-exerting themselves. This is not a knock."
fresh,A serviceable chunk of entertainment that will probably work best with lowered expectations.
rotten,"“Operation Fortune” should be a Hartnett/Grant movie, not a Statham one. This snarky action comedy shines brightest when Grant and Hartnett are on screen."
rotten,"Ritchie decides that telling is more important than showing in this overly dry and formulaic take on the spy thriller. Statham is passable as yet another variant of his various other onscreen action personas, but it's sad to see Plaza wasted in her role."
rotten,"There’s less action than one might expect and the character development is so thin that even when a character is in danger, it’s hard to care."
fresh,"Everybody in Operation Fortune — yes, even Ritchie — seems to be having fun. Sometimes, that’s all you need."
fresh,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre is not a movie we need per se, but for those who are more than ho-hum enthusiasts of Guy Ritchie, it might have been just enough for them."
rotten,"More compelling in its setup than its payoff, there’s an underlying familiarity to the proceedings."
fresh,"Operation Fortune is a perfectly fine Guy Ritchie film, full of the requisite glam locations, sharp tailoring, and smug heroes, but Hugh Grant elevates this brisk, breezy action movie every minute he’s on screen."
rotten,"Judging from his latest, the English action director is trudging through the motions."
rotten,"This isn’t the worst imitation Bond knock-off you’ll ever see; there are far worse offenders in that category. But Operation Fortune doesn’t do Ritchie, his collaborators, or his cast any favors whatsoever."
rotten,"Action scenes feel slack.... Ritchie never allows viewers to get invested in the characters or the story.... The cast also seems underused.... The passable ""Operation Fortune"" is criminally ho-hum because Ritchie fails to deliver on its potential."
rotten,The Man From S.H.R.U.G. It’s like watching a cheap Kingsman knockoff; only it comes from the filmmaker arguably most influential to the things that made those movies fun.
rotten,"It’s still great to see Ritchie exploring his interests outside of the traditional studio framework with the same kind of panache he kicked off this decade with. Still, Operation Fortune can’t overcome the limitations of its genre forefathers."
rotten,"There's nothing to Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre to recommend to audiences who aren't already fans of Ritchie and his work, and even those who are, have better options out there."
fresh,"[W]hen the film doesn’t have a gun in its hand, it is so sure on its feet, and silver-tongued one can forgive many of its failures."
rotten,"Best described as, and I shudder as I type this, conventional.  Adamantly conventional. So conventional that I found myself hoping that Ritchie was making a statement about conventionality that would pay off at some point. It’s called grasping at straws."
fresh,"Not awful, but don't let this Guy anywhere near a real Bond movie."
rotten,"There are elements of parody, but ""Operation Fortune"" is not broad enough to be a spoof. It's weirdly empty."
fresh,"While hardly up there with Ritchie’s sharpest romps, Operation Fortune still delivers more than enough witty repartee and slickly efficient action to satisfy."
rotten,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre can’t be taken seriously, or humorously."
rotten,"Things and people explode without consequence. And Statham, squinting manfully into the void, walks away unscathed, keen to throat-punch another day."
rotten,"If you want to sit back and watch a Guy Ritchie action spy comedy that also stars Hugh Grant, just watch “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.”"
rotten,"...a movie that feels like it should be cool but isn't...a movie so high on its own supply that it becomes grating, not charismatic, the longer it slogs on."
fresh,A Guy Ritchie movie through and through. It’s a film that features what fans like about his movies as well as what frustrates his detractors. How much mileage you get out it will probably depend on which side you fall on.
rotten,"Statham is overshadowed by Aubrey Plaza and Hugh Grant in this too-average actioner. It would be nice to see him stretch a bit, or even face a worthy opponent some time."
rotten,"Either Ritchie didn’t bring his typical slickness for the ride, or he’s chopped up Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre intentionally to take the piss out of the genre. The effect at least feels more like comfort than boredom."
fresh,"If I could put it into a box I'd say it's his attempt at a MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE filtered through the humorous lens utilized on THE GENTLEMEN. It may not be enough to petition for a sequel, but it's a lot of fun for fans of Ritchie's usual formula."
rotten,"Orson Fortune is an agent who'll only fly private and only drink ""the finest clarets."" I don't know about anyone else, but I don't think of Jason Statham as a ""finest clarets"" kind of guy."
fresh,Nothing we haven’t seen before and won’t see again but done with just enough playful ebullience for it to go down smoothly.
fresh,"Operation Fortune is essentially an off-brand Bond flick, and a sufficiently skilled one to offer an amusing, relaxing couple of hours free of substance and ethics."
rotten,"While it has all the requisite elements for an action thriller, “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” excels at none of them."
rotten,The cast is big and eventually there is a bit of enjoyable action but Operation Fortune is a lot of fools gold.
rotten,"A mildly engaging spy thriller with a dull plot and not enough laughs, suspense, thrills or zaniness."
fresh,It’s Mission: Impossible with British people talking in Guy Ritchie accents.
rotten,"... What should be a gas ends up feeling leadfooted, especially in the film's cumbersome third act."
rotten,Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre isn’t a complete failure ... but the majority is a limp affair that never fully engages.
rotten,"A generic collage of mega-yachts, luxe hotels, fancy parties, disguised identities and tame fights that add up to a big nothing."
fresh,"Operation Fortune is a perfectly fine mid-budget thriller that aspires to do nothing more than deliver pure, unadulterated entertainment."
fresh,"It’s cockamamie from beginning to end, but shows a real appreciation for wanting to entertain its audience. Mission accomplished."
rotten,Guy Ritchie’s stylish but ultimately frustratingly half-baked spy caper.
fresh,"The awkwardly titled Operation Fortune: Ruse De Guerre is loads of fun, an entertaining spy thriller that is faithful to the genre, very well cast, and a hoot to watch."
rotten,A slick but old-fashioned spy extravaganza weighed down by an uncharismatic lead turn and a plot no cleverer than the title.
fresh,"A breezy, old-school Guy Ritchie action romp."
fresh,"Operation Fortune is a heck of a lot more fun than it has any right to be, and based on how much I despised the first act, I’m as flabbergasted about this as anyone."
rotten,"The silly premise is one that a better Ritchie film could, with some charm, style and wit, have turned into a workable romp. But everything here is stuck on autopilot."
rotten,"The style and panache of Guy Ritchie are certainly here in Operation Fortune: Ruse de guerre, although it feels subdued and neutered, as if it’s afraid to embrace his typical hyperactive energy and the lunacy of this plot"
fresh,"Per usual, boasting a very talented cast and a clever, fast-paced script, this is another action-packed Guy Ritchie thriller with enough humor to keep everyone engaged."
fresh,OPERATION FORTUNE: RUSE DE GUERRE is an entertaining romp accompanied by equal parts mayhem.
rotten,[T]he movie ... never rises above the level of a generic thriller with some bits of comedy sprinkled into the mix.
rotten,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre is the latest in a long line of diminishing returns for Ritchie, made mildly diverting through the strength of its performances even as a central spy mystery struggles to give reason why it’s worth investing in."
fresh,Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre gives a talented cast latitude to shine. Guy Ritchie never allows one performance to overshadow the others. He orchestrates ensemble success in a fun storyline that's action-packed.
fresh,"So, kick off your shoes, lay back, have a cocktail and plan to have some fun, even if there is nothing original here."
rotten,“Operation Fortune” feels perfunctory and a great idea that somehow fell apart somewhere along the line. The cast does its best with what they’ve got but only so much can be done.
rotten,"By about the halfway mark, one loses interest in the plot of this larky, comedic action thriller, but whoever managed to sign Aubrey Plaza should get a bonus as the actress’s snarky line readings maintain interest far longer than this film deserves."
rotten,"While the director's love of craft can be seen in everything from the costumes to casting, it fails to extend to the performances—outside of [Hugh] Grant's."
rotten,"It’s an appetizer for better things to come, an amuse-bouche at best — at worst, a placeholder meal of cinematic comfort food, tiding us all over until it’s summer blockbuster season again."
fresh,"As the ever-reliable Jason Statham and Hugh Grant go head to head, Plaza steals the show with her killer instincts and comedic timing. If she can keep an operation this overstuffed afloat, there’s nothing she cannot do."
fresh,Operation Fortune is a kick to the ass of the spy genre.
rotten,"Not even its dousing in Statham/Plaza sauce could spice this movie up, but the Hugh Grant x Josh Hartnett spin-off it hints at would be appreciated."
rotten,"Statham's schtick ain’t Shakespeare, but he does elevate meaty, muscle-bound macho to a kind of movie art form."
fresh,"Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre gives us what we want from another Guy Ritchie and Jason Statham collaboration, even if they fall into formulaic espionage-comedy rhythms."
rotten,To call it formulaic would be insulting to formulas.
fresh,I could never escape the feeling that Guy Ritchie had trapped himself on a hamster wheel of trying too hard. I’ve liked a few of his films. But I’ve never loved one. Until now.
fresh,"A briskly-paced, entertaining picture whose colorful characters keep a needlessly complicated story afloat."
fresh,"Offers a decent fun factor and some Ritchie-branded pep, once again returning to the ways of sarcastic characters, imminent dangers, and short blasts of cheekiness."
fresh,Rarely before has a spy flick boasted protagonists who are never in any genuine danger.
rotten,"Disappointingly average, which is unacceptable for a director like Guy Ritchie who we know can (and expect to) bring style and flare. And if you're going to name your movie after the film's super spy, he's gotta be interesting and memorable, but he isn't."
rotten,"Perhaps middle age has made a couple of swagger veterans like Statham and Ritchie feel like they’ve earned the right to coast if the filming location is pretty enough, the action isn’t too demanding, and every fourth line has just enough sarcastic bite."
fresh,"Operation Fortune gives audiences what they want. The film is content to leave it at that, however. It does not try to reinvent the wheel. But sometimes plenty of action and Hugh Grant lighting up the screen is all you need."
fresh,Operation Fortune is a rich spy caper that cashes in every chip it has with such glee that it’s only further evidence as to why Ritchie should continue to play the spy game on a regular basis.
fresh,"The results are quite entertaining. The plotting is deceptively straightforward, and perhaps the runtime is a little longer than needed, but it’s hard to mind when one is having so much fun."
fresh,"It’s espionage executed with cheeky flair and playful sexiness, and it’s enlivened by Aubrey Plaza, who runs away with the show."
rotten,"Despite all of the beautiful cuisine and energetic kitchen chaos, “Burnt” is simply a half-baked redemption tale."
rotten,"Bradley Cooper plays a deplorable chef in a fatty, undercooked film."
rotten,Wells damns the film with an extra two minutes of demonstrably pat resolutions.
rotten,I was very underwhelmed with his journey.
rotten,Go watch Spinning Plates instead.
fresh,"Burnt is a harmless film that is just like a Whopper. It's good when you're with it, you'll most likely enjoy your time with it as well. Yet, if you think about it too much afterwards you may feel a bit bad about yourself."
rotten,"Barreling his way through scene after scene of sweary, shouty kitchen violence, the three-time Oscar nominee excels where the screenplay, script (and everything else) doesn't."
rotten,"Burnt is a mess disguised as a feel-good film, and not a very good one at that. Cooper's character is not someone you can root for and even the romance between he and Sienna Miller isn't genuine."
rotten,What could have been a Whiplash-style study of perfectionist obsession is diluted into a middling affair unsure which of its many flavours to plump for.
rotten,"While BURNT is unquestionably a feast for the senses, it's missing some of the core ingredients that keep us from truly savoring it."
rotten,"Burnt has a talented cast, and the ham-fisted script doesn't do them any favors."
rotten,"With watered down performances and underdeveloped storylines, ""Burnt"" needs a bit more seasoning, more time to rise and better ingredients to give us the melt-in-your-mouth film."
rotten,I'm sending it back.
rotten,The whole romantic subplot is really off putting.
rotten,"Burnt may be awash in enough images of gastronomic delight to satisfy any foodie, but dramatically it's as familiar and predictable as macaroni and cheese."
rotten,"The final presentation is quite clean and well composed, but lacking in passion to stimulate our narrative palates."
rotten,"We never doubt the direction of the plot because it remains consistent despite the hysterics behind the kitchen doors, thus consigning what could have been a great film to the realm of a competent one."
rotten,"If you're looking for a movie that really makes you salivate over life, love and saucepans, try Big Night or Mostly Martha. Burnt, alas, is mostly leftovers."
rotten,An under-cooked comedy about the food business.
fresh,Actually pretty watchable and fun.
rotten,"It's all too familiar, too rudimentary, and while the kitchen they're working in is top-of-the-line the meal they ultimately prepare isn't that much better than a Denny's breakfast left under the heat lamps a few minutes too many."
rotten,"Burnt is, to be clear, not a good movie. It is in fact a pretty terrible movie."
rotten,"Mostly, I thought Burnt was ridiculous. And yet I cannot tell a lie. Its familiar beats, comely cast, and lively kitchen montages entertained me."
rotten,"While 'Burnt' is totally predictable, and the terms 'slick' and 'feel-good' definitely apply, it'll still hold your attention."
rotten,"Not quite burnt then, but this dish could certainly do with greater depth and intensity of flavour."
fresh,"What does shine through though is Steven Knight's (Eastern Promises) pacey, humorous script, and director John Wells' (August: Osage County) genuine kitchen scenes."
rotten,At the end the experience is insipid. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,It's interestin that the main character is so unlikable yet so interesting. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"It's a shame we got served such a visually stunning dish, but cold. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The film is so conserned with the main characters past that one wonders why writer Steven Knight didn't chose to tell the story of his descent into darkness instead of what we see on screen. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"The film is not a masterpiece, but it is not a mess to endure either. Is entertaining and enjoying. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The cast really tries to make it work, however, as the movie goes on the premise turns boring and we get a cold and flavorless dish. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"This is a film with all the right ingredients, but in the end, it's a flavorless dish. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If it wasn't for the great cast, this film would've been better profiled for direct to video and DVD. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,An entertaining film but not much else. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"Great entertainment, fun, fast and maybe a little predictable. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"While the chef's rock-star persona ... does seem excessive, an excellent script and an immersive performance by Cooper result in an interesting character study."
rotten,"Undermined by predictability, culinary drama, Burnt is surprisingly bland and unexcitingly seasoned for a kitchen-based flick that sees Bradley Cooper step into the role of a bad-boy chef on the road to redemption."
rotten,"The only one of any interest is chef Helene (Sienna Miller), a single mother trying to make it in a professional kitchen... You can't help but feel that hers would have been a more interesting story to tell."
fresh,"Undoubtedly though, this is a film that will work best for those who can't get enough of the food channel as its most authentic and gripping sequences do actually involve the preparation of the various gourmet dishes."
fresh,"Bradley Cooper turns in a compelling, slow-burn performance as an arrogant chef aiming for his third Michelin star in Burnt."
fresh,You might just feel like treating yourself to a delicious meal after watching this.
rotten,"Despite the amount of delectably photographed dishes, the drama in Burnt unfortunately feels undercooked and watered down."
rotten,Bradley Cooper is a chef looking for redemption in this little successful dramedy. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"What is most noticeable in this film is that in the 100 minutes, there is nothing that appeals to the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"A light, entertaining and well told film you can enjoy without any complications, especially for those who enjoy great food. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Half-baked, tepid, underseasoned - all these culinary put-downs are deserved for a film that asks us to root for a broken man with nothing to lose, then hands him redemption on a silver platter."
rotten,"Cooper's performance helps lift the character but as is often the case with a mediocre script and story, it's not clear what exactly this movie wants to be. You'll enjoy the great-looking movie star. The comeback story? Not so much."
fresh,"Built around a strong performance by Cooper, ""Burnt"" is a story of redemption."
fresh,. . . This story of how a troubled exile achieves healing through a creative partnership with a woman equally devoted to their shared craft is familiar ground . . . Burnt could be re-titled Silver Linings Cookbook.
fresh,"Strong characters help hold the attention as this overcooked drama develops, but in the end it feels so concocted that it's difficult to believe."
rotten,Burnt is plated beautifully but lacks the complexity of flavor it so desperately wants to achieve.
rotten,...a missed opportunity that ultimately feels like two movies ungainly stitched together at the middle (ie it's both an engrossing cooking drama and all-too-slick character study).
fresh,"It makes for a pretty good show. Cooper cooks up sweet and juicy in just about every role he plays, so watching the him sizzle on the griddle of short-order Shakespeare set against the backdrop of Europe's fine cuisine is a ready pleasure."
fresh,"Cooper delivers the goods right enough, with help from Daniel Bruhl as his business partner and Sienna Miller as his sous-chef-cum-love-interest."
rotten,This half-baked dramedy about cooking feels more like a lackluster television pilot rather than a feature-length film.
rotten,It's intended to be a tale of redemption but Adam doesn't have a lot of redeeming qualities.
rotten,Anyone who makes an informed decision to watch Burnt might want to bring a bingo-card of dramatic cliches to tick off during the run-time.
rotten,"It is hard to find the characters' preoccupations anything other than ridiculous, however divine the food looks."
rotten,"Burnt should have been a spicy treat. Instead, it comes and goes like so much fast food, leaving you hungry for a late-night DVD snack ..."
rotten,This drama about a world-renowned chef seeking redemption in his personal life features a fiery performance by Bradley Cooper compromised by a predictable script that doesn't have the right mix of ingredients.
fresh,"Director John Wells deftly navigates the trajectory of the story, helped by Rob Simonsen's frothy score."
rotten,"Burnt wants to be viewed as a post-modern, emotionally hardcore odyssey; a foodie version of Birdman. At once too earnest and too glossily daft to measure up, it's actually closer in mood to an Eighties Agatha Christie TV special."
rotten,Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller dish up a thin stew of streaky ham and overcooked corn in this horribly predictable drama about a fiery-tempered chef's attempts to earn a third Michelin star.
rotten,"Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, reunited on screen after last year's American Sniper, give committed and likeable performances but battle against the sheer contrivances and strange mix of ingredients in an over-egged screenplay."
rotten,Burnt is strictly a la carte.
rotten,"There's lots of food porn, but the overall sensation is one of emptiness."
rotten,"With a title that already reeks of failure, Bradley Cooper's turn in Burnt as a Michelin-starred chef making a comeback from coke-induced burnout is best avoided."
rotten,"Glossy, hollow disaster."
rotten,"As for Burnt itself, it is somewhat redeemed - rescued, really - by the shiny distraction of Bradley Cooper's explosive star power. The movie is a mess, narratively, with an undercooked (sorry, couldn't help myself) conflict and a stumbling plot."
rotten,There's so many overdone tropes in Burnt that it's reminiscent of a tired out family recipe
rotten,"Undemanding, unashamed garbage, which we can't help but indulge in from time to time."
fresh,"... Director John Wells ... effectively captures the controlled chaos of the kitchen, and Adam's personal growth is as satisfying as it is predictable."
fresh,"Smart, funny, emotionally affecting -- if maybe a little overstuffed -- film anchored to interesting characters is much better than you've perhaps been led to believe."
rotten,Gluttons for footage of Bradley Cooper and meticulously plated white-tablecloth dinner entres may be the only consumers able to stomach this foodie road-to-redemption drama.
rotten,A celebration of male obnoxiousness that goes warm and fuzzy over its temperamental manchild as he finally learns to impersonate a decent human being. What?
fresh,"For all practical purposes, it's Steve Jobs with aprons."
rotten,"Of all the movies in which cooking is a metaphor for love or a vehicle for redemption, Burnt may be the first in which the carefully presented, fastidiously styled chow looks like nothing you actually want to eat."
rotten,"Never comes to life, with each two-dimensional character mouthing platitudes designed to tell you what to think about them."
rotten,"An unusually pitched portrait of a culinary genius from the Gordon Ramsay school of shouty chefs who needs to learn to, like, chill out. But that high energy never fully translates to the screen."
rotten,"Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller burned up ""American Sniper"" but not this movie."
rotten,Bradley Cooper is not believable as a Michelin starred chef in 'Burnt'. Send this dish back to the kitchen.
rotten,"While Burnt tries to offer a higher-profile, Weinstein-backed exploration of such an innately cinematic subject, its tepid drama and low stakes won't make you stay for dessert."
rotten,"""Burnt"" can't spice up familiar recipe."
rotten,"Lucious food porn and a few solid performances aside, it feels like a redemption narrative that's mostly half-bak-...nope, not gonna do it."
fresh,This foodie melodrama has its pleasures in a story of a brilliant chef seeking redemption after being felled by fame's side dishes -- hubris and excess.
fresh,"Fans of ""Top Chef"" or reruns of Julia Child's ""French Chef"" will be drawn to ""Burnt"""
fresh,"Burnt is an enjoyable entry in this subgenre, anchored by a rangy Bradley Cooper performance and marbled with food."
fresh,Salty portrait of chef's comeback serves up fine acting.
fresh,Cooking movies always inspire me to want to cook. This one didn't. It's not bad but it's not up to my cooking movie standards. Promises steak and delivers a burger.
rotten,Burnt can only tell us that Adam is a terrible person so many times before we start to believe it.
fresh,"The redemptive journey ""Burnt"" takes us on has momentary bursts of flavor, but it never makes for the truly satisfying meal."
fresh,"The previews for this film make it look as bland & tasteless as some mediocre meal. Thankfully, it's a bit tastier than that, although it's still about as formulaic as they come. (Full Content Review - Sex, Violence, Profanity, etc. - also available)"
rotten,"A macho foodie fantasy with Cooper as a swaggering sex god in an apron. If this were a comedy, it would be brilliant."
rotten,"Lots of quick cuts and kitchen close-ups - of gas stoves, buttery saucepans and stock characters concentrating preciously on haute cuisine - and lots of unmoving melodrama."
fresh,"The food looks great, the cast looks great, the dialogue is reasonably snappy, and the movie is happily shameless ..."
rotten,The story is pitted with the type of holes that suggest the film went into production with an uncorrected first draft.
fresh,"The actors are all better than you'd expect in a film of such dim ambition, but there's a curious lack of the actual scrumptious grub."
rotten,It is often fatal to a movie to have its characters more in thrall to the lead than the audience is.
rotten,"Bound to inspire headlines full of tiresome kitchen wordplay: ""half-baked,"" ""underdone,"" ""lacks seasoning."" What it really is, though, is late for dinner."
fresh,Its best scene by far is its most uncomfortable: Jones throwing a Gordon Ramsay-worthy tanty and demanding that Helene apologise to a fish she has cooked badly.
rotten,The film hums along pleasantly without really engaging you beyond the surface level pleasures of watching attractive people make high-class cuisine.
rotten,"Unless you also want a tremendous side of ego and hearty helping of yelling, Burnt may be a dish to skip."
rotten,"""Burnt"" is overcooked. If that sounds like a glib way to describe an entertainment about the comeback of a celebrity chef, it's also perfectly suited to a movie that wears its glossiness as a badge of honor."
fresh,"Cooper does a great job in the role of a cocky American chef, and his character's emotional arc is pretty engaging. However, the rest of the story and characters aren't given nearly as much attention."
rotten,"Burnt could have blazed a trail for more complicated movies about chefs, but it's too flawed in its execution and presentation."
rotten,"""Burnt"" gets distracted by petty dramas. Without enough meat on the bones of this story, it's just not as satisfying as it could be, evaporating quickly into thin air."
rotten,"There are too many fumbles, too many missteps, and the most interesting bits of the film are swept off the cutting board and into the trash."
rotten,"Burnt can't top off its plate with engaging characters or an exciting story. This confection fades almost immediately after it's over, leaving only a slight tingle on the tongue."
rotten,The real issue is that everything about Adam's journey feels half digested and tossed back up. We've seen it before. It was better the first time.
rotten,"This should be a better movie than it is. As it stands, though, it's merely - sorry - unappetizing."
rotten,"The filmmakers ... have a wrongheaded expectation that we'll be endlessly fascinated by this abusive jerk's china-trashing Gordon Ramsay tirades and eventual, too-easy mea culpa. Sorry, not to our taste."
rotten,"A soggy, ultimately unpalatable experience...overly familiar and curiously bland."
fresh,"If the last-act redemption is a little predictable, getting there makes for engrossing viewing -- food fights, violence and all."
rotten,"For a movie about a chef who just will not shut up about how great everything needs to be, he sure is stuck in a movie that otherwise screams milquetoast, in both ideas and execution."
rotten,"You could leave halfway through the story and get an early dinner and, save for the details, you'd pretty much know how it all works out with the movie."
rotten,"The hero spends an inordinate amount of time screaming at his kitchen staff and hurling plates of food at the wall, which is more fun to watch than the canned relationships that constitute most of the movie."
fresh,"It's not pretty, but it captures something that few cooking movies do: reality."
rotten,"There's never any doubt that redemption is the end-game for Jones, but the claim for his saving is weak sauce; the case against him has been too emphatically, if unintentionally, argued."
rotten,Is it too much to ask for a film about creative self-destruction to have a few loose screws of its own?
rotten,"Mr. Morgan Freeman performing a role we've already seen him play, in a story we already know, three screenwriters with very little aim... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"What sort of nutty compromises were reached to get financing here, there and everywhere, and round up this cast?"
fresh,"In them, the film goes somewhere beyond the police procedural pale and stands out in a sea of serial killer films."
rotten,The Ritual Killer carves hapless innocents in a disjointed narrative with poorly connected subplots. Former NFL star Vernon Davis is the only high point as a scarred and merciless villain.
rotten,"Muddled, vaguely irritating, and somewhat offensive, this un-thrilling thriller moves lifelessly through through its story and has a bizarre head-scratcher of an ending."
rotten,Mediocre thriller.
rotten,The suspense dwindles as the contrivances mount in this laughably incoherent thriller.
rotten,"The Ritual Killer is offensive as a piece of storytelling. As an attempt at filmmaking, it's on that same level."
rotten,"The Ritual Killer starts offensively bad but somehow continues to dig a bigger hole from there until its asinine, idiotic ending"
rotten,"For a movie about a murderer, black magic, and traumatic pasts, nobody here is working up the energy to care much about it."
rotten,The Last Sentinel squanders its gripping storytelling for a spineless finale.
fresh,"The simple premise is elevated by strong filmmaking and an engaging cast, while an understated, often enigmatic storytelling approach keeps us intrigued even if concrete details are naggingly elusive."
rotten,"In a world filled with a never-ending stream of films and TV shows, you should do yourself a favour and decide to watch something (anything) other than Last Sentinel."
rotten,Last Sentinel is a dreary slog of a movie about four quarreling military people stranded on an outpost in the ocean. This lackluster drama has a thin plot that gets dragged out and tangled up in a lot of nonsense.
fresh,"Small in budget but large in ambition, this futuristic, single-space thriller has a few bugs, but it also has interesting characters, a few intriguing twists, and a great setting."
rotten,The cast manages to elevate a weak end of times script.
fresh,Exasperating and bleak science fiction futuristic thriller.
rotten,"It’s a melancholy, meditative work more interested in its situation’s ability to extract philosophical dialogue from its characters than its ability to force them into dramatically meaningful decisions."
rotten,“Last Sentinel” is as bleak and dreary as its setting.
rotten,“Last Sentinel” is more geared toward delivering a message about humanity’s bent toward paranoia and self-destruction than in producing any tension or thrills. It’s a very heavy film — really too heavy to move.
fresh,"If just one of the actors in Last Sentinel had given a lackluster performance, the film would have collapsed in on itself. But everyone kicks in a captivating performance that only heightens the tension."
fresh,"Whereas you might assume this low budget Estonian production would devolve into an ""us versus them"" mentality ripe for fireworks, the script refuses to deviate from its anti-war wake-up call approach."
rotten,[The] movie ... seems far more interested in establishing background than in determining a course to follow in the foreground.
rotten,"Last Sentinel attempts thoughtful discourse on climate change, humanity's destructive nature, and paranoid xenophobia in a desolate setting. The mystery that drives the narrative lingers for too long into a banal finale."
rotten,An intriguing if not fully realized sci-fi drama starring Kate Bosworth in a future in which most of the world is underwater and the crew of a lonely outpost questions their fate.
rotten,Tanel Toom is impressive regarding the film’s craftsmanship; one wishes deeper characters were here to bolster the narrative’s timely themes
rotten,Shows no interest in screen movement despite taking on a plot that has the potential for a more active sense of danger.
fresh,Tanel Toom brings the right amount of solemnity to this surprisingly engrossing sci-fi chamber piece.
fresh,One of the coolest Action Thrillers in along time. Ben Affleck proves his strengths as a leading actor
fresh,"“The Accountant” does plenty right – a good cast with good performances, bursts of intense well-shot action (occasionally laced with bits of dry humor), a dense but thoughtful story."
fresh,"Many delectable connections and catalysts are deftly hidden in subtle imagery, passing clues, and little character quirks throughout the film.  Some of the bigger twists are visible solar systems away while others spark and combust in clever reveals."
rotten,"Although it's tempting to forgive the film's structural zig-zagging, the ludicrously convenient twists and questions spoil its overall effect."
fresh,"Smart movies offer intriguing setups, unique characters and tantalizing plot pirouettes. The Accountant is a smart movie. Smart movies also avoid offering imbecilic narrative coincidences and imploding third acts. Alas, The Accountant isn't THAT smart."
fresh,"Despite some serious narrative flaws, The Accountant and its autistic action hero offer an adventure that holds your attention and keeps excitement high."
rotten,The climax devolves tremendously - not just quickly but also extremely bumpily - to the point that the intriguing setup will surely be forgotten.
fresh,"Like the protagonist with a puzzle, every piece fits neatly in place, every question has a concrete answer, and a convenient flashlight shines into every shadowy corner."
rotten,It's five different kitschy movies in one.
rotten,This movie was like Jason Bourne: The CPA.
fresh,The Accountant works because it treats its subject and characters seriously without taking itself too seriously.
rotten,"[A]n overlong, meandering, and downright ridiculous mess."
fresh,"The film has a good balance between perceptive characterization, solid storytelling, and excellent action. Come for the sensitive and progressive portrayal of autism, stay for Ben Affleck smoking some fools."
fresh,"If it were a bunch of newbies in the main roles, The Accountant would not have worked, because when things get really really weird at the end, I only rolled with it because it was clear these actors and actresses were also having much fun..."
fresh,Gavin O'Connor managed to take this crazy notion and a somewhat hackneyed script and make it into a solid action movie with a warming message.
fresh,"Stay with it, give into it, and you'll find the numbers add up and it will reward you in the end."
fresh,"The movie is a complete story, which is great. There's the possibility for a sequel, but not the necessity. The story is complete in itself."
fresh,"The Accountant cooks the books to perfection, serving up a nourishing feast of R-rated action, refreshingly engaging characters and a script that kept me guessing - liberally peppered with some delectably spicy left-field laughs."
rotten,"The film manages to torpedo the autistic community in stultifying fashion, envisioning itself as woke pop culture escapism when it really traffics in the same insulting stereotypical sticks and stones that have long been thrown."
fresh,"It does give the audience a pretty good action thrill ride, as long as you do not look too deep into its inner workings."
rotten,The movie could have been a lot more entertaining had the filmmakers focused on fewer threads and settled on a more consistent tone.
fresh,This film is a cut above; all the pieces add together and the result is greater than the sum of its individually high-value parts.
fresh,"Despite the strained premise and the narrative inconsistency, there's something oddly enjoyable about the film."
rotten,Full of jarring tone shifts and subplots that bury the film's initial promise.
rotten,"The intrigue is thrown out the window for a ""guy keeps the girl safe"" plotline that belongs in a 1995 Jean Claude Van Damme movie."
fresh,I am amazed at how Ben Affleck was able to portray his character while still keeping in mind the characteristics of someone living with Asperger's Syndrome.
rotten,I can honestly barely be bothered to remember what the point of the present-day part of the story even was.
rotten,"The question left is whether or not genre films can handle the topic of autism in manner that doesn't come across as crassly exploitative. At present, I'm inclined to say no."
rotten,"If Batman, Daredevil and Jason Bourne had a baby who loved calculus, you'd have The Accountant. Think of this one as more of a write-off."
rotten,"This indication that the filmmakers don't know the difference between realism and boredom doesn't inspire confidence. The movie gets more interesting from there, but it never gets more credible."
rotten,"""The Accountant"" just becomes a dull shoot 'em up movie, complete with acrobatic stunts and guys dressed in black hiding behind things."
fresh,"It's a film that, if you look at it too closely, has holes, but with a proper buildup to its finale, ""The Accountant"" is easily one of the year's most memorable and entertaining films."
fresh,"Affleck perfectly walks the line between deadly and endearing, and I'd love to see more of this character in a sequel."
fresh,"The Accountant is a movie I struggle with. I enjoyed it, but I can clearly see its faults. Its failures make its successes less impactful."
rotten,"The Accountant wants to have it all - to be a thriller, a romance, an action movie, a twisty crime drama - only to end up unconvincing on all counts."
fresh,"It has its pleasures, but they are guilty, indeed."
rotten,"The hero is autistic, a wizard at math, an expert at martial arts and an ultra-skilled sniper who is leading a double life. But all this is not enough to make The Accountant a film worth seeing."
rotten,"The question ""Do you like puzzles""often get asked a lot in The Accountant... well this movie is one overly elaborate puzzle where none of the pieces fit together."
rotten,The Accountant is messier than its multitude of gunshot wounds to the head.
rotten,Descends to the level of a Marvel comic.
fresh,"Like WoIff, if you as intrigued by incongruity and inconsistencies in people's behaviour, you will love this wonderfully made thriller, that unfolds like an enchanting fictional puzzle."
fresh,The Accountant is an out-and -out action film and action film buffs won't be disappointed by the use of heavy duty guns and armour piercing bullets which turn the climax into a veritable battlefield.
fresh,"Starring Ben Affleck and Anna Kendrick, it was always going to be watchable, but I can promise you that as you settle down to it, nothing can prepare you for the journey on which you are about to embark."
rotten,"Math-Man Begins includes an ACCOUNTING MONTAGE and gets progressively stupider as it goes along, which means by the end you're pressed to hold back howling laughter."
fresh,"Affleck is suitably awkward as Wolff, bringing a hint of innocence to the character's danger."
fresh,"It's a clever film in that it twists and turns in relatively new ways, but it may be a turn too many for some."
rotten,"Whatever numbers game The Accountant is playing, it doesn't add up."
rotten,"If it's free and you're hungover on a Sunday morning someday when this is streaming, go for it. But otherwise, save your Fandango dollars for a movie that makes more sense."
rotten,"The Accountant is one of those movies in which a lot seems to be going on, but not much actually happens, aside from some bombastic action sequences designed to show us how amazing Affleck is."
rotten,It leaves so many plot holes and loose ends flailing about I wonder if the hope is to turn this into a franchise? It definitely seems to set itself up for a sequel no one will want to see.
fresh,"The Accountant is, like The Girl on the Train, not a great film, but totally worth seeing."
rotten,"All the origin-story stuff, mysterious machinations, and even action-scenes come off as calculated contrivances in the end."
fresh,This bonkers but brilliant premise means this is one of the more preposterous action movies of the year. It's also one of the most entertaining.
rotten,Chunks of the narrative seem to have disappeared; in their place are rhetorical questions meant to bridge the gaps.
fresh,"At best, The Accountant may be worth checking out for its very personable ensemble. Led by the deceptively mild-mannered Ben Affleck, they elevate the film above the standard B-movie entertainment."
rotten,"Director Gavin O'Connor has made some tough, decent dramas about the frayed bonds of family and subcultures, but it takes ludicrous steps to get The Accountant down to that fundamental level, and once there the film barely registers."
fresh,"While at 128 minutes, we cannot credit The Accountant with being efficient, it clips along at a good pace and true."
fresh,"With strong symbolism and character credibility, it is easy to overlook the mishaps and to overall enjoy The Accountant."
fresh,"One or two elements fall short and a few reveals may seem obvious, but (this) is something of a surprise in a box office overstuffed with animated family flicks and superhero hijinks."
fresh,"Throughout, Affleck is a capable, enjoyable leading man."
rotten,"Eschews any semblance of exploring an antisocial man in a heightened situation in favour of a stock-standard, twist-oriented action-thriller."
fresh,"Smartly directed, with a nice twist in the story, ""The Accountant"" rests squarely on the shoulders of Ben Affleck."
rotten,"Affleck's dead-eyed performance is weirdly inert and awkward, and he looks uncomfortable, like he's trying not to laugh, or holding in a fart on a hot date."
fresh,"A very entertaining movie, which you will enjoy in a rainy afternoon. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"A film that can be entertaining, mainly because Gavin O'Connor already had demonstrated that he can make good movies with ridiculous premises and here confirms that ability. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Just once it would be refreshing if a movie about a genius treated the audience as if they had half of the protagonist's brainpower.
rotten,"Unfortunately this one runs out of steam and becomes more of a shoot now, ask questions later (or never) flick."
fresh,We commend the lens work of Ulsterman Seamus McGarvey while the inventive flourishes in Bill Dubuque's script drag it away from schlocky crime-novel tendencies.
fresh,"Ben Affleck [is] an autistic savant who's a whiz at maths and a dab hand at killing people, too... as plots go, none of this exactly stands up to forensic scrutiny, but the film's manifest flaws don't detract from its incidental pleasures."
fresh,"A pleasant surprise within the genre. With unexpected twists, a good mix of suspense and construction of characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"By over-complicating, while simultaneously dumbing down, the story and by adding too many extraneous characters, The Accountant underserves a decent sounding premise."
fresh,A movie that wants to take itself too seriously or wants to look smarter than it actually is but it never bored me and kept my attention all the time. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,A film that has a committed great cast that makes the absurd points of the movie be passed without major complaints. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Unlike its lead character, The Accountant can't get all its numbers in a row."
fresh,"At least, in its determinedly populist way, this violent character study makes you think."
fresh,"Ben Affleck gets to play Will Hunting and Jason Bourne in this superhero origin story for adults ... Besides the incredible skills, we get a secret lair, double identities, even a shot of identical suits lined up in a closet like Batsuits."
rotten,"This ill-computed action thriller is daft, laboured and over-complicated, containing as much back story as it does present day plot."
fresh,Deeply silly but undeniably entertaining.
rotten,"The Accountant fails to fully develop any of its ideas, ultimately delivering a series of half-baked concepts."
fresh,Hopefully the inevitable sequel will plug some of the plot holes.
fresh,"Scores big for daring to be a little different, but is ultimately undermined by being just that little bit too contrived."
rotten,I like being challenged as a filmgoer but there's too much going on here.
rotten,'The Accountant' doesn't quite add up.
fresh,"No, the ending of The Accountant doesn't quite add up. But as a puzzler-thriller with pretensions to smartness, it still does the business, just."
rotten,The dubious composition of Affleck's character leaves a foul taste in the mouth.
rotten,"While this slick dramatic thriller plays with some intriguing ideas and themes, it never actually breaks the surface, relying on silly plotting and simplistic moralising."
fresh,"So convoluted, confusing, and overly crammed that it's overwhelming, and not in a pleasant way. But Ben Affleck's autistic action hero is fascinating."
rotten,"In The Accountant, blatancy overtakes sincerity...absurdly convoluted, this film stays blatantly politically correct."
fresh,"Completely bizarre, but all the better for it."
fresh,You'll enjoy it - count on it.
fresh,"Rain Man meets Batman in The Accountant, an enjoyably silly action movie starring Ben Affleck as an on-the-spectrum forensic accountant who doubles up as a secret vigilante."
rotten,"Ben Affleck will have relished the idea of subverting the image of the mild-mannered pen-pusher, but this drama from Jane Got a Gun director Gavin O'Connor ties him up in knots with twists and turns that all add up to zero."
rotten,"Is two hours of this hokum a worthwhile investment of your time, not to mention the cash-flow implications? On balance, probably not."
fresh,The Accountant isn't unenjoyable but you don't believe a word of it.
fresh,"A fantastically convoluted, over-extended but watchable action thriller whose many dangling loose ends, subplots and side characters are finally tied up with a showy flourish."
rotten,This improbable thriller starts out strong but quickly becomes bogged down in unnecessary plot twists.
rotten,"Some films are so ridiculous that they entertain in spite of their stupidity. Ben Affleck's The Accountant is a classic case in point; a supposedly serious, even muscular thriller, boosted by an A-list cast that quite simply doesn't add up."
fresh,"You could forgive The Accountant most of its foibles if it didn't hinge on a late twist which can only be described as preposterous, and which fatally deflates the drama at a critical moment."
rotten,"The Accountant boasts an appealing central performance from the redoubtable Ben Affleck, but is elsewhere lumbered with sluggish pacing, a surfeit of narrative detail, implausible coincidences, [and] tension-deflating flashbacks."
rotten,"Neither conventionally well-made nor avant-garde enough, The Accountant is caught in a limbo where it lacks the appeal to satisfy either general or niche audiences."
fresh,"Violent fun, punctuated by laugh out loud moments and unexpectedly strong drama."
rotten,The one equation it never manages to balance is the one that says making a film about Asperger's Syndrome being more or less a superpower equals a rip-roaring and completely non-problematic jape.
rotten,This cast deserves better than a faux-'70s action thriller. Tedious and forgettable.
fresh,"...there's something undeniably appealing and entertaining about this wholly ridiculous meld of bone-crunching action, off-the-wall characterisation, and hard won sentiment."
rotten,"Sadly, Kendrick has little to do in the film's second half, which gets bogged down in a pointlessly complicated plot, much of it relayed in an especially clumsy flashback just before the climax."
rotten,"The result is a film that, in spite of its title, simply doesn't add up properly."
fresh,"This is a well-acted, written and directed film (directed by Gavin O'Connor of 'Warrior') with lots of action and a bit of humor too. Writer Bill Dubuque ('The Judge') does a nice job of developing all these characters."
rotten,"As an action thriller, the Accountant does little more than balance its books."
fresh,"The Accountant is one of those rare, guilty-pleasure exercises in empty escapism that effortlessly gets on your good side and remains there."
fresh,"The casting of Ben Affleck as a genius maths-assassin may not add up, but The Accountant proves he can carry films as if they were remainders."
rotten,"Perhaps its worst violation, in a deluge of cinematic crimes, is the so-called twist, obvious about an hour before it's finally confirmed with an exasperated ""ugh, finally, is it over yet?"""
fresh,"A drama and thriller with action, suspense and a message, where Ben Affleck plays a man with autism. This film can be a breath of fresh air for the genre. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,A very odd film that unfortunately results quite closer to ridicule than geniality. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Any such understatement the character has is not in any way indicative of the film, which is far too unsubtle in its execution."
fresh,"""The American ""R"" rating is earned gleefully. If someone were to do the math on close-range headshots, this flick surely would go Top 5."" - [Reviewed by Lachlan Marks]"
rotten,"There are clever touches, effective moments and enjoyable performances but Gavin O'Connor's film never gels into a coherent or believable whole."
fresh,"Be prepared to be startled: this thumping thriller is full of dark themes, secrets and unexpected revelations"
fresh,"Stylish and slick in the best sense of both words, it makes us welcome the idea of a franchise. (One is clearly intended.) J.K. Simmons, Jon Bernthal, Jeffrey Tambor and John Lithgow highlight a strong supporting cast."
fresh,The Accountant is entertaining junk.
rotten,A strong first 2/3 devolves into a final third which is almost entirely retroactive exposition.
fresh,"It falters when it comes to action, especially during a climax that takes place in the middle of a storm, and where the violence becomes murky and hard to enjoy. “The Equalizer 2” never reaches the same level as its predecessor. Full review in Spanish."
fresh,"Denzel is always immensely watchable and the hurricane-set finale is packed with suspense, but overall the movie is dampened by an unfocused and predictable plot."
rotten,"Those random bits of setup that are thrown into the early parts of the film feel almost entirely gratuitous and do nothing but distract from what’s going on around them, but they actually get far more irritating once they start to pay off."
fresh,"Washington is such a joy to watch. The seasoned star hasn’t lost a bit of his allure, and his ability to carry a film is unmatched."
fresh,This twisty sequel takes the temperature and weight of the cold lead hammer that is Denzel and heats it with anger and stakes to match the hot lead being shot around him.
rotten,The Equalizer 2 leaves the viewer with a boredom hangover - a cloudy funk that lingers well after the credits roll.
fresh,"A step up from the original, raising the stakes and making an effort that's not just watchable, it's occasionally even enjoyable."
fresh,An enjoyable action-packed film with terrific pacing; the two-hour runtime flies right on by.
fresh,A solidly entertaining popcorn flick with pretensions of bringing Shakespearean level of pathos to the tale of vengeance.
rotten,The Equalizer 2 is another blockbuster to join all the other summer sequels in box office heaven.
rotten,The revelations are entirely predictable and the assemblage of villains serve only as fodder for ruthless slaughtering.
fresh,"I can't tell you to pay $12 dollars to see this movie, not with all the other goods currently in theaters."
fresh,A better film because Denzel's in it.
rotten,The Equalizer 2 lectures its audience about the importance of life itself -- and then pulls a gun on whatever importance might exist.
rotten,Fuqua and company trade in the vicious streak that made the first film so gleefully mean for ho-hum tedium.
fresh,"There are probably one or two too many subplots that don't really amount to much, but any excuse to see this actor try on different hats as the same character is pretty exciting. This is a mild recommendation."
rotten,Fuqua's direction is slick but generally uninspired.
fresh,This might not be a great piece of awards-bait filmmaking but it is a rather enjoyable movie.
fresh,"While not reinventing the wheel of modern-day action thrillers, if viewers liked the first film, this new outing may provide similar feelings once the end credits roll."
fresh,"And through it all, the noise and the quiet, [Denzel] Washington dominates, even surrounded by a group of terrific supporting players."
fresh,"Not bad, but why does Denzel make a transition in the first movie to this one from a once hardened military soldier into a disheveled dopey guy that likely doesn't know how to comb his hair? It just started to go in a weird direction."
rotten,"The Equalizer was a satisfying action yarn, but this sequel offers few similar pleasures."
fresh,A remarkable thriller that I've personally enjoyed more than its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"A film with characters that we care about, a spectacular, violent and intelligently action, and an impeccable Denzel Washington. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,Washington's first sequel is likely to be remembered for that trivia nugget and almost nothing else. It's the kind of movie so confused that Ta-Nehisi Coates' work is repeatedly name checked but the film also stops for a respectability politics lecture.
rotten,One can't help but feel that The Equaliser 2 could have exploited the taxi driver set-up in a more intense manner akin to Collateral.
rotten,"A sequel only in name and not by nature, The Equalizer 2 doesn't differentiate itself from any number of the countless male-driven action projects doing the rounds these days"
fresh,"Yes, the plot is very much B-movie fare, but the star brings his A-game."
rotten,There have been several Denzel Washington films over the years that were worthy of sequels and the seasoned actor surely considered the merits of each one. That's what makes his choice of the utterly disposable The Equalizer 2 such a mystery.
rotten,"If you're a fan of Washington as a general rule, you shouldn't be dissatisfied with his portrayal - instead, you can reserve your disappointment for the film's slow pacing and uninspired action beats."
fresh,"While the movie might not be great, it's extremely watchable thanks to the inescapable charismatic magnetism of its star."
fresh,If you're a fan of Denzel Washington then I think we can all agree that this movie is just padding his stats at this point.
rotten,"Between the moralizing life lessons that are spouted at full volume intensity, the film doesn't shy away from graphic, bloody violence."
rotten,The Equalizer 2 begins with a lot of momentum. It dissipates as attention shifts to Washington's former spy colleagues.
fresh,"[Denzel] Washington doesn't bring anything novel to his acting tool belt, yet it has enough focus to become a successful B-movie, even if it is weirdly preachy."
fresh,Equalizer 2 is cut from the same cloth as one and packs in quite a few punches. It's a delight for action seekers and diehard Washington fans - there's plenty of both to 'equalize' the obvious flaws.
rotten,A bad sequel to a mediocre previous installment. Who could've predicted this?
rotten,The Equalizer 2 ultimately joins other conveyor belt revenge fantasies haphazardly conceived in 2018...
fresh,A vengeful Denzel is a sight to behold and I root for this franchise's existence but it seems like it's too much to ask for the movies themselves to live up to the standard of their star.
rotten,"Fun in the moment, but forgettable after, Fuqua and Washington's sequel is a passable revenge thriller."
fresh,"Even with a relatively weak plot, Washington demonstrates flashes of bloody excitement as he dispatches armed goons in steady intervals...That said, my audience reacted even more during the dramatic moments, graced by his Final Form as Uncle Denzel."
fresh,"The Equalizer 2 creates a fantasy world in which issues are black and white, and one man can control the destiny of those around him by sheer force of will. It's a staple in Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington's collaborations"
rotten,"Fuqua's movie, unqualified to create anything other than superficial poignancy, is empty, tiresome and uninteresting..."
fresh,"Because it stars Washington and is directed by Antoine Fuqua, it's going to have much more competence and sheen than comparable genre fare."
rotten,"The blandness of ""Equalizer 2"" even extends to Washington himself. This is the closest he's come to sleepwalking through a role."
fresh,An entertaining sequel that packs more power with each punch.
rotten,"Sure, praise is granted for some well choreographed slayings, but considering the cost of a movie ticket today, you're better off staying home and waiting for this one on basic cable."
fresh,"Another nasty, bone dry revenge thriller in which the coming storm of Washington's wrath is literalised as an on screen weather event."
rotten,"Despite its glossy sheen, this is just run-of-the-mill pulp fiction."
fresh,Watch the film for its superbly executed action and for more of a story than the last one. And for the behemoth called Denzel Washington...
rotten,"It is blunt, humourless and brutal, and reminds of the no-nonsense action films of the 1970s and early 1980s."
fresh,"Features a dynamic action-man performance from Denzel Washington, in a bone-crunching action thriller that expertly weaves in fine dramatic messaging."
fresh,"Denzel is Denzel, and he's going to deliver every time."
rotten,"The early action scenes on their own have a classic, macho rhythm. But you can't just write a tough guy, you need to give him a place to go."
rotten,"A disjointed plot, cliched characters, casting that pretty much works as a spoiler, and the clunkiest of visual metaphors - it is a mess, and a dull one at that."
fresh,Washington is a pleasure to watch on the screen. The two-time Oscar winner is able to tap into his own surplus of moral righteousness even when the script is pulling the carpet out from under him.
fresh,I honestly felt like the first half of this was better than the first [movie].
fresh,Everything in the movie is ridiculous... I'm waiting for the third one and he's working for Domino's.
fresh,Equalizer 2 is more than a worthwhile proposal. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Dull, pretentious, and mostly disposable."
rotten,"The best moments of Equalizer 2 are wasted in a film that confuses personality with pretension, in a story too frivolous to deserve the talent that has set it. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It's often cheesy and it's not deep, despite repeated cameos for a copy of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time, but it is, appropriately enough, the equal of The Equalizer."
rotten,"The confused, meandering course makes this difficult to get behind, while its idea of a climax is a CGI hurricane."
rotten,Equalizer 2 is no improvement on the 2014 movie.
fresh,"In summary, it is a good product, which questions and interrogates while it houses a franchise that is somewhat uncomfortable to place in the contemporary mainstream panorama. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Fuqua delivers a very reserved product, without being risky both in the plot and in its development, and this ends up taking its toll. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Clunky, over-processed cement-mixer cinema, given some consistency by Washington's screen presence..."
fresh,There are things to enjoy.
rotten,"Fuqua and Washington manage to deliver a strong ending, but the energy wasted on the way makes for a baggy film."
fresh,"It has a one-of-a-kind star front and centre and in allowing him to do his thing, we get a sequel that's uncommonly worthwhile."
fresh,"... if anyone can make meaningless look meaningful, it's Denzel. That's a big energy."
fresh,"A thriller that is sustained by a renowned actor accompanied by a solid cast that, although lost among small stories, ultimately comes out ahead as the action tape he promised to be. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A bloated, confusing, and terribly bland thriller."
fresh,"It's ridiculous, of course. And it's violent. It's also impeccably executed (pun intended), powerfully acted and sincerely acknowledges the value of goodness, virtue and doing the right thing."
fresh,"A tense crowdpleaser, but no one is stretching here, including the viewer."
fresh,"This is far more rhythmically assured than the first one, and gains a feel for urban melancholy in the editing and score that nudges close to elegance at times."
rotten,"A film of such frustrating ineptitude it doesn't even deserve the ""Sequelizer"" pun some critics have been applying to it."
fresh,The Equalizer 2 is a guilty pleasure - a by-the-numbers sequel given extra impetus by the presence of one of Hollywood's finest leading men.
fresh,"It's purely designed to be a high-intensity, exploitative bloodbath, and it does that very well."
rotten,It's a struggle to work out the point of the film.
fresh,"It's the same action-and-avenging nonsense as before, but directed with fair zest by Antoine Fuqua."
fresh,Denzel Washington's in rattling form. But when is he ever not?
fresh,More of the same from this franchise please.
fresh,"A marked improvement over its predecessor, packing in a handful of moments of legitimately spine-straightening suspense and, thank goodness, a sense of purpose for its lead."
rotten,"After four films with Fuqua, it's time for [Washington] to find a collaborator interested in making something more challenging than these childish, retrograde, wish fulfillment fantasies."
fresh,It's about as enjoyable as the first...there are some really good sequences with terrific dialogue. Plotting is the biggest issue here.
rotten,"The character in question, The Equalizer, shares the peaceful job of taxi driver with that of the relentless avenger of injustice and innocent victims... a sign of the film's lack of narrative continuity. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Once it's over, you won't necessarily be itching for an Equalizer 3."
fresh,"What makes The Equalizer 2as engaging as it is, is that we care for these characters in a way that most action movies tend to ignore."
fresh,The most notable thing about Equalizer 2 is the stylistic force of its director in the execution of its action scenes that take us to the darkest corners of the protagonist's soul. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"The Equalizer (2014) was one of those films that almost everyone forgot after seeing it, but that so many people saw that a sequel was already justified. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,Equalizer 2 is much more than a showcase vehicle for Washington. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Fragmented with too many subplots and unnecessarily sadistic violence, it's a ponderously contrived, avenging hero melodrama..."
rotten,"The tired, slow-burn movie around [Washington] ... is almost as punishing to an audience as McCall is to his prey."
rotten,Having McCall take a part-time gig as a Lyft driver hardly qualifies as meaningful character development - it's hardly even a useful plot device.
rotten,"The Equalizer films don't exactly push him beyond his comfort zone. But they celebrate the icon that Denzel is. They play on his persona, they savour his looming presence, and they give him more to chew on than similar films would."
fresh,"A solid, value-driven action thriller...The magnificently tense finale, which takes place in an evacuated coastal town about to be torn apart by a hurricane has so many religious references it's hard to keep count."
rotten,The Equalizer 2 is only the second in a series that already feels as if it is riddled with sequel fatigue.
rotten,"Unless Fuqua settles the vibranium question and tones the violence down, I'd prefer they don't team up for a third one."
fresh,"Essentially, if your idea of a good night out is watching Denzel Washington hang tough and destroy deserving scumbags, there's something for you here."
rotten,"It's just very standard, very predictable, very much exactly the movie you think it's going to be: that is the whole of its appeal and also its most glaring limitation."
fresh,"It's worth checking out, although on cable."
rotten,It's not much of a movie - more a parade of rah-rah triumphs obscuring a batch of logical oddities - which makes Washington's committed performance stand out like the heavenly host in the night sky over Bethlehem.
rotten,"Washington's implacable charisma and Fuqua's robust command of pace and style are desperately needed because writer Robert Wenk is back too, and he's flat out of ideas."
fresh,"Equalizer 2 is an entertaining time at the movies, but if they had only insisted on closing the plot holes and making a vivid villain, it could have been an outright classic."
rotten,"McCall, for all his high-minded talk, seems to take a little too much sick glee in all the bloodletting he engages in."
rotten,"In the end, we have very good action sequences adorned with unnecessary well-intentioned speeches imposed upon them. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's something of a snoozer, featuring a low-energy performance by Denzel, who spends much of the film quietly observing and very little time delivering impassioned speeches or putting inferior people into their place."
fresh,A couple of hours of pseudo-thoughtful entertainment.
rotten,"It tries to be a thoughtful action thriller, but ultimately feels like a charade. It looks ponderous, but really there's nothing there."
fresh,"The pacing of the film may be brisk, and the action scenes energizing, but a close look at the fight choreography shows that it concise and calculating."
fresh,"McCall is tailor-made for Washington, who plays AARP cool, yet deadly, better than anyone."
fresh,"Washington's McCall is a compelling character, the kind you'd quite happily like to hang out with whether he's busting heads or painting walls."
rotten,"Equalizer 2 is a slow, ponderous affair that not even Denzel's considerable charisma can save."
fresh,"Despite the implausibility and the troubling violence that Fuqua always forces on his audience, it is an entertaining film."
fresh,"This sequel to The Equalizer, itself based on the 1980s TV series, is more of the same, with (too) familiar screenwriting, a compelling lead character, and inventive action scenes."
rotten,"Even with Washington at the top of his game, ""The Equalizer 2"" just doesn't deliver the thrills."
fresh,Denzel Washington may be over 60 but as his work in his first sequel ever here proves he is definitely not over the hill.
fresh,"We've already mentioned that ""Equalizer 2"" offers more of the same, with its main attraction still giving his all while looking as if every vigilante move comes so very, very easily. That likely will be good enough for loyal Denzel fans of all ages."
rotten,"How do the filmmakers settle on a narrative for an Equalizer film? The answer is they don't, cramming several plotlines into one jumbled film."
rotten,"To update the mummy for our superhero moment, the 2017 movie erases the ambiguity of its predecessors."
rotten,...a generic middle-of-the-road movie.
rotten,"Less a ""Dark Universe"" than a dimly lit actionized blockbuster."
rotten,"A plastic product made by mercenaries, pimps and profiteers rather than filmmakers who give a damn."
rotten,The Dark Universe and original monster squad deserve more than this underwhelming film.
rotten,Many of the fight sequences are so chaotic that they conceal the nature of the choreography.
rotten,"If you want Tom Cruise on autopilot, wait for the Top Gun sequel..."
rotten,Truly painful to watch.
rotten,There's no curse about this. It's one of the most uninspiring films of the year.
rotten,"For all of its large scale and bluster, The Mummy's biggest flaw is that it's not fun or exciting enough. It tries, all right, but something's just not there, that intangible something that sets this kind of movie apart from the pack."
rotten,"Mindless is one thing, but stupid and regressive are something else entirely."
rotten,"This movie was one hundred percent, pure, cold garbage."
rotten,This movie was charmless.
rotten,"It's the film that launches many others, and as a result, a lot is riding on its success, both financially and as a starting-off point. As a result, it feels like a movie made by committee."
fresh,The Mummy is a LOT of fun. This is due to the fact that it commits to a very specific tone right off the bat all the way through to the end.
rotten,"Did they make a film they can be proud of and that will stand the test of time? No, but they created value for their shareholders."
rotten,"And that, children, is why the new Mummy movie sucks."
fresh,podcast review
rotten,Absolute garbage from beginning to end.
rotten,"The Mummy is a big budget endeavor meant to bring Universal into the comic book era. All those multi-genre elements exist, but the joy of going to the movies, the wonder of being touched by human elements does not."
rotten,An unabashed pillaging of another culture for the reconstitution of purely exploitative claptrap.
rotten,"The Mummy is just dull, lifeless - devoid of human spark. There are no genuine conversations; there are no relationships that even halfway try to convince."
rotten,"Director Alex Kurtzman packs so many genres into his Mummy movie, it's hard to track all the themes running through this mash-up."
fresh,"The Mummy should haul in the crowds, if not the critical acclaim."
rotten,Every predictable layer found within the derivative bandages of The Mummy reveals the sarcophagi of a dull and crusty film. The performances are stale other than Tom Cruise who is excited about @#$! no one else can bother with.
fresh,"It is true that it has a strange beginning, that it takes time to clarify the tone and that it wants to be too many things at once, but that matters little if we are aware that it is a first chapter of something bigger. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Dark is definitely the descriptive term I would use for The Mummy, as it is much less fun and campy than the 1999 version."
rotten,"The Mummy wants to be a horror movie, an action movie, and kick off an entire universe at the time same - and accomplishes none of those things."
fresh,"As always, Cruise is right in the thick of the stunt action, throwing himself round all manner of exploding buildings and crashing vehicles."
fresh,This opening film is certainly fun enough to make the prospect of The Mummy's return or other stories a welcome one.
rotten,"The Mummy is your usual action(less) caper where everything, including the antagonist, revolves around the male lead. And it has a plot that is as loose as the sands of the desert where the film was shot."
rotten,"Unfortunately, the film fails to achieve the desired launching effect, instead feeling overstuffed and needlessly expository in a way that an oddly flat Cruise can't overcome."
rotten,"Despite some great action set pieces with Cruise, The Mummy still feels incomplete. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's 9 am, on Wednesday June 7th, and I'm calling it on the Dark Universe, dear readers."
rotten,"All in all, there just isn't much here to like, and it's a shame. The title would have been better suited to be ""Tom Cruise: The Iraqi Plunderer""."
fresh,They definitely paid homage to the original franchise while taking this new series in a more interesting monster direction.
rotten,About 99% of Cruise's role consists of making confused and exasperated faces in inappropriate close-ups that only highlight how hilariously bad his default Mr. Intensity delivery is for a performance that's all mugging and spit-takes.
rotten,"A mixed bag of action, adventure, horror and comedy that feels like some of the money used on special effects should have been spent on a better screenplay."
rotten,"In trying so hard to lay pipe for interconnected franchises yet to come, the studio and filmmakers forgot to make the Dark Universe's debut compelling in its own right."
rotten,"If Marvel established the textbook way of how to start a cinematic universe, The Mummy should serve as the example of how not to."
rotten,A fairly generic action flick that features horror elements but fails to bring to the screen a distinct personality that will possibly coalesce into a coherent universe of monsters.
rotten,"The Mummy is a terrible movie in a multitude of ways, including dated views on women and people of color."
rotten,"Not completely horrific, although if I keep peeling back the layers, it might disappoint me more and more."
rotten,"I left not necessarily thinking this was a good movie, but still caring about the characters going forward..."
rotten,"Who doesn't want to watch another redundantly bland, would-be hero made from an irredeemable man who inexplicably is redeemed?"
rotten,A poor start of a universe which idea is better off in a tomb.
rotten,"The Mummy is a lost opportunity, introducing an incredible subtext that the movie fails to bring to its logical conclusion: that Tom Cruise, perhaps even more than ""Axel F,"" may be the root of all evil."
fresh,"The Mummy keeps things moving, and there's scarcely a frame that's not an imaginative eyeful. It's moderately entertaining, but it's never engrossing."
rotten,"Bogged down by unimaginative CGI-laden set-pieces, and lacking any character arcs, it's a limp attempt at capturing the summer-movie market overflowing with contenders..."
rotten,The film can't decide what it wants to be other than a Tom Cruise vehicle.
rotten,"Overall, ""The Mummy"" feels empty, devoid of any real urgency, intensity, and lacking in any likable characters."
rotten,"I am not even gonna bore you with all that is wrong in terms of directing, editing, lighting, or casting because all those could have been forgiven if the movie bothered to be a movie. This is one massive product placement."
rotten,"The Mummy feels inconsequential. While you're enjoying the ride, it never feels as though it's going anywhere."
rotten,This is supposed to be the start of a new universe...I don't know what you're supposed to do after this.
rotten,The Mummy buries the clear moral themes that make superhero movies so popular. Making light of darkness may curse this franchise.
rotten,"Universal's reboot of The Mummy franchise tries to be a lot of things at the same time, without excelling at any of them."
rotten,"As a Mummy movie, it kinds of fails. They use world-building exposition to build the cinematic universe that they're going for, but in doing so, they sacrifice a cohesive plot."
rotten,"The topper for me is the ending, however, which blatantly states everyone's intentions to make a sequel, and more. Really? I, for one, have already had enough."
rotten,"Bad news: The Mummy has risen from the tomb, and it stinks!"
rotten,People 13 and older are more likely to be offended by the fact they spent $15 on a ticket.
rotten,"Buckle your seat-belts, because this looks like only the first of many more monstrous turds flung our way."
rotten,"Even as a popcorn film, The Mummy is rather dull and a tonal mess, shifting from buddy comedy to CGI-actioner to chick-rescue flick to the rare but still very real Tom Cruise bomb."
rotten,"There's a lot of fun action and jump scares in this new Mummy, but not enough substance to make a lasting impression."
rotten,"""Where's your sense of adventure,"" asks military soldier/treasure hunter Nick (played by Tom Cruise with his usual charisma and flair for dangerous stunt work) to his partner. It's the same question I pose to The Mummy reboot"
rotten,"This incarnation of the wrapped figure is a dusty combination of Fatal Attraction and Mission: Impossible, making for one of the year's worst films."
rotten,"The filmmakers take the sexist adage, ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,"" to heart."
fresh,"The Mummy films starring Brendan Fraser were campy fun. Here, it's another ball game altogether."
rotten,The first entry in Universal Pictures' monster franchise comes across as a desperate attempt by the studio to capitalise on Hollywood's current world-building frenzy.
rotten,"This is meant to be a caper in the style, one imagines, of Indiana Jones, but it barely raises a laugh. Cruise may be many things but Harrison Ford he ain't. Or Michael Douglas, come to that."
fresh,The Mummy labors under its formula but there is some genuinely fun stuff in it.
rotten,The gaps in logic are more like crevasses and they occur right up to the credits.
fresh,The Mummy is truly a brilliant popcorn blockbuster that is fun and heartfelt and thrilling...
rotten,It has the definite stink of a filmmaking-by-committee project even without the franchise-building.
rotten,Let the dead continue to slumber. Please.
rotten,Tom Cruise's steadiness powers a lot of his late-period action movies. In The Mummy it starts to feel like a constraint.
rotten,"There are some good spooky bits early on, but when the movie stops making sense, you'll stop paying attention."
fresh,"Directed by Alex Kurtzman, this ""Mummy"" goes darker than the 1999 movie starring Brendan Fraser ... without crossing over into full-on horror."
rotten,It feels less like a movie than a series of compromises worked out by a corporate committee.
rotten,The sound and visual effects artists have also earned their salaries by creating a creepy Mummy with a distinctive voice. The screenplay isn't as strong.
fresh,"The Mummy begins with one main premise: Tom Cruise still has it. It ends with a promise: Tom Cruise will always have it. Assuming you're on board with those statements, you'll have a blast."
rotten,"Diverting by only the lowest of standards, this film is saved from one-star indignity by mere virtue of its production value. But make no mistake -- this is a bad movie."
rotten,A film that approaches Cruise like it's 1996. Never settles into a groove and it's constantly suffering from an identity crisis.
rotten,"If this is a sign of things to come, the ""Dark Universe"" should be buried and left to rot beside ""Dracula Untold."""
rotten,It will be exceptionally difficult to imagine anyone sticking around long enough to see what the franchise's future installments have to offer.
rotten,"You will not hate it but it's better to save your money and watch The Mummy with Brendan Fraser on Universal Channel, a little jewel that will put a smile on your face, this one instead will make you see double. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,A fairly forgettable and ill-conceived summer blockbuster...
rotten,It's a shame that Universal has allowed the production of an insultingly weak product. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,[The] direction is so unassured and nervous that it feels like he second guessed every choice in the film.
rotten,"The main problem with this new version is that it doesn't know what it wants. Or, rather, it knows what it wants, but there are so many things that it ends up stumbling over itself. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"This is the beginning of the ""Dark Universe"", and that only makes doubly painful this failed attempt to create a universe of films that could work better independently. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Sufficiently entertaining multiplex fodder, proficiently executed on a big scale with some neat signature scenes and enough loud noises to keep you awake."
rotten,"The Mummy is a prime example of how a big studio can ruin a film by misdirecting its focus on spectacle over a cogent story, something that audiences have grown weary of."
rotten,"If the future films are as monstrous as this one, it will be a dark universe indeed."
rotten,never really works because it is so focused on laying the groundwork for future installments that it sacrifices narrative engagement in the here and now.
rotten,The characters are empty and do nothing to prevent the movie from turning into a film where almost anything seems posible. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Some movies feel like they're made by a committee, The Mummy feels like it was made by a conference call during which nobody was listening to one another."
rotten,"A product made just to copy the Marvel formula, but without understanding exactly why that formula has worked so well. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It's mildly entertaining, though its numerous famous screenwriters won't be bragging at parties about its originality."
rotten,I don't want my Mummy.
rotten,Remember the scene in Dawn of Justice where Batman sends Wonder Woman an email explaining the plot of the next film? That's the entire second act here.
rotten,"Kurtzman prefers the kid fodder of zombies, rot and crazy double-irised eyeballs to romance. And by the time of the final wire-work fight, with Cruise and Boutelle throwing each other around the room, it's all just another bent tent pole."
rotten,Alex Kurtzman's The Mummy reboots a franchise I would gladly have dispensed with from the start.
rotten,You should skip it because it's worse than incompetent: It's soulless.
rotten,"A film that could have been a perfectly serviceable Tom Cruise vehicle had it not also had to lay out an overarching mythology for Universal's so-called ""Dark Universe""."
rotten,"Taken on its own, The Mummy is your standard sub-par summer blockbuster. The kind that will be forgotten very quickly. What makes the film worse is its standing as the apparent starting block for an ambitious new film series."
rotten,"It took me a while but it finally clicked about an hour into Alex Kurtzman's hilarible The Mummy that the whole thing wasn't a really bad movie, but a really bad videogame in bad-movie form."
fresh,"Not terribly terrible or terribly good, it is a terribly all over the place start to the Dark Universe but the ideas were there, they just needed coherently forming and not throwing together."
rotten,"While it is a nice twist to make The Mummy a princess, Sofia Boutella's bringer of destruction feels like a sideshow in her own story."
rotten,Worst Movie I've Seen In Months
rotten,[The film is] its own kind of black magic: an absolutely putrid movie without any of the fun normally associated with putrid movies.
rotten,"Had it not been for all the clumsy Dark Universe building, The Mummy might well have soared as an old-school, Gothic-era Monster Romp."
rotten,"Universal Studios misses an opportunity to bring back their classic monsters, deploying a franchise that fails at its start and a tomb nearby to see their boxing intentions buried. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,It reaches the minimum levels of entertainment but the truth is that we are before a film that it only goes halfway to what it aimed to be. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The characters read like they're from a recipe book, and, if we're being honest, it's a dish we've already had too many times."
rotten,"The Mummy is a lumbering monster of a film. Despite its limited intelligence, however, it is still capable of maximum destruction."
rotten,"Of the many huge problems with The Mummy, the most fatal is this: There's just plain no reason to care about any of it. (Splice Today)"
rotten,"The new Mummy is a woman, Princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella), whose lust to rule got her cursed and interred. Set free, she sucks the life from others and creates zombie servants. I'm not exactly sure you can chalk that up as a win for gender equality"
rotten,Pathetic on just about every level.
fresh,"The plot has more holes than Ahmanet's wrappings, the tone is all over the place, and the ending is a wreck. This is a terrible movie, yet somehow still kinda fun."
rotten,"It's not enough to promise moviegoers that the two hours of movie they just sat through will pay off in another year or two or three, when the sequel arrives. They have to pay off now."
fresh,Sloane and Jackson have wonderful chemistry...
fresh,"Holidate is a hilarious and heartfelt addition to the “holiday romcom” canon, carried commendably by Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey."
rotten,"Every scene is drudgery, every joke is homework, and every plot point is hell."
rotten,"The biggest issue with Holidate is that none of the characters are likable, least of all our two would-be lovers."
fresh,"This is more of a raunchy, well-made Hallmark Christmas special. It's a lighthearted escape that reminds us of how we use to celebrate the holidays before tragic times."
rotten,Rancid self-awareness and a complete lack of sincerity rule the holidate in this shallow rom-com.
rotten,"The movie is like those family Christmas dinners, once a year you can bear it but you certainly wouldn't repeat it. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"Holidate is far from a perfect rom-com, but it's a close to ideal distraction for a winter night at home, snuggled on the sofa in pajamas with a glass of Chardonnay in hand."
fresh,...Holidate improves considerably as it progresses...
rotten,I liked every one of the actors in this film but I didn't like the quagmire of crudeness that permeated just about every scene.
rotten,"Instead of doing something interesting and fresh, John Whitesell and his team have chosen to retread the same old eye-roll-worthy rom-com cliches that have plagued the laziest examples of the genre."
rotten,What started as a clever storyline quickly turned into an onscreen groundhog day-situation. The characters became monotonous and somewhat dull.
fresh,"This is not the wittiest or funniest rom-com you'll ever see, but there is something about it that keeps things in the watchable zone throughout."
rotten,Holidate fails at being a good rom-com. The film is incredibly messy and it was indeed a struggle to sit through.
fresh,"Raunchy romcom has sex, heavy drinking, and language"
rotten,"For all there is to criticize, Holidate does surprise us by presenting a relationship with an age gap in a positive way."
rotten,The film tries too hard to be a parody of romantic comedies. Maybe that was the general idea initially but the director seemingly lost touch with it as the film progressed.
rotten,"On the upside, Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey share a cute chemistry and both are adequately good in their roles. But that alone isn't enough to make Holidate a holiday treat to crave for."
rotten,"I wish the film had the guts to sit here longer, but, instead, it continues with the unnecessary chaos..."
fresh,"... Holidate is an often thrifty dose of pure, adulterated entertainment, even if the marketing would have you groan at its seemingly bored premise."
fresh,While the end result is never in question as it goes through the frustrating cliché hoops the genre demand there's still plenty of fun and laughs thanks to Roberts and Bracey.
fresh,"Holidateis a great start to the season of holiday rom-coms. It's relatable, it's cute, and it's raunchy. It's not a masterpiece but it is just a damn good start to Christmas - which apparently begins November 1st."
fresh,"The romantic and comedic pairing of Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey works, and makes for an enjoyable watch."
rotten,Holidate falls in the bland no-man's land between being sharp enough to appeal to adults (à la Bridesmaids) and tame enough to watch with the whole family.
rotten,"Holidate is -- hmm, I need a new word, some kind of portmanteau, to describe how bad it is. I know! It's horriflix."
rotten,"As bad as 2020 might seem, Holidate is here to remind us that '90s nostalgia isn't any better."
fresh,"Endearing, silly and fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The best thing that ""Holidate"" has going for it is that Roberts and Bracey do have great chemistry, but they just don't have a story or a script that can do it justice."
rotten,[A] resolutely mediocre romantic comedy...
rotten,I'd rather watch the Hallmark Channel.
fresh,"The film is, at times, indefensible, but I cannot lie - I laughed more than a I thought I would and damn if I didn't want to see Sloane and Jackson find their happily-ever-after, even as they fought it all the way."
rotten,"Holidate may be the movie equivalent of Peeps -- without substance, artificially flavored, consumed as an afterthought -- but Roberts is the bright dye that will make you forget the time it made you gag."
fresh,Proves that Netflix can do way more than just bang out the kind of fluffy Christmas comedies you see on cable.
rotten,"As amusing as a ""hand-job,"" and about as intimate."
fresh,"Holidate is hilarious, fun, a little bit predictable, and a whole lot of dirty! A romantic comedy that makes fun of romantic comedies."
fresh,A feel-good romantic chuckler layered with tasty seasonal schmaltz.
fresh,"It's not your typical romantic comedy, and it's the type of Christmas movie that fits more in the National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation camp than that of the Hallmark channel movies and those like them."
fresh,"""Holidate"" won't change your mind about the tread-worn challenges of romantic comedies, but its leads leverage their charms nicely."
rotten,You'll find better deals on the sale shelf at the Christmas Store - on Dec. 26.
fresh,"Like so much of Netflix's quantity over quality output, Holidate is broad, unsubtle, and seemingly designed to be half-watched, phone in hand. Yet within that framework, it finds a unique comedic spark that keeps it zipping along."
fresh,"Holiday cynics rejoice. Thanks to Holidate, we finally have our very own rom-com -- and it doesn't disappoint."
fresh,"They weather all these things with a panache that makes you warm to them, for it almost compensates for the script's utter predictability."
rotten,"Holidate distinguishes itself only through its reliance on boorish slapstick, exaggeration and vulgarity."
fresh,"A good premise for a romantic comedy well-versed in observing the genre's tropes, but less compelling when it's unwilling, or uninterested in subverting them."
fresh,"Despite there being quite a bit of silliness and even some low-brow humor in Holidate, it's definitely going to be a lot of people's guilty pleasure."
fresh,"There are quite a few good laughs throughout the movie, and really, if you're looking for something just mindless to throw on and use as a distraction from what's going on in the world, it's worth checking out."
rotten,"It's about as formulaic as you'd expect. That's not a problem in itself, but the problem is that Holidate takes so long to accept it's a generic romcom."
rotten,Surprisingly raunchy and unfunny holiday comedy. Disappointing
rotten,Often goes crude because it's too much work to be clever.
rotten,"It's by no means the worst rom com out there, but it is clichéd, predictable and dull."
rotten,"Holidate does not have a single authentic moment, appealing character, or genuine laugh."
fresh,"Holidate might not be on the same level of Home Alone, Elf, or National Lampoon's Xmas Vacation but there's enough here worthy of repeat viewings."
rotten,"An excruciatingly cheesy, hopelessly dated, profoundly unfunny and tone-deaf romantic comedy..."
rotten,"Holidate, though, isn't interested in being interesting - it's a stocking filler with the same appeal as a Christmas jumper; you shove it on because it's comforting and it's the right time of year for it, but you wouldn't leave the house with it on."
fresh,"The movie surprises on almost every level, breaking a number of contemporary rom-com rules along the way thanks to Tiffany Paulsen's self-aware screenplay."
rotten,"Predictability doesn't have to be a sin when it comes to the often paint-by-the-numbers world of romantic comedy, but this awkward combination of expectation and disdain for it make for a film only fleetingly worthy of celebration."
rotten,How many gatherings will it take before these reluctant beaus admit to their affection? Better to bail early.
fresh,"Like all Netflix rom-coms, Holidate has a quirky and promising premise, but what sets it apart from some more recent debacles is that it actually pulls this off."
rotten,"The narrative's inevitable resolution tends to hinder your complete affection - and ironically, makes it feel like something you're settling for."
rotten,"""Holidate"" knows it's hitting every branch as it falls down the cliché tree. Does that soften the landing? Nope."
rotten,Everything poignant and evocative about Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol has been rendered flat by Disney’s latest adaptation.
fresh,Morbidly dark and frighteningly realistic - almost as if Tim Burton had a hand in the design.
fresh,Christmas magic never fails to touch the heart and spirit and neither will A CHRISTMAS CAROL. God Bless Us Everyone.
rotten,"Even though it is quite a loyal adaptation of the classic tale, A Christmas Carol doesn't quite manage to land as a Disney film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Despite these advances in motion capture, A Christmas Carol still has some deficiencies. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,This film will wind up being forgotten. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"In the end, the only emotion generated is anger-that this is how a whole generation of kids will get their first taste of A Christmas Carol."
rotten,"The elegant simplicity of Dickens' novel is lost somewhere underneath the eye-popping visuals, whittled down to nothing more than a series of pixels and binary code."
fresh,I know it isn't perfect but I really like it.
rotten,"A chilly, cold-to-the-touch interpretation."
rotten,"This computerised version of A Christmas Carol automatically loses something in becoming very homogenised and, dare I say it, Americanised."
rotten,"This, I told myself, is going to suck. And in most ways, it does suck as fully as expected. But there are, surprisingly, a few decent points, too."
fresh,"While for some there is something disconcerting about the lifeless eyes of the otherwise life like characters, it certainly lends itself to large 3D cinemas, with rubber faced characters and grand sweeping movement."
fresh,"If you are officially done with Halloween, and you're ready to start feeling like Christmas is right around the corner, then this movie is a must."
fresh,One cannot help but feel the same effect could have been accomplished by simply making a live action film with state-of-the-art visual effects.
fresh,A remarkable and effective adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel that manages to overcome the familiarity of its source material and become something more fulfilling.
fresh,"The biggest surprise is that Zemeckis, so often in thrall to his digital palette, here uses it to freshly illuminate a time-honored text."
fresh,"A supernatural parable of terrifying, chain-rattling spirits and mind-warping time travel, with a theme of social responsibility that extends far beyond seasonal cheer."
rotten,Bah humbug: Zemeckis and Carrey screw with Scrooge.
rotten,Zemeckis and Disney's collaboration brings about a cold and forgettable variation using the advent of animation and technology to destroy the magic...
fresh,"Zemeckis's retelling of A Christmas Carol is solid, most importantly letting the story itself shine through where it naturally does."
rotten,Creepy animation and a somewhat tired retelling might have you longing for the Muppet adaptation instead. At least the film's 3D-designed visuals are breathtaking.
fresh,"The 1951 Alastair Sim version still ranks as the Number 1 Christmas Carol, but this mo-cap CGI animated version comes in a close second."
rotten,"With a price tag of $175 million, Zemeckis might have even been able to pinch some pennies by abandoning the mo-cap and filming A Christmas Carol in live action. Hmm, I sound a little like Scrooge. Bah humbug!"
rotten,"Just like a new cover version of a classic song, A Christmas Carol is all crisp technology, same ol' structure, and a lot of spirit as substitute for a lack of soul."
fresh,click to read full review
rotten,The effects work here is far beyond a tech wizard showing off; it's more like watching Zemeckis lose his mind. He seems so obsessed with what he can do with the FX that he doesn't stop to consider whether he should.
fresh,"What's good is very good and what's bad is sadly bad. I wish I could cut a montage of the sobering and well-thought-out segue from Present to Future, the swooping flights through London and Scrooge's amazing face."
rotten,There's a certain irony in having a timeless tale about a man finding his soul being told in the most soulless way possible
fresh,Its' lavish details bridge the gap between the real and the imagined in a way heretofore impossible.. the filmmakers have put most of their magic in the media and not the message.
rotten,Robert Zemeckis' infatuation with the motion-capture animation process has officially gone too far...
fresh,"There's no heart, and I don't put it simply on the visuals that almost look real at times. Amazing 3D is the only thing this dark version does really well."
rotten,...there isn't much to fall in love with in Robert Zemeckis's visually overpowering motion-capture-animation...
rotten,"takes full advantage of the technologies available, but fails to illuminate or otherwise expand Dickens' story in any meaningful ways"
fresh,"If you're remaking a classic merely to one-up whoever remade it previously, is it really worth the effort? Fortunately, Jim Carrey decided not to waste a wasted opportunity."
rotten,Watching the humans in this live action/animation combo is like watching 'Zombies On Parade'
rotten,The 3D isn't enough to justify yet another version of this familiar tale; the film seems more opportunistic than necessary.
fresh,This film is dark and scary enough that it just might scare some in the audience straight.
fresh,"It is done with skill and imagination, and overseen by a director, Robert Zemeckis, who knows the value of occasionally quietening things down for a bit of tension or a precisely timed joke."
fresh,Faithfully rendered and extremely frightening.
fresh,"What's curious about the movie is that you can tart it up all you want, but Dickens' words still resonate, his characters still infuriate, frighten and touch, and there's still satisfaction to be had in his tale."
fresh,Jamais deixa de impressionar.
fresh,The greatest tension in this adaptation of A Christmas Carol isn't between Scrooge and those pesky ghosts but within writer-director Robert Zemeckis.
rotten,"It's a film so determined to make you notice it, that it comes across like an obnoxious child screaming, 'Look at me!'"
fresh,"... the heart of the story is there, and Zemeckis honors and respects it."
fresh,"Leaving aside the technology behind Robert Zemeckis' animated A Christmas Carol, this is the most satisfying version of Charles Dickens' oft-told tale in years."
rotten,The real nightmare before Christmas - way too scary for the kiddies and not nearly warm enough for audiences of all ages.
fresh,"The motion capture animation is top-notch and it's hard not to be impressed with what Robert Zemeckis has wrought, even if there's the occasional sense he's pandering to an audience that can't get through a 90 minute story without a few yuks and a chase."
rotten,"The biggest surprise... is that it isn't absolutely dreadful. Perfectly pointless, maybe, but not dreadful."
fresh,"The 3-D motion-capture version runs through the motions, except for one detail: It's visually beautiful."
fresh,"'My next project is to motion capture some hair and comb it over my 3D scalp,' said Zemeckis."
rotten,Robert Zemeckis seeks to answer the one question still remaining about the Dickens classic: What would the story look like if it were cast with figures from Madame Tussauds?
rotten,Those who enjoy virtual roller-coaster rides and long falls from high places are encouraged to attend.
fresh,"As a dedicated fan of Charles Dickens' works, I also am a dedicated fan of several versions of his classic ""A Christmas Carol."""
fresh,"Hold onto your mug of warm apple cider. This newest, action-packed version of A Christmas Carol could get a little bumpy."
rotten,Seeming spawned from some ghoulish dream I felt nothing warm or symbolic of a tradition from this film.
rotten,"Are the less than perfectly executed bits supposed to set off the truly terrific ones, or are the truly terrific ones supposed to distract the viewing audience from the bits that go clunk in the night?"
rotten,...we never experience that moment when Scrooge's heart melts. He seems already changed the moment Marley leaves him.
fresh,"Yes %u2014 I am giving A Christmas Carol a high rating. It is technical perfection and brilliantly done. However, it is too much Zemeckis, too much Carrey. Not enough Dickens."
rotten,"Writer-director Robert Zemeckis follows Charles Dickens' 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol, so closely that he even makes the same error the author made with the first edition of the book."
rotten,"You don't need glasses -- 3-D or otherwise -- to see that this holiday release is too diluted for adults, too frightening for children, and too tiresome for just about everybody."
fresh,"Most of us know the beginning, middle, and uplifting end. However, the hook this time is a trifecta: 3-D, digital imagery, and Jim Carrey. That hook makes this 'Christmas Carol' worth seeing."
rotten,A garish and tedious animated interpretation of the Charles Dickens classic that has neither heart nor soul.
rotten,"Boasts dazzling CGI effects and important moral lessons, but it suffers from excessive style over substance while lacking the genuine, unadulturated warmth, emotional resonance and soul of the Dickens classic."
rotten,Scrooge's ultimate transformation to kindness and charity comes too late and is given little screen time. Carrey never gets a chance to be the funny comedian that has endeared him to his legion of fans.
fresh,There are already so many great adaptions of the classic Dickens story %u2013 this one adds nothing but CGI and gimmicky 3D effects.
rotten,Zemeckis seems unable to admit that the motion capture animation he's been using on The Polar Express and Beowulf is an artistic dead end.
fresh,"exactly what I expected from Zemeckis and company. With the Dickens story as the foundation, it's perfect for the holiday season"
fresh,"Yes, Zemeckis does throw in a few gratuitous moments where things are flying at your face, but he ends up using enough restraint to ensure the 3D doesn't overwhelm your senses or take away from Dickens' stirring story about greed and redemption."
rotten,The only major change Disney's A Christmas Carol takes with the source material is draining the humanity right out of it.
fresh,How they made it into this Disney adaptation unprettified is a Christmas miracle in itself.
rotten,Zemeckis... appears to have given up making fantasies for grownups in favor of making theme-park attractions designed to do nothing more than shut the kiddies up for 90 minutes...
fresh,In the end you don't have to analyze it... that tear in your eye tells you it's working.
rotten,"Too bad though, that for all the eye-popping spirits on screen, it lacks a soul."
fresh,"Although Dickens has been translated time and time again, this animated adventure is no humbug."
rotten,"Call me a Scrooge, but I'll pass on this synthetic version of that most humanistic of tales."
fresh,Zemeckis' film preserves much of Dickens' original dialogue and detail while amplifying the utter ethereal strangeness of the ghosts.
fresh,There's a lot of dark magic in this Dickensian Yuletide.
rotten,Want the creeps for Christmas? Then check out the latest version of A Christmas Carol.
fresh,Does this entertainment achieve a timelessness beyond its exquisite source material? Not even. Yet there's pleasure to be had and relief in feeling the filmmakers didn't Scrooge it up either.
fresh,Disney's excessively hyped A Christmas Carol brings Dickensian details to such sumptuous life that you mostly forgive it for possessing a stop-motion soul.
fresh,"The movie may be yet another retelling of an iconic story, but visually it is often quite breathtaking."
rotten,"Zemeckis captures all the story's terror, but its pathos has always been the real challenge, and it mostly eludes him."
rotten,"You don't identify with Scrooge at any point, nor is blatant fakery scary. Picture The Seventh Seal with sock puppets."
fresh,A branded piece of shiny seasonal entertainment.
fresh,"Robert Zemeckis turns the classic Dickens tale into a 3D performance-capture spectacle, abetted by the versatility of Jim Carrey as skinflint Scrooge and his ghostly visitors."
fresh,Succeeds in delivering a respectful--if not always magical--interpretation of Dickens' famous tale.
fresh,all science and little sentiment
rotten,It feels like Zemeckis wanted to make one movie (a socially relevant ghost story) and Disney wanted another (a Polar Express-type movie). It doesn't work.
rotten,"The good news about A Christmas Carol, then, is that Dickens' story -- the pure power of it, the grace and gentleness, the sensibility and sentiment of it -- cannot be drowned or destroyed no matter how many technicians and dollars are thrown at it."
fresh,A splendidly mounted and visually imaginative animated 3D version of the classic novel.
rotten,"For the most part, Zemeckis delivers a faithful interpretation of Dickens' work in this PG-rated holiday tale. What he misses out on capturing is the spirit of Dickens' story."
fresh,...a remarkable and effective adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel that manages to overcome the familiarity of its source material and become something more fulfilling.
fresh,"this is not the Scrooge McDuck or Mr. Magoo version of the classic Charles Dickens tale, this A Christmas Carol is the dark, challenging and frightening version of the story"
fresh,"Cinematographer Robert Presley and the design team provide many instances of graphical triumph, influenced by silent cinema."
rotten,"As for this 'performance capture,' rife with characters sporting the annoying wandering eye, it might be time for an intervention, ghostly or not. You're a filmmaker, Mr. Z, not a puppeteer. Enough is enough."
rotten,This Hollywood adaptation is as glossy as Christmas wrapping paper and just as disposable.
rotten,"A Christmas Carol should be as cosy and familiar as piping-hot tea and buttered, toasted crumpets, not a brain-battering sensory assault that feels like downing tequila shots on a rollercoaster."
rotten,"There is a weird lack of passion here, almost condescension, a sense that Scrooge's agonised moral journey into his past is potentially pretty dull, and so Zemeckis is always livening things up by whooshing the old miser excitingly through the night sky."
fresh,Zemeckis has succeeded is transforming a staid and over-familiar story into a rip-roaring and viscerally powerful special effects chase-movie.
rotten,The whizzing pyrotechnics aren't quite enough to make this a Christmas classic.
fresh,"A Christmas Carol is certainly set to win the nation's attention. With all this hype, we'd hoped for something a bit more special."
fresh,"It is an experience, being stunning to look at -- and you'll only get the full effect from seeing it on the big screen, rather than waiting for the DVD."
fresh,Zemeckis brightens up the screen with beautiful visual effects but had trouble bringing anything new to this already amazing story that we have heard a million times before.
rotten,"Charles Dickens's reflective, universal story becomes fodder for a technological thrill ride starring a rough approximation of Jim Carrey."
fresh,Sometimes the richness of the visual banquet threatens to leave viewers with Christmas afternoon indigestion yet never stops you feeling hungry for more.
fresh,"In a very real sense, this version of A Christmas Carol is the most faithful to Charles Dickens' original text ever filmed."
fresh,"A strikingly animated and thoroughly magical 3-D adaptation... that, counter to so many other versions, beautifully captures the darkly intense vibe of Dickens' ghost story."
rotten,It's a heartwarmer that doesn't have much of a heart itself.
fresh,"If you want an entertaining period piece, you could do a lot worse than attend Robert Zemeckis' A Christmas Carol."
fresh,Disney's excessively hyped A Christmas Carol revels so richly in bringing the Dickensian details to sumptuous life that you wind up forgiving it for possessing a stop-motion soul.
fresh,A near-perfect blend of looks and heart.
rotten,A technically proficient but disturbing adaptation (that) adopts a surprisingly macabre tone.
rotten,It's like taking a Christmas wreath and dipping it in wax or laminating a Christmas card in plastic. Zemeckis risks creating another Yule ghoul: the Ghost of Christmas Without Soul.
fresh,"As the lead character, Carrey's CG-created body is spindly and bent, and he has fun with his vocal performance, turning every word into a strangled hiss."
fresh,"The use of 3-D leaves the not unpleasant sensation that snow is gently falling throughout the entire cinema. A respectable, high-tech stab at an old favourite but the Alastair Sim version remains the best."
rotten,"After round two in Jim Carrey vs. Holiday Classics, it's Carrey 2, Classics 0."
fresh,"The story is robust enough to survive the theme-park treatment, and for the most part it's a very good ride, with a welcome note of actual Christmas caroling spirit."
fresh,"Dickens purists can stay away. Others can feel free to sample the rollicking aerial views of Victorian London, the droll and scary elasticity of Carrey."
fresh,Scores high on swooping visuals and meticulous draughtsmanship.
rotten,...fares even worse than its noxious reputation might’ve indicated.
rotten,"In a 40-year career in horror, David Cronenberg never dreamed up an image as chilling or stomach-churning as Dana Carvey as a human turtle."
rotten,"While some of the make-up effects are mildly diverting (Carvey disguises himself as a turtle and a cherry pie), they hardly make up for the lame screenplay, barely coherent plot and increasingly desperate mugging."
rotten,"The humor here is relentlessly juvenile, and not even the kids in the audience seemed to like it much."
rotten,"It is not as funny as it could be, and none of it makes sense, especially Pistachio's ability to mimic any dialect but standard US English. But his versatility is astonishing."
rotten,A film about as funny as a seeping wound.
rotten,"Such a sad irony that Dana Carvey, who's made his name bringing celebrities to life with uncanny impersonations, should make such a lifeless movie based on characters of his own creation."
rotten,A messy disappointment for Dana Carvey fans.
rotten,"This is a bad flick that will appeal mostly to kids ranging from ages 5-11, but adults will leave halfway through. I found it almost tolerable."
rotten,This misfiring disaster shows just how over-estimated Carvey's writing and acting talent has been.
rotten,... Mike Myers has already milked this type of gag-dense character comedy bone dry.
rotten,George W. Bush in the flesh would have been much funnier than this movie's impersonation.
rotten,"There follows a fusillade of farts, dud sight gags and inconsequential butt jokes."
rotten,"Master of Disguise may be a real hoot, if you're under 10 years old, or drunk, or both. Not a bad time-waster on a rainy Sunday, but a time-waster nonetheless."
rotten,"It is virtually impossible to watch The Master of Disguise and not feel embarrassed for stars Dana Carvey, Jennifer Esposito, and Brent Spiner."
rotten,"In the end, Dana Carvey is left wishing he could disguise himself as Mike Myers, or himself circa 1986. At least then, he would be funny again."
rotten,"The worst film ever made: a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots."
rotten,The fart jokes get the biggest laughs.
rotten,"...Occasional moments of Carvey genius (many of which are seen in the trailer) sprinkled sparsely throughout a senseless, leaden production..."
rotten,"It is cut with all the precision and timing of an irritating kids' TV show, with kids themselves in charge of the production, and their pets operating the equipment."
rotten,"In the dire The Master of Disguise, Carvey is seen to maximum disadvantage as a dim-witted Italian-American waiter whose family have an inherited gift for turning themselves into anyone from Bo Derek to George Bush."
rotten,This is a serious contender for the title of The Worst Film Ever Made.
rotten,"It's a great, resonant comic premise, yet the film fails on every level, partly due to Carvey's charmless passive-aggressive manner - lacking the abrasive edge of Lewis or Adam Sandler, he's nakedly winsome, a puppy yapping for love."
rotten,Never have so many jokes clunked off the screen to such a silent audience. And never has 80 minutes seemed like such an eternity.
rotten,I have to sit through it; it's my job. You don't.
rotten,"The film's only laughs come when Pistachio is off the screen, and dressed as someone else."
rotten,The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe.
rotten,Rarely has such a talented comedian been so wildly out of touch with what's funny.
fresh,Carvey has been dipped in fairy dust in a bid to dazzle a new and different kid audience.
rotten,In just over a minute you can see everything that's wrong with this one-joke farce.
rotten,The Master of Disguise is awful. It's Pauly Shore awful. Don't say you weren't warned.
rotten,"The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart, mind or humor of its own."
rotten,"...it is definitely a come down to see the resilient comic attached to this excruciating, infantile flick. Conversely, Carvey needs to go incognito with the flaccid family fare The Master of Disguise"
rotten,"Lacks originality, inspiration and invention."
rotten,"On the bright side, it contains Jesse Ventura's best work since the XFL."
rotten,"Mostly this happy train wreck feels like a longer, better movie that was chopped up and reassembled by retarded monkeys."
rotten,"An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill Saturday Night Live skits."
rotten,I've always been a fan of Dana Carvey. How could someone so funny turn out a movie as pathetic as this?
rotten,I cannot disguise my feelings - this film sucks.
rotten,"This pathetic junk is barely an hour long. Nevertheless, it still seems endless."
rotten,"If The Master of Disguise had been a free cable movie -- well, I still wouldn't have recommended it."
rotten,"Quite honestly, I've never seen anything less competent. And I mean that."
rotten,"Sadly, 'Garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'Wayne.'"
rotten,The Master of Diguise is this year's first truly stillborn comedy.
rotten,... The cinematic equivalent of the 8-year-old hooligan who mocks you by repeating everything you say.
rotten,"so misconceived on every level, it's almost fascinating to watch. If you don't mind pain, that is. This movie knows how to make you hurt..."
rotten,An unfunny waste of time.
rotten,"A gimmick in search of a movie: how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible, plot mechanics be damned."
rotten,"This wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt, it's the worst movie I've seen this summer."
rotten,Adults may find this film as amusing as an old lady slipping on a banana peel.
rotten,Not even a master of disguise can make this sloppy slapstick look like anything more than an incoherent cowpie of a comedy.
rotten,"The film contains no good jokes, no good scenes, barely a moment when Carvey's Saturday Night Live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment."
rotten,"Unfortunately, Carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with Harris Goldberg."
rotten,"There's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer. Or for the year, for that matter."
rotten,Just another loop in Dana Carvey's shame spiral; a path that begins right where Wayne's World 2 ends.
rotten,The Master of Disguise is easily one of the worst movies of 2002.
rotten,The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants... who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds.
rotten,"Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer's worst movie."
rotten,Painfully unfunny and misguided to boot.
rotten,"The only camouflage Carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public, to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers."
rotten,"It showcases Carvey's talent for voices, but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff."
rotten,"If repeated farting sounds, lame and disjointed comedy, and the name Pistachio Disguisey make you laugh, perhaps you'll find something redeeming here."
rotten,"At times, it actually hurts to watch."
rotten,[A] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment.
rotten,"Dana Carvey makes a lackadaisical 'comeback' as a man of a thousand faces, none of them funny."
rotten,It's the one summer movie you simply can't afford to see.
rotten,No amount of nostalgia for Carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it.
rotten,"A calamitous attempt at reviving the anarchic, little-kid spirit of Jerry Lewis."
rotten,Only a human vegetable could have possibly viewed the final cut and not have had any vocal concerns about the submerged level of quality on display.
rotten,No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise.
rotten,"The Master of Disguise is full of jokes, but just about the only one that provokes widespread giggles from the short-pants set is the villain's tendency to have his maniacal laughing fits cut short by inadvertent toots of flatulence."
rotten,Master of Disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours.
rotten,"If you really want Carvey to make you laugh, you're better off watching an old SNL repeat. From the 1980s."
rotten,"An embarrassing mess for all involved, this so-called family comedy is about as unfunny as unfunny gets. Even its fart jokes are below the industry standard."
rotten,"Despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults."
rotten,Dana Carvey is slowly strangling his own legacy with an inane script and flatulence jokes that could've been written on the elementary school playground.
rotten,A painfully unfunny mess.
rotten,"Pity first-time filmmaker Perry Andelin Blake, who tries to make the best of this mess, despite being saddled with a star who seems to have no self-restraint, and who clearly has had his sense of what's funny and what's not seriously impaired."
rotten,Neither [Carvey] nor semi-competent director Perry Andelin Blake have the ability to sustain a scene or idea.
rotten,"The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time."
rotten,The Master of Disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live.'
rotten,This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
rotten,The Master of Disguise finds Carvey woefully out of practice.
rotten,"Dana Carvey's kid-friendly comedy about a ""man of a thousand faces"" has perhaps five laughs."
rotten,The Master Of Disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy.
rotten,"In a big corner office in Hell, Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender, is firing his R&D people, and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24/7."
rotten,The isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor.
rotten,"The Master of Disguise is funny--not ""ha ha"" funny, ""dead circus performer"" funny. And for all the wrong reasons besides."
rotten,"A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting, shooting or post-production stages."
rotten,"It's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak, and it has been unearthed and released now, when it has become even weaker."
rotten,Cruelly and brutally unfunny.
rotten,It doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.
rotten,"The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch, but a great movie it is not."
rotten,"'Disguise the limit' is the film's punning promotional slogan, but 'Rock Bottom' is more like it."
rotten,"A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless, witless, and devoid of anything resembling humor."
rotten,"Master of Disguise feels like something that was left on the shelf, hacked to bits and thrown into theaters."
rotten,"I really wanted to get up and walk out, but morbid curiousity held me in my seat to see if it ever got any better. It didn't. This blows beyond imagination."
rotten,A comedic train wreck that could very well make Carvey the next Joe Piscopo.
rotten,"The Master of Disguise is a disjointed film that, but for brief flashes of comedic verve, should skip theatrical release and go straight to video."
rotten,"Boiled down to its essence, this is little more than a cheesy vehicle for Carvey's one-shot gags, and an inconsistent one at that."
rotten,"Non-stop, bad slapstick ... When it can't think anything else to do, the script falls back on those old reliables, flatulence jokes and pratfalls."
rotten,"With a ""Spy Kids"" sequel opening next week, why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a ""SNL"" has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling Roberto Benigni?"
rotten,"Surrealistically horrid...it's all about makeup and completely lacking in wit, style or even simple dumb fun."
rotten,...simply not acceptable
rotten,Venom is yet another missed opportunity to deliver a great movie about the symbiote anti-hero.
fresh,"Despite the movie's flaws – which there are a lot – ""Venom"" surpasses a lot of that negativity through what is does really well: that is, the relationship between Venom and Eddie."
rotten,"Ironically, the film lacks a bit of bite..."
rotten,"Ultimately it’s the script and some pretty uninspired action that left me feeling a bit deflated. Sadly a good Tom Hardy, Fleisher’s edgy ambition, or even a killer end credits scene can’t quite keep “Venom” from disappointing."
rotten,Venom blandly wants you to shut up and consume. It really is worth pondering whether or not you should.
rotten,"At least MCU titles mask their commercialism in their devotion to characters and telling a good story. By contrast, Venom seems like a knock-off, or perhaps a throwback to the early-2000s era of superhero movies that is best left forgotten."
rotten,It's too endearing to write off just as its too basic to really make a mark.
fresh,It's really silly... it's still a lot of fun.
fresh,This is the one with the most teeth and most tater tots.
fresh,Episode 11: Moving On
rotten,"The first half hour of the film feels very rushed, as if the director is trying to get all the backstory and all the set up out of the way, sucking away all the emotional investment that the viewer is supposed to have."
fresh,Venom offers a nice reminder that there's still a lot of entertainment to be had in a film that just wants to be crazy fun -- and then delivers on that promise.
rotten,A flawed beast that feels 10 years out of time....
rotten,"It feels unintentionally funny, as if all the actors except for Hardy understood they were acting in a generic comic book movie. He's a hoot, the movie isn't."
rotten,This could be the most inane Marvel put on the screen.
rotten,"After the horror and comedy disperse, the film transitions into an action picture, full of flurries of CG tendrils and sludge."
rotten,"In the end, I'd avoid this film. It's a film without intent and carrying little enjoyment or entertainment factor."
fresh,"Has some fun set-pieces and worked around the lack of Spider-Man well, but the finale is disappointing and every character who isn't Brock is rather dull and one-dimensional."
fresh,If you don't allow yourself to surrender to it all? You're going to hate Venom.
rotten,Predictable and repeated story. Venom without Spider-Man is lame. The film relapses into the absurd and gives us 0 connection between Eddie Brock and Venom. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"[I]t all feels so constrained by its PG-13 rating, and with the anarchy appearing so anesthetized, it's up to Hardy to carry the picture to the finish line."
rotten,Venom is basically The Mask with a slobbery tongue and none of Jim Carrey's slapstick charm.
rotten,"Venom feels like something Sony made so they could retain control over one of the few aspects of the Spider-verse they still owned. Without Spidey to anchor the storyline, though, it just feels adrift."
fresh,"It's worth focusing your attention on Tom Hardy's amazing, physical, and enthusiastic performance. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"I can't say I like Venom and I can't say I hate Venom, but I am glad I watched it. It's a bizarre slice of schlock insanity that's simultaneously the product of out-of-control interference by the studio and the singular dedication of Tom Hardy."
rotten,"I suppose one could say that about just about any bad movie, but Venom's energy and a couple of its performances elevate it above the worst of the worst... It's also a very bad movie, make no mistake."
fresh,I didn't hate this movie... I had a fun time.
fresh,"A stupid, fun time."
fresh,"The film devotes way too much time to exposition (the first act feels like it goes on for about an hour), but once it gets going it's decent fun."
fresh,I would like to watch more of Eddie and Venom bantering about their common character defects and possibly eating people.
rotten,"Above all, it's a poorly conceived script which hurts the film in the end."
rotten,"Tom Hardy gives it his all, but Venom falls short in almost every way. It has bad acting, bad pacing and editing, and a silly yet still somehow dull plot. It's another swing and a miss from Sony."
rotten,The final product looks like the result of a lot of last-minute reworking.
rotten,"Venom can't be saved by Tom Hardy's unique performance and there's so much here that doesn't work, it makes for frustrating viewing and is a complete and utter disappointment."
fresh,"The movie grinds through its first half, and takes far too long to get Venom and Eddie together. But once the monster and man do become one, the plot picks up dramatically."
rotten,This is one hot mess that will enrage Marvel fans and confuse newbies.
fresh,"The funny, often random bits of dialogue echo a classic vaudeville duo and allow Hardy to display an exciting, awkward comedic side rarely seen from the often serious actor."
rotten,The result is so infantile that you barely care to wait for the mandatory mid-credit Marvel teasers.
rotten,"But outside of the odd thrills to be found in his actual portrayal of Venom, the movie is basically trash, a project destined for a home alongside Catwoman and Elektra in every Bad Superhero Movie listicle to be published until the end of time."
rotten,"It is a forgettable film that doesn't properly entertain and feels completely unnecessary. For those looking for a good movie about a charming but flawed bearded white dude working with a presence in his head to take out scores of bad guys, see UPGRADE."
rotten,"Venom as a CGI creature is brilliant to watch, especially when he makes those formidable shields and weapons... But these bits and pieces are not enough to keep one interested through the length of the movie."
rotten,It has so many weaknesses that I would never recommend it to anyone. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Venom is a narrative nightmare in which every scene feels rushed. And yet, by the power of slimy black tentacles, possessed dogs and children, and Hardy's fearless lunacy, it is a wickedly watchable experience."
rotten,"a surprisingly generic, listless film, filled with poorly rendered CGI effects and painfully tin-eared dialogue."
fresh,"In theory it is almost aggressively ridiculous, and yet if you're willing to suspend your disbelief, there is a slightly childlike sincerity to it that becomes irresistible."
rotten,Venom feels like very much feels like a relic of the past that hasn't bothered to adapt to the superhero genre's changing times.
fresh,"From the comic book nods, to the amazing battles, and on point CGI - comic fans will love Venom. A few plot holes & some humor is a miss, but overall a super fun movie!"
rotten,"Immensely flawed, packed full of cheese and occasionally hokey effects, and far removed from any of the grandeur achieved within the Marvel Universe"
fresh,"Venom is, at its worst, incredibly messy, though at its best it's fun, slightly horrific, and an accidental slice of superhero socialism."
rotten,"Would be way more fun if the superhero fodder was dropped and we had 90 minutes of Hardy and his alien interloper arguing, eating people and arguing about eating people."
rotten,"It often feels like the bad ideas are methodically consuming the good ones - not unlike the symbiotes themselves - but if you can stay awake through the dreadful first hour, there's definitely some fun to be had."
fresh,"For those who long for a comic-book alternative that exemplifies often-overlooked comedic elements, Venom will leave you in stitches."
rotten,Venom is a profoundly disappointing and frustrating take on the popular comic book antihero. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Despite having some great talents involved, the film lacks any sort of depth to make it memorable."
fresh,There's a lot of fun to be had if you go in and turn your brain off and go with it.
rotten,"It'd be nice to say that Hardy, a fine actor, is actually given a chance to act. But he's basically just a Looney-Tunes punching bag."
rotten,I can't really recommend it but it's not awful.
rotten,"Venom is a treat only because of Hardy but try as he might (he does very much so), the actor cannot shoulder the disappointing film."
rotten,"Though Tom Hardy is game and the ""friends with Venefits"" shtick is fun and clever, the overall story is too messy and cornball for the combination of the two to stick the landing."
rotten,"An appalling trainwreck of a film; a bad idea, executed poorly in an attempt to make a quick buck."
rotten,It seems too many variables have led to a shallow antihero that doesn't hold up to Fox or Marvel Studio's offerings. Venom deserved better than that.
rotten,"It's such a bizarre mixture of tones that Venom feels like the perfect successor to The Amazing Spider-Man films, almost to the point where you begin to wonder whether or not this was originally intended to be a spinoff to those films."
fresh,"The Venom relationship isn't swoon worthy, but it's actually a whole lot of fun."
rotten,"Jenny Slate, kudos to you for getting one of those superhero movie paychecks. If only this film were worthy of your talent..."
fresh,"Takes what it has, runs with it and bounces around within its parameters to mostly engaging effect."
rotten,"An entertainingly skittish performance by Tom Hardy keeps things lively, but Venom falls short of the bar raised by other Marvel fare, thanks to mediocre filmmaking and a refusal to push the boundaries."
fresh,"If nothing else, it's a mostly fun monster movie that proves Tom Hardy can put on any mask and shine through."
fresh,"It's too much of a stretch to say Venom is ""good,"" but it's certainly not terrible, and maybe worth seeing for Hardy alone."
fresh,"The action is not bad, and as rubber-stamp superhero films go, it's adequate."
rotten,"Mild action sequences, dumb script and cartoonish special effects make of Venom a poor superhero movie. The worst thing: a lame villain."
rotten,"Al igual que otras películas del género, Venom no añade absolutamente nada, pero lo peor es que se sienta como un completo retroceso."
rotten,"One of the lamest superhero sagas to venture down the pike in quite some time, with Tom Hardy aping '90s-era Jim Carrey."
rotten,"Hardcore fans of the comics may enjoy Venom more than an average moviegoer, but the film is ultimately too weird and confusing with an ending that's just stupid."
fresh,It succeeds as a piece of entertainment despite the foundational lunacy upon which it was built.
rotten,"Venom feels like several competing films -- A Jekyll and Hyde story, an odd couple movie, a broad comedy -- stitched together into one incoherent mess"
rotten,"Well, sorry to break it to you, but Venom is one massive missed opportunity."
rotten,"...Come to enjoy Tom Hardy acting crazy and some slick visuals. Other than that, it's likely you'll be disappointed on some level."
rotten,The entire endeavor has a bitter aftertaste that frequently overwhelms the sensibility of mad spectacle that Fleischer and his performers strive to tease from the material.
rotten,"It's not a good movie, but considering the box office numbers, it won't be long until we see the sequel that this movie ham-fistedly foreshadowed."
fresh,"Venom is not the best Marvel movie, however, it will show you a good time after work. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,VENOM is fun. But it is not 'good fun' if you understand.
rotten,"Feels like a comic book adaptation that was scripted in the late 1990s, filmed in the mid-2000s, and given a CGI facelift in the last couple of years (but not a good one)."
rotten,A movie that pushes any intellectual connotation warrants much more careful and precise technical values. Halfway through this film and I was ready to pop an ibuprofen.
rotten,"It's loud, ugly, and seriously...what is going on with Tom Hardy? Blink once if you need help, Tom."
rotten,"A dumb script, bad CGI and poor plotting all combine to make a film that feels as though it is a bad joke at someone's expense. ​"
rotten,"If you're not going to do right by these characters, go give Marvel them back. Why are you still trying to make all this money if you're not doing right by the fans?"
rotten,"If Venom ends up becoming the Green Lantern (that Tom) Hardy makes on the way to something better, then all Hardy's effort will have been worth it."
rotten,"This is a creature out of the most sordid depths of superhero movies, the blockbuster synonymous with junk good that has nothing to offer and sucks the life out of its talented cast. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Marvel Studios have now officially hit the bottom of the barrel as one of its third-rate, C-grade creations known mainly to Marvel's fanboy base gets his own mediocre movie."
fresh,Imagine if Rick Moranis had an alien in his head that sounded like Freddy Krueger and you start to see where the movie is going.
rotten,"Like Brock's relationship with Venom, the movie exists in constant turmoil between dueling desires to be simultaneously formulaic and spontaneous."
rotten,"Venom poisons the well of its own goodwill by a series of misfiring, illogical plot points and lack of respect for its own universe's rules."
rotten,"An aimless, awful embarrassment for everyone involved, Venom imagines a world where a dopey Peter Parker-type was instead bitten by a radioactive turd."
rotten,"A bafflingly stupid anti-hero feature that left me with a ton of questions such as, ""What is Tom Hardy doing with his career?"" and, ""Why does Venom have to be so eat-y?"""
rotten,"Venom is a bad movie. There is no questioning that. However, if you are in the right mindset, it's still incredibly watchable as a so-bad-its-good hot mess."
rotten,"The crux of it is this; Venom's strength lies in its ridiculousness, because that's all it really has going for it."
rotten,"Michelle Williams, near the very end, [says what] feels like the most sincere heartfelt thing anyone says in the entire movie: ""I'm sorry about Venom."""
fresh,What works in this movie's favor is a tone that makes it feel less like a response to the Marvel Cinematic Universe than an escapee from the Troma Pictures vaults that somehow managed to evade release for the last quarter century.
rotten,A desperately confused piece of work which has only a few compensatory pleasures to offer along the way.
rotten,"[Sony] has a great Venom in Tom Hardy. If only they had a better-equipped director, screenwriters, visual effects, and supporting cast."
fresh,"Venom is a movie that's not without faults. And while the comic book genre is competitive, we can't dismiss that Venom is an enjoyable entry nonetheless."
rotten,"Venom is such a weird movie that never really pulls off what it's aiming for, though it's hard to tell exactly what it's aiming for."
rotten,"Venom may not be a great superhero movie, but it's definitely going to make you laugh."
rotten,"An aggressively mediocre superhero movie, hopscotching through divergent tones that don't fit together."
rotten,"With Venom, there's no love because there's no character to love."
rotten,The inclusion of an admittedly fun pre-end credits teaser only highlights the degree to which Fleischer and company have bungled the premise and title character...
rotten,It's a film that feels more like a buddy sit-com with some weird tonal shifts that just undermine everything happening on the screen. It never quite clicks.
rotten,"Hands-down the worst movie of 2018, so far...movie tickets are so expensive, and I cannot afford to keep watching these terrible movies...this movie didn't even try to have a plot or make sense."
rotten,This didn't wear too well on me...I didn't even realize that.
fresh,"The excessive slow motion underscores how outdated this character is... Still, it is a nice movie. How could it not be, with so many good actors attached? [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"...the result is a weird, atonal, campy mess."
rotten,"After taking their not-so-sweet time getting to the action, director Ruben Fletcher and his screenwriters rush from scene to scene in implausible fashion."
rotten,"Misconceived, miscast and with enough violence and general nastiness to earn it a 15 certificate, it's a remarkably unpleasant way to spend the best part of two hours in a cinema."
rotten,"deeply conflicted, forever torn between being a dark, violent sci-fi horrorshow and a looser, lighter piece of antiheroic pulp comedy"
rotten,"Venom is bad, often boring, and feels like sort of bizarre mix between DC's dark grittiness and Marvel's light, comedy-adjacent style. It's also kind of neither of these things."
fresh,It's a film that simply works with a simple plot and entertains with action scenes and effects. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,An entirely squandered opportunity.
fresh,"It may feel a bit like super hero movies before there were epic sagas, such as the Iron Man and  Captain America franchises, but  Venom  is still a fun time at the movies."
rotten,A waste of a perfectly good Tom Hardy.
fresh,"The story is aided by having top notch acting talent like Hardy and Williams. There is also plenty of action and humor. The formulaic plot has its problems, but overall, this is an entertaining movie."
fresh,Perhaps its worst mistake is categorizing it as a horror film. It has nothing to do with the genre... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"A prefabricated plot with a predictable conclusion, cardboard characters, and an aesthetic devoid of that imagery with which Bergman dressed his stories about the dark contours of belief. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Although it has a strong beginning and a great premise, the truly terrifying part is watching this movie go off the rails. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,A psychological thriller that gets bogged down in its own game. [Full review in Spanish]
fresh,"A theological, philosophical, and metaphysical debate couched in the psychological thriller genre. The world currently needs this debate of atheism vs. a creation featuring a rock-solid moral underpinning that never changes due to human whims."
rotten,"After kicking things off with a pretty solid fake out, the film settles into a repetitive rhythm that quickly becomes tiresome."
fresh,A battle of wits between a psychiatrist and possible demon makes for a tense film.
rotten,"Nefarious has been inaccurately described as a horror movie. It's a poorly made psychological drama about a death row inmate, with no real scares and too much over-acting. As this dull movie drones on, it becomes preachy propaganda for right-wing beliefs."
rotten,"Nefarious advertises itself as a possession thriller but pulls a bait & switch to deliver a Christian and Conservative propaganda piece. Flanery does his best to elevate what is otherwise a 90 minute sermon on abortion, euthanasia, and the death penalty."
fresh,"On the whole, the script, the ­cinematography, and the acting are all well done—but the ending falls apart with a clichéd climax to the action and an injudicious epilogue."
rotten,"If you like your demons on the preachy side, then you may enjoy [this movie]. The rest of us will find [it]...tedious, heavy-handed and indoctrinating."
rotten,The film's heavy-handed and bogus message tells us that Hollywood is immoral because it acts to corrupt its viewer's minds.
fresh,"Aside from a few questionable decisions, Nefarious is interesting enough to give it a watch. Just leave prejudice behind and enjoy the possession take they're going for."
rotten,The only thing not covered in this Christo-fascist manifesto of a movie is “guns.”
rotten,"Well-acted and with decent production values, this faith-based thriller unfortunately gets stuck in its two-person back-and-forth sermoning, making it all too obvious what the outcome will be."
rotten,"While there are moments of intensity in Nefarious, there isn't a moment in the film that feels like cinematic horror unless you're talking about one of those evangelical haunted houses where demons pop out of the walls to warn of the evils of the world."
rotten,"Nefarious builds to a howler of a climax that delivers exactly what you’d anticipate from the makers of God’s Not Dead, just in an even more preposterous way. The big scene would be perfect for an Airplane!-style spoof of evangelical-themed films."
fresh,Character-based thriller uses spare setting for big-time chills sans gore.
fresh,"Nefarious may not be great filmmaking, but it is confident filmmaking, and sometimes that can get you exactly where you want to go."
rotten,Subtlety is not the film’s strong point. Neither is casting.
rotten,[T]he storytelling ... [is] sacrificed at the altar of messaging.
rotten,"Though director Catherine Hardwicke’s movie shouldn’t be labeled unsuccessful, it’s certainly uneven."
fresh,The sequels became increasingly silly and overwrought but the original Twilight (2008) is actually kind of interesting even if you are not a devotee of the fan fic-turned-bestseller series.
rotten,"As someone who has loved the horror genre my whole life, Twilight pains me."
fresh,"The first film grounds everything, and does a fine job of world-building; even the climactic fight scene is fully integrated into the emotional core[.]"
rotten,The fact that it's not completely appalling is perhaps its greatest achievement.
rotten,It's critic proof.
fresh,"For hopeful adolescents and hopeless romantics alike, this bizarrely quaint love story (adapted from the first of a best-selling series of books by Stephenie Meyer) will play the heartstrings like a harp."
fresh,It's a recognizable coming of age story with a fiendish twist.
rotten,"Anyone who has not read the book may find themselves bewildered, or at least a little confused, without some of the nuances of the book to fill it out."
rotten,"Like most great psychological lessons in the hands of novices, this is a story far more interested in dancing to rhythms than understanding melody."
fresh,"Ten years after its release, Twilight stands as a powerful, darkly stylish depiction of teen female desire."
fresh,"Twilight is an earnest fantasy set on the cusp of adulthood, just as the way the light falls on everything in your life is changing. I don't blame anyone who wants to linger there for a moment. Even with sparkle vampires."
rotten,"The orthodox blood-drinking vampires...are about as frightening as snitty runway models, and are only there to threaten Bella's maidenly Type O so Edward can rescue her for the seven-hundredth time."
rotten,"Die-hard fans of the vampire romance novel Twilight will be happy to know that the film follows the book nearly to the letter. For everyone else, however, this isn't good news."
fresh,"In accordance with the adage about the rubbishy book making for the better movie, Twilight the film is great."
fresh,"Without descending into camp, Pattinson undercuts earnest intensity with a deft, self-conscious wit."
fresh,Stewart and Pattinson have convincing chemistry as the star-crossed lovers.
rotten,You've been warned.
rotten,"Unless you're a 14-year-old girl who gets all giddy at the thought of cute boys and first love, steer clear of Thirteen director Catherine Hardwicke's anemic adaptation."
fresh,"Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise."
fresh,It's not the stunts and derring-do which excite the senses as much as the quiet chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson; that is guaranteed to get your blood up.
rotten,My hope is that the sequels are actual attempts at movies. The world doesn't need any more toothless cinema.
rotten,"A deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance for the hot-not-to-trot abstinence set."
rotten,"I've had mosquito bites that were more passionate than this undead, unrequited, and altogether unfun pseudo-romantic riff on Romeo and Juliet."
fresh,Its built-in fanbase (thanks to the best-selling novel) is ready to swoon. I'm not one of those swooners but even I had a great time indulging in the earnest urgency.
rotten,"Twilight really does have an infatuation with surface beauty, especially where the vampires are concerned. In fact they sum up the film pretty well. It's a façade, an appealing one to people who share the right appetites, but that's all."
fresh,"Cinema.com: A densely erotic, twisted take on teen screen romance, Twilight zones out beneath the crushing weight of underage lust intensified and complicated by the excruciating abstention here of unorthodox vampire appetites."
fresh,...the film has been infused with a deliberate pace that proves instrumental in establishing (and perpetuating) the source material's very specific atmosphere.
fresh,"Romantic, smart, likable and often quite funny, without any tacked-on snarkiness or desperate hipness."
fresh,"Mostly elegantly put together, though anything having to do with the pack of bad vampires is disastrous..."
fresh,"It's hard not to get sucked in--if one can get past the sometimes hokey, melodramatic teenage dialogue."
rotten,Suggests Anne Rice slumming for a WB special
rotten,"For a piece about forbidden lust/love, it's not very tortured."
rotten,So this is what all the fuss is about?
fresh,The genre has certainly come a long way from I Was a Teenage Werewolf.
fresh,"A densely erotic, twisted take on teen screen romance and underage rebel lust. And while not exactly the sexually suggestive The Man Who Came For Dinner, Twilight zones out on a defiant inter-species dating fantasy, Close Encounters Of The Thirst Kind."
rotten,"Twilight is pure fantasy, emphasis on the pure... it's a soft-focus reverie for girls who want to be Disney princesses and have their bad boys, too, as long as the bad boys are models of tormented self-restraint."
rotten,"As lovers, these two are not convincing. They don't produce enough of a spark to set off gasoline vapor."
rotten,"This movie will end up being the first kiss for countless twelve-year old boys, but most of them won't look back on the film itself as anything special, which is sad."
rotten,Una película mediocre para una novela mediocre.
rotten,"Bella, a fairly unlikable young woman with a glum expression, has ""put a smell"" on Edward, a ruby red-lipped Nosferatu. It's a tedious stare-down. Bring a thermos of espresso. And an alarm clock."
fresh,I'm glad it wasn't that bad.
fresh,Twilight is a must see and a must for a sequel. Can anyone say New Moon 2010?
rotten,Hardwicke runs into trouble when it comes to actual business of the undead.
rotten,Dumbest vampire movie...ever.
fresh,"Vampires and romance are nothing new, but Twilight gives them enough of a twist to make it interesting and the film delivers enough on that twist to make it far better than its outlying plot makes it sound."
fresh,"I watched Twilight in a cinema full of young girls who, when they weren't texting friends and guzzling soft drinks, giggled, sighed and exhaled with a passion that was not only endearing, but a measure of its emotional truth."
fresh,"A sometimes girlie swirl of obsession that will delight fans, this faithful adaptation is after teenage blood, and will most likely hit a box office artery."
rotten,"If you're a fan of the book, I'm so sorry."
rotten,"In a film of this kind a great deal depends on the chemistry between the lead actors, and here Twilight falls especially short."
fresh,"It's actually very well done, isn't it?"
fresh,"Some will find it all too polite, but compared to rival blockbuster exercises in explosive CGI mayhem, its character-based index of longing and protectiveness at least provides a viable alternative moodscape."
fresh,"Not quite the solid grounding a major new franchise needs, but a stylish and enjoyable supernatural emo romance."
fresh,The two hormonal teenagers sizzle like sausages in a frying pan. The supernatural stunts don't disappoint. Neither does the deadpan wit.
fresh,"It is, in its unworldly way, sweetly idealistic with a charm all of its own: a teen romance to get your teeth into."
fresh,"Minor grumbles aside, it's a success, albeit one that will doubtless have parents and boyfriends inwardly groaning at the prospect of being coerced into watching it."
fresh,"We've never read the books, we're not a 13-year old girl, and yet we actually quite enjoyed it..."
fresh,"Director Catherine Hardwicke (who made Thirteen) captures perfectly the breathless thrill, fear and fascination of first love."
fresh,It is not all top-notch stuff though. Some of the special effects are plain ropey but luckily the teen romance carries the movie. Naturally room is left at the end for the impending sequel. Something we're sure to get our teeth into...
fresh,This is sexual-Gothic tripe of a high order. I am looking forward to the second instalment.
fresh,"It gets a little silly, at times, particularly in the special-effects department, but Stewart and Pattinson are a quite mesmerising pair, and their twitchy, sidelong glances play out a duet of unspoken yearning that might just get under your skin."
fresh,"Horror fans will find little to sink their teeth into, but it'll get tweenage hearts fluttering like orgasmic bats."
fresh,"Twilight, a fantasy romance involving a self-loathing vampire and his sweet-blooded soul mate, is the kind of movie that gets pop culture addicts excited. Surrender to its daftness and you'll emerge covered in something very like a cold sweat."
fresh,"Destined to be a massive hit with its target audience of teenage girls, Twilight nails its central romance and remains an enjoyably watchable thriller, despite the odd bit of dodgy dialogue and some amusingly rubbish special effects."
fresh,"If you don't think someone can appreciate this first of many installments unless they have read the books, let it be said one time: Bite me."
rotten,"Ao que parece, Bella nunca ouviu falar de Betty Friedan ou mesmo de Simone de Beauvoir. Mas, pensando bem, talvez isto seja apropriado, já que as adolescentes que gritam histericamente ao ver Robert Pattison também não."
fresh,"The essential darkish tone of the movie doesn't entirely cramp out the standard razzle-dazzle of a US high school while its sharp, cool references customise it for lucrative teen hook-ups."
fresh,"I succumbed to the palpable chemistry between the leads, and remembered my own girlish fantasies with something of a head-spinning rush."
fresh,The film's main problems stem from its uneven efforts to marry purple passion with black comedy.
rotten,"No, it's not as bad as you think. It's actually worse."
rotten,The film progresses in a manner that's more comatose than undead.
fresh,A work of surprising precision and restraint from talented filmmaker Catherine Hardwicke.
fresh,You don't have to be a teenage girl to know Robert Pattinson is the sexiest heartthrob to emerge on screen since J.D. jumped on Thelma's bed.
fresh,It's easy to understand how Twilight has become a phenomenon. Superb treatment of Stephenie Meyer's best seller and two compelling lead performances make this Romeo and Juliet vampire saga into an utterly bewitching film
fresh,"Cinematically, it's all over the place, [but] the best thing about this movie [is] the relationships and the characters [are taken seriously]."
fresh,"While better than what is shown in the previews, was this really supposed to look like the pilot for an upcoming show on The CW network?"
rotten,Basically Rebel Without a Cause with fangs -- except no one in it is nearly as talented as James Dean or Natalie Wood was.
rotten,"Zero tension, lame dialogue, a complete lack of chemistry between the main characters who are meant to be madly in love, and a villain who does not surface until the movie's end make Twilight a primo snore-fest to say the least."
rotten,"Is there something darker: an unhealthy fascination with unwholesome relationships and bad boys, perhaps mixed with a Nightingale/Stockholm-syndrome desire to ""save"" them?"
fresh,The chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson provides the proper amount of smoldering desire ...
rotten,"Mix 150-proof Victorian romance with some HP (Harry Potter) sauce, add a dash of Munsters humour. . . . The heroine becomes obsessed with surrender and submission to a man constantly tempted to kill her. That's one sucked-up subtext."
rotten,"The film adaptation of Twilight isn't nearly as bad in its own medium as the source material was, though it's still quite a chore to endure."
rotten,"Like Bella and Edward's love, the movie offers a lot of buildup and not much resolution."
fresh,"Hardwicke understands her teen protagonists, and rather than speak down to them (and, by extension, to the film's youthful viewers), she allows their angst-filled behavior to register as the most important thing in the world."
fresh,"In the final act, an undercooked thriller plot threatens to take over, but is held in check to offer a more resonant kick"
rotten,"If Lord Byron had been the love child of James Van Der Beek and Jack Elam and shopped at Hot Topic, he'd have looked a lot like Edward."
rotten,"Twilight sparkles for its intended audience of indiscriminate adolescent females. However, it will only be deemed as a softened, hackneyed horror show of synthetic affection for the rest of us."
rotten,There's not a single bit of characterization here beyond what the human props were supposed to do on screen...
fresh,Teens will go crazy over this film about star crossed lovers trying to bridge the gap between humans and vampires
rotten,"Twilight is not Bram Stoker's Dracula...because, ew, who'd want a hottie who weakens or combusts in sunlight when he could just, well, sparkle instead?"
fresh,Teen fans will love faithful -- if uneven -- adaptation.
rotten,I think this film is definitely a victim of its own expectations.
rotten,"Unfortunately, it just didn't work."
fresh,A darn good hunk of pop moviemaking.
fresh,"Twilight, the first movie adapted from Stephenie Meyer's series of best-selling teen novels, is going to be a big hit with young girls, and deservedly so -- the picture delivers."
rotten,"I don't know about you, but when I was in high school ""undead"" was what I was lucky to be every day."
fresh,"Twilight the movie is cautious, a sort of Tiger Beat-ified Twin Peaks. In its undercooked way, though, it's enjoyable."
fresh,"With its fascinating combination of forbidden love and a seductive vampire theme, 'Twilight"" may be the beginning of a very successful film franchise."
fresh,Twilight does that thing all great love stories do. It speaks to the heart.
rotten,"Supporters may argue that future installments bring more depth, but soup this thin rarely improves with age."
rotten,The biggest problem with the movie is the way Edward looks. It's hard to take him seriously when he resembles like an emo-Eddie Munster.
fresh,"A gentle, sincere and appealing vampire film."
fresh,"I had all sorts of jokes for the Twilight movie, most of them bad and centering on whether or not the impotent, permanently stuck, 17 year old Vampires were Priests. The movie lacks any real bite, but it does give us a nibble."
fresh,"The door is left open for a second installment. Okay, I'll bite."
rotten,"Surely someone in power must've seen Twilight for the hackneyed and blatant attempt to cash in on the devotion of a diehard following it is and said, 'Boy this is awful, but it doesn't really matter cos it's gonna make bank.'"
rotten,"Sloppy, overheated, sometimes involving, ultimately shallow. Read the book--skip the movie."
rotten,"It would appear that in addition to robbing his brood of their need for blood, Carlisle also removed their balls."
rotten,"It's a well-made but thematically flawed film based on a book that was ingenious in conceit but generically written. The strengths of one are the flaws of the other, and vice versa."
fresh,"Twilight is silly and melodramatic and hard to dislike in much the same way as its target audience, with a distinctly teenage sense of tragedy."
rotten,"A hackneyed jumble of cuts and pastes from the book, blended with second-rate music video bits and third-rate visual effects, and finally undone by the fatal casting of Kristen Stewart as Bella."
rotten,"I think Edward Cullen has Asperger's syndrome... Bella should totally go for Jacob instead, but then he could do way better with any of the townies... Edward looks lame ripping trees out of the ground and jumping around the forest like Tom Cruise on Oprah"
fresh,"Within ten years or so, this film (and its inevitable sequels) will look as outdated and ridiculous as the old Beach Party movies, but that shouldn't stop us from sitting back and enjoying the camp with a quiet chuckle."
rotten,"I'm glad I saw Twilight for one reason: It made the phrase jump the shark obsolete, to be potentially replaced with The vampires are playing baseball."
rotten,It [the book] bored me to tears and sucked the life out of my summer vacation. The movie is much better and gets an above average rating only because it is days shorter.
rotten,"Too much angst and not enough monsters. In short, I like a bit more vampire in my vampire stories."
rotten,"Is it worth seeing? Is it any good? Does it matter what's written or said? The answer is no to all, but it certainly leaves room for improvement."
fresh,"Twilight is the Diet Coke of vampire movies, but central to the film's success is that you believe in the love between Edward and Bella."
fresh,"Not that Twilight's fate hangs on intelligibility. It hangs on fangs that aren't bared, and on a bloodlust that isn't indulged."
fresh,"Twilight is packed with wry, understated humor, and Hardwicke gets lively, authentic performances from her young cast."
fresh,"Twilight works as both love story and vampire story, thanks mainly to the performances of its principals."
rotten,"Snyder’s weakest DCEU film was by far Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, an overwrought attempt to shoehorn Ben Affleck’s Batman into the Superman story Snyder started with Man of Steel."
fresh,"I had no problem following the story, understanding the motivations, or investing in the characters. I love that these heroes aren’t copy and pasted from past films. I had no problems with it being dark, serious, and humorless."
rotten,"I want to see a great film about Batman fighting Superman, and I want to see a great film about the Justice League. Regrettably, this scattered, ambitious effort sets out to achieve too much and doesn't accomplish enough."
fresh,"Sometimes it sins with its expository dialogues, some themes are halfway to develop, it can be a little slow... but none of these failures transform it into the misfortune that the critics have been commissioned to sell [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The leads embody their characters despite creative shortcomings, and could hold up a strong Justice League if the franchise is given some new directorial talent..."
fresh,Maybe the film industry is tapping into our culture's difficulty with intelligent and mature conflict resolution...
rotten,Unsatisfyingly curious.
fresh,"Batman v Superman is almost unrelentingly dark, making the two-and-a-half hour movie tougher to get through than the lighter-toned Marvel movies. But it earns its superhero stripes thanks to great performances and some truly knockout action scenes."
rotten,"At 2 hours and 33 minutes in length, the plot has some clear pacing issues. Too many ideas, whilst not enough happening."
rotten,"Anticipated for decades, the grand punch-up between Superman, last son of Krypton, and Batman, lost son of Gotham, arrives not with great fanfare but with a big raspberry."
fresh,"Altogether this is not a great film. It would not be incorrect to consider it a poor one. It is a poor film, however, with outstanding pieces in it."
fresh,"Action-packed and epic, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice delivers an unmissable fight between its title characters, and successfully deepens the mythology of the DC Universe as only Zack Snyder can."
rotten,"Let's not make any bones about it - on any scale, Dawn of Justice is painful to watch."
rotten,"There was a time when superhero movies were fun, escapist entertainment. But now our caped and cowled heroes are as dark and troubled as a reject from a Kafka novel which, in this case, makes for a rather loud but dreary night at the movies."
rotten,It would be nice if there was a moment of dialogue that allowed us to care about the heroes we look up to on the big screen.
rotten,It's bad enough that a single movie isn't big enough for both Batman and Superman; it's even worse that they must share the screen with Wonder Woman and several new villains.
fresh,Cinematography and editing were good. The CGI effects were not overly-done or poorly-executed and that was all this movie needed to be as entertaining and exciting as it was.
fresh,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is kind of wonderful in a steampunk meets industrial punk sort of way.
fresh,The ultimate edition is a superior version to the theatrical cut and certainly has restored my faith in the franchise.
rotten,"This was a violent, miserable experience that only got worse the further it went."
rotten,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice wants so badly to be an operatic modern mythological tale, but it mistakes great length for epic stature."
rotten,"Just like Man of Steel, there are some good things within this over-bloated monstrosity of a movie, but they can't come together to equal a great movie."
rotten,"If I had known that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is a trailer over two and a half hours long, I would save myself the trip to the movies by repeating the three minute trailer on YouTube. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,It wasn't good.
rotten,"This movie was awful... It was so confusing, it was so boring, it was so long."
fresh,"In closing, BvS is a big, bold experiment made by people who really care."
rotten,Batman and Superman are supposed to be two very different characters... [But] this isn't Batman v Superman. It's Batman v Batman.
fresh,"While Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is congested in its first two acts, it compels through masterful action sequences and a brilliant new take on the Caped Crusader."
fresh,"Exceedingly uneven, alternately exasperating and exhilarating, confounding and compelling."
fresh,It's great fantasy entertainment.
fresh,Keep your expectations well in check and you might find yourself enjoying this.
fresh,"...it doesn't stick the landing, but no tentpole blockbuster has ever flown so close to the sun while obscuring that light under layers and layers of gray."
rotten,"Some diehard DC comic fans will try to do mental gymnastics to describe the crap biscuit they were just force-fed as delicious. They shouldn't. They should demand better. And ""better"" than this shouldn't be hard."
rotten,"Don't bother with this one. The acting is sub par & the CGI is hard to look at. Superman was the only saving grace but still not worth watching, unless you need help sleeping."
rotten,"Wondering how to teach your offspring that the world is a horrifying, random, awful place? Let director Zack Snyder take care of that for you."
rotten,Lex Luthor's plan has so many plot holes as well as the script as a whole.
fresh,"Dawn of Justice is perhaps not the Batman/Superman film we deserve, but it's the one we have right now. This chapter has just enough spark to light the universe fuse."
fresh,Zack Snyder has directed both films and has successfully delivered a rich and cohesive cinematic world in which to set his growing cast of superheroes and villains.
fresh,Batman v Superman is a great film and a spectacle that marks a new era for superheroes. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"One big, beautiful mess. This film is screaming with so much potential but, for the most part, it fails to capture that potential at every single turn."
rotten,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is dark and dour through and through.
fresh,"Director Zack Snyder and four screenwriters, including David S. Goyer, opt for a darker tone than audiences are accustomed to in Superman films. This time it works, however, with the inclusion of Batman giving it a grittier edge."
rotten,There's a whole subplot (...) about the world trying to decide how it feels about Superman (...) and it's so important that it's dropped about an hour into the movie.
rotten,...akin to a Philosophy 101 thesis read aloud while you're being punched repeatedly in the face.
rotten,Snyder debe entender que algo oscuro no es precisamente realista.
rotten,"Where BvS largely succeeds as a visual feast of imagery and action spectacle, it fails in creating an emotional backdrop for its gods to resonate with us mortals."
rotten,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice suffers from being both highly derivative and uninspired at the same time
fresh,"Snyder's Superman is the most universally relatable version of the character yet and the social, political and cultural significance of BvS will be appreciated over time"
rotten,BVS's most pivotal scene centers around a jar of urine. I'm not kidding.
rotten,"""There's very little room to breathe in Synder's world, one that appears permanently stained with an oppressively ashen color palette."""
rotten,"Snyder's big-budgeted connect-the-dots comic book caper feel so incoherently stiff and aimless. Humorless and hackneyed, Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice will probably satisfy indiscriminate devoted fans that will buy into the proposed heralded rivalry"
rotten,A mega-budgeted mess of a movie that betrays all the telltale signs of a studio at war with itself.
fresh,Zack Snyder ends decades of anticipation and finally brings both Batman and Superman together for the first time on the big screen with Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice.
rotten,"[An] ungainly, dreary, feature-length trailer for the DC Cinematic Universe that confuses quantity with quality and volume for depth."
fresh,"It's difficult to not feel like a lot of ""Batman v Superman"" is an exhaustive - and expensive- effort from DC and Warner Bros. to catch up to Disney and Marvel's well-oiled cinematic universe."
rotten,"As a comic book fan myself, ""Batman v Superman"" has its moments, but is underwhelming as a film and lacks any fully realized characters."
rotten,An incoherent mess with unnecessary prolonged sequences that just extends the time limit
rotten,"BvS strains so hard for relevance that it forgets superheroes are to the adult world what Buffy was to high school: a series of choices and difficult events, elevated to a mythic level of high stakes."
rotten,"The result of its prolonged and ridiculous premise, over-use of CGI and explosions and lack of any interesting characters? Boredom."
fresh,"Say what you will about this cluttered, densely plotted do gooder yarn; it sure doesn't play like escapism."
fresh,"If you like Batman v. Superman already, then you'll definitely enjoy the ultimate cut."
rotten,A pretty hollow movie that wants to be more than just a superhero movie and showcase its characters because they are the most popular comic book characters of all time.
fresh,"The results are shocking, at times borderline sadistic but effective. Like the musical score, which resembles a chorus of anvils, Batman v Superman pummels the audience into submission."
rotten,"WHen this movie is good, it is really, really good...but man, when it is not? Brace yourself. This movie suffers from fighting with itself for screen time."
rotten,"It wants us to believe it's trafficking in topical notions of politics, religion, and moral ambiguity, but its main currency is our contemporary penchant for hip and affected pessimism."
rotten,"Zack Snyder doubles down on the killing and the brooding in Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, a sequel to 2013's polarizing Man of Steel, and a disappointing film from start to finish."
rotten,"It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it was pretty bad."
rotten,"The movie is a colossal letdown on almost every front, but in some ways, it was to be expected considering the magnitude of what DC and Warner Bros. wanted to accomplish only two films into their shared universe"
rotten,"Zack Snyder is not a subtle director. An understatement, I know. But it's more obvious than ever here."
rotten,"As the pair pound away at each other, it's the hapless viewer who's left begging for mercy, battered into submission by Snyder's overbearing direction and Hans Zimmer's bombastic score."
rotten,"By the time Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice concludes, don't be surprised if you're cranky and exhausted from its hectic, tumultuous conclusion."
rotten,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is recommended only so you can end the almost three-year long wait to find out what happens in the epic collision, but unfortunately for nothing more than that."
fresh,"It flits to and fro between them, often at dizzying speed, in a way that for a long time is quite enjoyable and yet always carried the danger that my head might explode. Batman... Superman... Batman... Superman... Lex Luthor!"
rotten,Batman v Superman is not the franchise jump-starter anyone wanted. It's poison in the Justice League well.
fresh,"Go for the Affleck, stay for the Gadot."
rotten,"It's exactly what you're expecting, but longer, louder, and with an almost unfathomable amount of digitally created violence."
rotten,"At two-and-a-half hours, the film features Wayne and Kent mostly glowering at each other at swanky high-rise parties as the rabble teems below."
rotten,"It is without question an important film today, and a quintessential product of the America we inhabit."
rotten,"Ultimately, Batman v. Superman is a film with no real reason for being, other than to usher in the next round of DC Universe films, and to provide a bunch of explosions."
rotten,"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is such a bleak, disorienting and incoherent mess that despite the few promising moments that sporadically appear, it's nearly impossible to enjoy."
fresh,"There is much to claw through here, so much so that the audience might easily find themselves exhausted from the overall aggression of the film. However, a lot of the story does work. The action is good, and the emotion feels real most of the time."
rotten,"Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice is not so much a movie as it is an extended warning: You comic book movie fans better like this, because there's going to be a hell of a lot more where this came from."
rotten,The script BvS is guaranteed to make people stop complaining about the sloppiness of the third act of Spectre.
fresh,"Snyder knows how to paint a picture but perhaps needs to stay away from the writing process. Watch the Ultimate Edition when you can, and see if it changes how you feel about the movie. It sure did me."
rotten,It seems amazing that something as idiotic as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice could now even get beyond the pitching stage.
rotten,This film isn't as bad as the initial backlash would imply but nor is it anywhere near as good as its own hype promised.
rotten,"Remember when comic book movies were fun? Well, you'll have to use your memory because there's not much fun to be found in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
rotten,"By the end of the film's near-unwatchable final battle, any hope of nuance or intentional subtext had been snuffed out by hours of ugly CGI and pulverized debris."
rotten,The movie is too long. Too much story contains too little humanity or drama. Too many things happen far too often for the really big things to register with an audience when they're filing out of the theater.
rotten,"For all the film's noise, and thrumming violence, it's pretty hard to care very much about either principal hero."
rotten,"As this uneven film grinds to an end, it sets itself up for more shenanigans in more episodes with more super heroes."
fresh,"Snyder has brought a different edge to the superhero genre, one that questions what drives these men of steel and creatures of the night to do what they do and believe what they believe. There is something to admire in that."
rotten,"While not the worst superhero comic book adventure ever to grace the multiplex, it's likely the most frustratingly disappointing."
rotten,"Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice pits the two titans against each other with beautiful visuals, too many characters, and a borderline nonsensical plot."
rotten,The smartest thing about Zach Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) is its revisionist take on the destruction that concluded his Superman reboot Man of Steel.
rotten,"The superhero world needed better storytelling, a comic touch and more than a few rays of sunshine. The story is crippled by special effects from start to finish."
rotten,"Wildly overstuffed and oddly slapdash, filled with characters and sequences that serve little purpose other than to set up a 'cinematic universe.'"
fresh,"It wants to be a lot of things, and it keeps on falling short; but it's not afraid to go Very Big in its attempts to return to the idea of superheroes as modern mythology."
rotten,"I wish I could tell you more, but honestly it's all just a blur of pretentious speeches about what lurks in the hearts of men and noisy fight scenes and nonsensical dream sequences."
rotten,"Snyder's gone all drab and dire, determined to lay siege to our senses (and plot). There's so much glowering, gloominess and good-ness talk that it's hard to imagine the sun, or justice, ever dawning for this disastrous cavalcade of dreary characters."
rotten,"All of the uber-muscled, color-drained visual and aural bombast in the world can't hide the ugly truth about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It's dumb as bricks."
rotten,A movie that beats you into submission and makes you wonder if the sun will ever come out again.
rotten,"It's hard to imagine a big-budget film worse than Avengers Age of Ultron or even Gods of Egypt - there, it's been said - but Batman vs Superman has the dubious distinction of showing utter contempt for its audience and wearing that contempt on its sleeve."
rotten,"Again a studio stands on the precipice of a layered marketing plan, and again the movie its sky castle is built on is every bit as hollow and empty-headed as an action figure."
rotten,"I have a long list of things that made me very angry about Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice, which in no particular order looks something like this : Superman's character behaving like a petulant teenager... The anticlimactic climactic moment."
fresh,Batman v Superman is a step forward for the studio and it promises great things to come from DC. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The conflict between the title characters is really, really hard to buy into and the screenplay drags it out as long as possible."
rotten,"Over two-and-a-half hours, it stumbles its way through what feels like at least three different movies with clumsy tonal shifts and an entirely confused, barely-existent plot."
rotten,"In the end, fear and insecurity impeded a new superhero cinema to be born. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,The film is not as unfortunate as some say and is not as bright as others would. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Warner Bros. needs their piece of the superhero movie cake and the only way they seemed to think they could get it it with a movie stuffed with famous characters even if the story can barely hold itself. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Batman v Superman could have been better, with a more centered script and more elaborated characters, but this is all we have. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It is too much, and it is not enough. In short: Nobody wins."
rotten,As self-important as it is tedious...
rotten,"The plot is absurd, its soundtrack exaggerated and the overall presentation is saturated with effects. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The conflict between heroes is too thin and is never explored and doesn't come to a satisfactory ending. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,All this gloom and doom is just the pits.
rotten,"If a filmmaker attempted to combine everything casual moviegoers don't like about superhero franchises, they couldn't come up with a picture as execrable as this one."
rotten,A momentum-less ode to uncreative people everywhere that torches two of pop culture's greatest characters and uses their ashes as a urinal cake.
fresh,You take the good. You take the bad. You take them both and there you have a Zack Snyder film. It's par for the course for anyone who's followed his films. A little pleasantry and a little frustration mixed together.
rotten,The corporate pimping is actually far more offensive than the scatological humor.
fresh,"The juvenile nastiness can be pretty darn funny when it clicks, but the fact that you actually feel for any of these characters is a testament to the attempt to tell a meaningful story."
rotten,"While Eight Crazy Nights might not quite be the ""nauseating concoction"" that Rotten Tomatoes describes it to be, admittedly the film is rather poor overall."
rotten,"There aren't enough creative Yiddish insults in the world to adequately express how much I hate Adam Sandler's ""Eight Crazy Nights."""
rotten,Eight Crazy Nights is ... a fable of redemption that paradoxically confirms the protagonist in his degradation.
rotten,Ouch. Lame Sandler attempt at holiday humor.
rotten,A nearly unwatchable waste of time...
rotten,
rotten,"Sentimentality and secretions, with a generous helping of blatant product placement, do not make for the most graceful of holiday entertainments."
rotten,"Adam Sandler's goal may have been to provide a holiday movie with Chanukah as the central celebration, but it's not suitable for children and not entertaining to most adults."
rotten,[T]he movie is like a snotty little kid who thinks he can shock you with all the naughty words he knows...
rotten,... a story whose cleverness and meaning is sullied among horseplay we can't take the kids to see.
rotten,"It's about time that all the Christmas movies out there were balanced with a decent Hannukah movie. Sadly, this isn't it."
rotten,...ideal for Adam Sandler fans who were confused by Punch-Drunk Love.
fresh,"Only in the world of Adam Sandler could an animated message of inter-faith holiday appreciation be mixed in with a sextet of defecating deer, a woman with three breasts and songs about hatred and drinking."
rotten,"Small-town goofballs, bizarre musical numbers and plenty of toilet humor -- ah, the holidays are here again."
rotten,it's got all the warmth and charm of the Bataan Death March
rotten,Don't let your festive spirit go this far.
rotten,"This movie's gotta be the result of some pot-induced wager between Adam Sandler and his nattering cronies: ""Hey guys, I'm like a $20 million movie star! How freakin' FUNNY is that? I bet I can make ANY movie I want!"""
rotten,
rotten,The only real achievement that a movie as puerile and moronic as Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights can claim is that it risks giving both Christmas movies and animation a bad name.
fresh,"Nothing but side-splitting, richly coloured, instant classic laughs -- all with the typical Sandler touch."
rotten,Quite the worst animated movie of the year...
rotten,"Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike, Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire."
rotten,"Unlike Trey Parker, Sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny, not actually exploiting it yourself."
rotten,"I'd prefer to think of Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love, the one good movie of the three he did this year."
fresh,"Sandler is at his best as a rage-filled jerk, and at his worst as two of the most irritating characters in all of cartoondom."
rotten,There's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career.
rotten,An earnest Scrooge story with a heart covered in excrement.
rotten,Squanders the cross-cultural comedy potential of a Jewish-themed Christmas movie on cheap fart gags and boilerplate schmaltz.
rotten,"One would think an animated Sandler would be less repellant than live action -- at least you wouldn't have to actually 'see' him -- but surprise! Even (cheaply) drawn, he's actually more unbearable."
rotten,"Eight Crazy Nights is a shallow, crude, mean-spirited and painfully unfunny excursion into lunacy..."
rotten,"An excessively gross, dull film ... lacking originality or wit."
fresh,"Got a lot of holiday spirit, and a lot of laughs."
rotten,"It ain't funny, it ain't good, and it ain't a step in the right direction for co-writer and star Sandler."
rotten,Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie.
fresh,"Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights"" is a crass, crude holiday stocking filled with disgustingly inappropriate humor."
rotten,"Almost as offensive as ""Freddy Got Fingered."""
rotten,"When all is said and done, [it] could have afforded another rewrite and a willingness to avoid pandering to the MPAA ratings board."
rotten,"Sandler is remaining true to his own traditions, although it remains to be seen whether anyone will thank him for that once they've seen the movie."
rotten,The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork.
rotten,"It leaves no bodily fluid unexpressed, no heartstring unplucked."
rotten,"Irritating, boring, gross, silly."
rotten,"Do not, under any circumstances, consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor."
rotten,The animation is rudimentary and imagination virtually absent.
rotten,"Without question, it is not the major Hanukkah family classic just waiting to be made."
rotten,An abomination so horrendously bad that it defies description.
rotten,"It's definitely not made for kids or their parents, for that matter, and I think even fans of Sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting."
rotten,[T]hat fluttering sound you hear [is] just the critics' goodwill Sandler earned from Punch-Drunk Love flying out the window.
rotten,Too childish to be enjoyed by adults and too nasty to be enjoyed by the toddlers.
rotten,"Every bit as violent, profane, mean-spirited and artificially sentimental as any live-action Adam Sandler movie."
rotten,"Here's to hoping we never have to spend a 9th crazy night with Whitey, Davey, and the whole crappy gang."
rotten,A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401(k) statement.
rotten,"It didn't warm my heart, but it sure did give me a headache. What a horrible, horrible film."
rotten,Where Sandler's career is going is anybody's guess.
rotten,"If a lump of coal was once the symbol of a worthless holiday gift, it's now a ticket to Eight Crazy Nights."
rotten,It leaves a far worse taste in your mouth than that old holiday fruitcake in your freezer.
rotten,The problem with all of this: It's not really funny.
rotten,A sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer.
rotten,"I could never figure out why this crude, asinine film was made in the first place."
rotten,"Schmaltzy and unfunny, Adam Sandler's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad, Little Nicky bad, 10 Worst List bad."
fresh,Priceless.
rotten,Isn't appropriate for any innocent child.
rotten,Was Punch-Drunk Love only a dream?
rotten,May puzzle his most ardent fans.
rotten,Adam Sandler's 8 Crazy Nights is 75 wasted minutes of Sandler as the voice-over hero in Columbia Pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie.
fresh,"An offbeat, sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays."
rotten,"All this is rendered with pedestrian animation, deadly dialogue, and a general air of indifference, as if the whole thing was the result of a late-night bet, or a joke gone horribly wrong."
rotten,"Beyond the standard Christmas Carol plot of a bad guy seeing the error of his ways, the rest of the story is quite lame and uninspired."
rotten,You've never seen a movie go from awwwww to ewwwww so fast.
rotten,Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights grows on you -- like a rash.
rotten,One lousy movie.
rotten,"Sets animation back 30 years, musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50."
rotten,Animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots.
rotten,"There are a handful of genuinely comical moments in Eight Crazy Nights, but the whole thing reeks of a super-indulgent, cobbled-together vanity trip by a star whose ego obviously leads him to believe he can put anything on screen."
rotten,"There are a few clever moments in Eight Crazy Nights, but they come after long stretches of repetitive, juvenile gags that can be found in most of Sandler's other films."
fresh,Eight Crazy Nights is a showcase for Sandler's many talents.
rotten,You get the sense that Sandler & Co. did not try hard enough to imbue Eight Crazy Nights with any real depth.
rotten,"If the traditional two-dimensional, cel-painted format of animation really is dying, it's because of films like Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights."
rotten,"If there was ever a movie where the upbeat ending feels like a copout, this is the one."
rotten,Goes on and on to the point of nausea.
fresh,A little gem of animated lunacy that shows the comedian getting back to his roots.
fresh,"One of the oddest animated holiday films you'll ever see, 8 Crazy Nights is also probably the funniest."
rotten,There are good movies and there are bad movies. And then there are movies that make us tired.
rotten,The innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be.
rotten,The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra.
rotten,"If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift, somebody unwrapped it early, took out all the good stuff, and left behind the crap (literally)."
fresh,"The most stirring holiday film since Prancer, and the best animated musical since South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut."
rotten,"Nights is festooned with yards of gross-out jokes, sniggering allusions and, astonishingly, a sentimental climax that's more repellent than any of the crude effluvia the film is drenched with."
rotten,Don't waste your money on a movie ticket. Buy the soundtrack album instead.
fresh,"On the whole, this lively, bittersweet Columbia release works well and is sure to connect strongly with fans of Sandler at his most free-wheeling and uninhibited."
rotten,The only time 8 Crazy Nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers.
rotten,There is something poignant about being 'the only kid in town without a Christmas tree.' Too bad you have to dig through so much stinky stuff to get to it.
rotten,The most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog Rover Dangerfield.
rotten,"Stale first act, Scrooge story, blatant product placement, some very good comedic songs, strong finish, dumb fart jokes."
rotten,"Sandler has made a career of playing tactless, ne'er-do-well morons, but never an animated one."
rotten,An unfortunate return to form for Adam Sandler
rotten,"Adam Sandler's heart may be in the right place, but he needs to pull his head out of his butt"
rotten,"An unholy union between saccharine holiday sentiment, gross-out comedy, and fourth-rate animation."
fresh,"If you're burnt out on It's a Wonderful Life marathons and bored with A Christmas Carol, it might just be the movie you're looking for. It depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept."
rotten,"Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13, yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park, this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults."
rotten,"Who is this movie for? Not kids, who don't need the lesson in repugnance. It's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy.'"
rotten,Sandler's Chanukah song has more laughs in its 3 minutes than 8 Crazy Nights has in the 75 or so torturous minutes that it runs.
rotten,An astonishingly tasteless combination of gross sentimentality and simple grossness.
rotten,"This is foul-mouthed, gross, and about as relevant to either Hanukkah or Christmas as hanging a turd on a Christmas tree."
rotten,The songs are rather forgettable and sometimes downright painful.
fresh,"Mostly just undemanding, amusing stupidity, which used to be taken as a mild compliment back when comedy was actually a genre of movie that got made."
rotten,"While you naturally grow a likeness to a film that throws a joke every 30 seconds, it’s a buzzkill that there is hardly anything worth remembering in a film that even has a high-speed car chase in a cemetery."
rotten,"Tyler Spindel may have a contract, work cheap, or is part of the company's inventory, but the truth is he doesn't show a talent that's worthy of the ensemble. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"You might find a few intermittent laughs, but if you have high expectations to laugh your butt off, you’ll probably come away feeling robbed."
rotten,That [Julie Hagerty and Richard Kind] provide a few bright spots of comedic relief in a movie that is supposed to be all comedic relief pretty much sums up The Out-Laws.
rotten,"I aim to be open-minded, so I took a shot at a clever enough idea for a comedy. It didn’t pay off."
rotten,"Had this been given a bit more effort in the script department, The Out-Laws could have been something much better. You will enjoy Brosnan and Barkin and will laugh here and there, but overall this is another lackluster Netflix original."
rotten,...a hit-and-miss comedy that too often emphasizes elements of an egregiously (and gratingly) larger-than-life nature...
fresh,"It's a wonderful cast... I thought this was a lot of fun, and as Netflix productions go this was one of the better ones."
rotten,This snot-filled action comedy boasts humour so puerile it would delight a toddler.
rotten,"Pierce Brosnan and Ellen Barkin have some nice moments together, but this film was a waste of time."
rotten,A little Adam Devine goes a long way. Better a supporting character than a lead.
rotten,"“The Out-Laws” is the kind of throwaway movie that many people use to give streaming comedies a bad name. It’s generic, formulaic, and not nearly as funny as it wants to be."
rotten,"The Out-Laws is a workable piece of entertainment, yet will struggle to be a film audiences remember after its release."
rotten,Good moments from some of the supporting players in this frantically unfunny farce only highlight the inadequacy of the overeager DeVine as a comic leading man.
fresh,"Hit and miss with the broad comedy moments, this is a passable fish-out-of-water light comedy for background noise."
rotten,"Vaguely scripted and ineptly directed, this moronic wannabe comedy is filled with puerile improvisation which is even worse than scripted lines like 'I'm gonna twist you like one of your Go-Gurts and slurp you dry"" and ""License and masturbation please."""
rotten,"The entire movie is a mess that is crude and sadistic toward all of its characters, and ultimately toward the audience."
fresh,"Lashings of satisfying silliness are to be had with The Out-Laws, a daffy caper comedy that presents a very funny twist on the Meet the Parents premise, only here there’s much more shooting and chasing...As a crimedy it hits all the right notes."
rotten,"The punchlines (a Bond quip here, a Shrek joke there) are spectacularly unfunny -- the action sequences are barely coherent."
rotten,"This Happy Madison production has Adam Sandler written all over it -- not a compliment in this case, as the cast of talents and funny premise are undermined by some of the Sandler-style antics."
rotten,"A bizarre combination of Meet the Parents, Baby Driver and Mickey Blue Eyes, this is an adult family comedy light on laughs and bereft of anything compelling to recommend it."
rotten,Filled with too many limp dick jokes.
rotten,"Despite the efforts of these actors, including Adam Devine, Pierce Brosnan, Ellen Barkin, and Nina Dobrev, the film is held back by its weak and uneven storyline."
rotten,"There is virtually nothing original or even clever about the Happy Madison production, The Out-Laws. This comedy about meeting in-laws follows the genre playbook step by step to the letter, so you will know exactly what will happen before it occurs."
rotten,Farce of this magnitude depends on some level of empathy for the protagonist forced to endure this nightmare. While there is certainly none for Adam Devine's idiot there is even less for the audience forced to go along with every mugged-up decision.
fresh,"It’s way too much where just a little would go so much farther. There’s some legit very funny scenes, but they’re weighed down by moments where the filmmakers are desperately trying for laughs instead of just letting them come more naturally."
fresh,"DeVine manages to make unapologetic dweebishness charming, and the movie is elevated by a mish-mash of wonderful character-actor bit parts."
rotten,"Ultimately, “The Out-Laws” feels a little too slapped-together, and it’s hard to give it anything resembling a strong recommendation."
fresh,A silly action comedy that steals a few smiles thanks to Adam DeVine who carries the movie on his shoulders with his charismatic performance... [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The Out-Laws, a diversion at most, is streaming purgatory incarnate. It isn't a movie to be devoured in one viewing, nor necessarily finished at all."
rotten,Everything you need to know about this movie can be gleaned from its title. That's rarely a good sign.
rotten,"You can usually count on Kind or Hagerty to give a great line delivery here or there, and I guess that the case here. Buy beyond that, you’re on your own, film lovers."
rotten,Perhaps one of the few benefits of the pandemic is that this is the sort of movie unlikely to attract theatergoing audiences anymore.
rotten,The buildup is more amusing than the payoff in this freewheeling combination of cringe comedy and heist thriller that rarely rises to the level of its cast.
rotten,Every single minute of The Out-Laws is cranked-up-to-11 irritation
rotten,"Criminally disappointing, at least the actors seem like they may have had a decent time on set. For a supposed comedy it was devoid of laughs."
rotten,I can’t in good conscience recommend wack-ass crap in any form.
rotten,[Tyler Spindel] directs with a professionalism that at times resembles an auto pilot. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"The Out-Laws is generic, rote, predictable, unfunny, and tired."
rotten,"Audiences looking to settle for sheer mayhem will be engaged, but the promising premise doesn’t deliver the level of fun the audience, and this cast, truly deserves."
rotten,"For a Netflix movie that was obviously reverse-engineered from its title, and even more obviously made by the director of The Wrong Missy, Tyler Spindel’s The Out-Laws could be a hell of a lot worse."
rotten,Embarrassed laughter isn’t the same as the other kind; a cringe isn’t the same as a smile. And humiliation -- of an actor as well as a character -- isn’t really funny.
fresh,This tried and tested premise is bolstered by some surprisingly performances from Pierce Brosnan and Ellen Barkin. If only Adam Devine was a match for them in this refreshing twist on Meet the Parents.
rotten,A movie fading from memory faster than I can write about it.
rotten,"A Netflix comedy so crass and witless that it almost deserves to be seen, if only in pursuit of an answer to the age-old question of how films as bad as this get made."
rotten,Both lead actors deserve far better. So does the audience.
rotten,"Even by the already-low standards of the constantly-churning Netflix machine, this movie has almost no redeeming value at all."
rotten,"The dialogue is dreadful, the acting is overly broad and the jokes are juvenile."
rotten,"While the Netflix original film The Out-Laws, starring Pierce Brosnan and Adam Devine, is undoubtedly entertaining, I wouldn’t call it a must-see film either."
rotten,"Frankly, it’s all a bit too much."
rotten,"If this group of people had simply improvised a movie, it would’ve been funnier."
rotten,"The Out-Laws is a ridiculous movie with little saving grace. While the premise had some potential, the execution is awful."
rotten,"Actor turned director Tyler Spindel is another Sandler protege. And as grateful as we are that The Sandman moved on from trying to prop up Nick Swardson, Rob Schneider and David Spade, this Spindel dude is nobody’s idea of the next Penny Marshall."
rotten,"Derivative and desperate and, at the same time, bizarrely pleased with itself."
fresh,There seems little chance Netflix will offer us a comedy in the vein of Ernst Lubitsch or Preston Sturges. So make the most of an entertainment that comes in at the altitude of a better Adam Sandler joint.
rotten,From a sitcom setup about a guy meeting his significant other's parents ... The Out-Laws devolves quickly and increasingly into irritation.
fresh,The Out-Laws is one of my biggest surprises and favorite comedies of the year.
fresh,The Out-Laws is a fun riff on the Meet the Parents concept and lets James Bond's Pierce Brosnan show off his comedy chops.
rotten,"The movie’s lazy conception of career criminals gives The Out-Laws little room to maneuver when it eventually pivots into a wacky heist picture, so it succumbs to action-comedy chaos."
rotten,The wittiest thing about The Out-Laws is its title.
rotten,Going into The Out-Laws with low expectations is probably best because you will come out of it not feeling like you wasted 95 minutes of your day.
rotten,"In so many ways it feels redundant and pushes Netflix further into the twilight zone of straight-to-VOD comedies that has, in recent years, become an obscure purgatory for good actors in bad movies."
fresh,The Out-Laws shines when it spotlights the committed performances of its cast.
rotten,"Rough on the senses, in desperate need of a more imaginative helmer and some sort of writing, as the movie basically wanders from scene to scene, counting on the cast to bring their own ideas to the limp endeavor."
fresh,[A] watchable if forgettable crime comedy...
rotten,"...lazy, formulaic, loud and unfunny."
rotten,"Much of the cast seems to be having fun, but it comes at our expense."
rotten,"With a star cast like this, ‘The Out-Laws’ had a lot of potential, but the film goes through too many lows to balance the highs."
rotten,"It supplies some brazen laughs, but it shouldn’t be a surprise that the crude and dimwitted farce “The Out-Laws” is an Adam Sandler production."
rotten,... The epitome of a straight-to-streaming time-killer.
fresh,"The plot is ludicrous, but this is the sort of film where it’s about hilarious antics not plausibility."
fresh,"A slight comedy, but it’s also raucous and kickily violent, with several laugh-in-spite-of-your-better-judgment bits."
fresh,"Just as he's done in many of his novels, McCarthy's first screenplay follows his stylized, almost mythically cynicism with unwavering detachment and insight."
fresh,"McCarthy is ambitious in his first original screenplay,(...) in the end (...) [it] could even be too verbose for a critical audience."
fresh,Even if it's sometimes bumbling and inexplicable - it's never not totally captivating.
rotten,"Some will find it a head scratcher, others will be drawn into its uncompromising look at life and death, cartel style."
rotten,Anything but subtle - and also not very inventive.
fresh,"It's an imperfectly glorious film that is flawlessly written, impeccably acted, and impossible to forget."
rotten,"The Counselor is chock full of talent...Despite this, the movie ends up leaving the viewer feeling empty. There are some nicely staged scenes, but the script is just full of rambling dialog."
rotten,"You continually feel like right here, this very moment, is where things are going to change, where the film begins living up to its potential. Instead, however, you find yourself waiting for something that never comes."
rotten,Disappointing.
rotten,"The Counselor is a colossal waste of (mostly) talented pretty people, revealed as mere puppets to over baked material, and perhaps evidence that great prose does not always translate into great screenplays."
rotten,"The Counselor is a horrifying reminder that even the best of us are capable of bad, bad things."
rotten,The Counselor has too much dialogue and too many stars all dressed up with nowhere to go.
rotten,It's a convoluted mess that is more dull than intriguing.
fresh,"Undoubtedly a film peppered with flaws that blows hot and cold from one scene to the next, but despite its many bizarre eccentricities, it still manages to hang together -- just."
rotten,"The filmmakers seem to have been going for both, but despite their great cast, the characters aren't allowed sufficient breathing room for us to believe in them enough to care."
rotten,"In any event, for a movie with Oscar potential, I can only describe it as disappointing."
rotten,I get the feeling that everyone involved was too revering of [Cormac] McCarthy's work to change it ...
rotten,"So, Ridley Scott, when your film asked me, in its deepest sincerity: 'Have you been bad?' The answer is yes, Counselor, you sure have."
rotten,"Time and again, I groaned inside at the awkward, writerly dialogue unconvincingly uttered by a talented cast, most of them at a loss to make the dialogue sound like human conversation."
rotten,"Do Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy have teenage sons they want to impress? Is that why they have put together this ludicrous fantasy, almost entirely cobbled together from other, better movies?"
rotten,"Not just boring-boring, but aggressively boring: a film that not so much hates you as dares you to leave."
rotten,"... overall, Ridley Scott's The Counselor is a mess, and falls somewhere on the spectrum between ""not good"" and ""ambitious debacle""."
rotten,It's like watching a movie in another language.
fresh,"A masterful film, one that succeeds in conveying the nature of a cold, uncaring cosmos with remorseless tenacity."
fresh,"For all its perceptible pleasures, one's left to ask how well-served any of its talents were in the first place."
rotten,"With the exception of Bardem's hilarity, Fassbender's plumbing the depths of great grief, and Pitt and Rubén Blade's gangster poetics, the word for the film overall is 'Meh.'"
fresh,"[McCarthy] reminds us (with a particularly American sensibility) that this world is broken and tragic and not fair, and that pushing past that fact too fast is an error we can't afford to make, for the good of our souls."
rotten,"At least Bardem continues to make the case that he doesn't have a bad performance in him, even in a film as lackluster as this."
fresh,"The movie is full of odd one-on-one conversations that may exasperate those who want the film to get to the point, but the dialogue is the point."
rotten,"Despite some lovely exchanges and cracking lines, The Counsellor is too complex and wordy for its own good."
rotten,"McCarthy's script is a huge misfire. Adapt this into a full-fledged novel, where an author can detail a character's history, beats, and motivations, and then you likely have a successful medium."
rotten,"The Counselor is an ugly, ugly picture, even despite its absurdly attractive leads."
rotten,"With moments of true greatness and strong performances, the film still ultimately fails to live up to its potential for surprising reasons, while still being one of this year's most fascinating films to think about and discuss."
fresh,"This isn't a thriller, this is far more than that: it's a journey to a very dark, very real place on Earth."
rotten,"Half navel-gazing and half despair, and both feel like McCarthy's writing hallmarks wrenched tight to the point of self-parody. Even if that's the case, it's only involving in spasms, and the good parts go nowhere he hasn't been before."
fresh,"McCarthy and Scott capitalize their themes: this is The End. This is The End of the Road, the End of Civilization, the End of Capitalism. This isn't neo-noir, it's über-noir."
rotten,I think I liked The Counselor?
fresh,"While it operates in a heightened register, it nevertheless grounds its squalor in the reality of the world."
rotten,"You get the feeling that there's an extremely interesting story unfolding, but we're constantly on the periphery and there's not nearly enough substance to sink your teeth into."
rotten,"The plot is boring, who-cares nonsense. I think it's just unbelievably weird, and not only because Cameron Diaz screws a car."
rotten,"The script, packed with pretentious lines and silly dialogue, manages to dull even the most exciting and provocative parts of this story."
rotten,"Whatever else happens in this movie, the woman who fucks a car is most audacious, most incomprehensible and the most deeply banal emblem, the limit of men's imaginations."
fresh,"It's filthy, nasty, sexy, absurd, appalling, and exhilarating, and it succeeds as a musky union of novelist Cormac McCarthy's bleakness and Ridley Scott's sense of chic."
fresh,A spectacular feeding frenzy
rotten,"Looking at the pedigree of the talent involved, and the oddly subdued damp squib that they eventually turned out, it's a weirdly gratifying task figuring out exactly how it all went wrong."
rotten,Blah bloody blah.
fresh,"With Ridley Scott at the helm and the starriest of A-list casts, The Counsellor may come with lashings of Hollywood gloss, but don't bargain on any Hollywood sugar-coating of McCarthy's customary nihilism."
fresh,"It is well worth seeing. But it is the product of a clash between two very different sensibilities, those of its author, Cormac McCarthy, and its director, Ridley Scott."
rotten,"Despite some lovely exchanges and cracking lines, The Counsellor is too complex and wordy for its own good, so it's Cormac 1, Scott 0."
fresh,"Frustratingly directionless and unconcerned with detail, but fans of the writer will feel right at home wallowing through fresh reams of his trademark bleak prose."
rotten,"It is like watching a group of decent, polite people trying to cope with the arrival of a certifiable lunatic to their hitherto civilised party."
rotten,"Almost, but not quite, hilariously demented - if accidentally so - drama about sex and death, and why not to get involved with drug cartels."
rotten,"The Counsellor is a cold, pessimistic film that feels especially unforgiving. McCarthy's script is far too distanced for its own good and requires more from its audience than it is prepared to give back."
rotten,"The result is so much ponderous dialogue that, peaceable chap though I am, I found myself longing for another merciless act of vengeance."
rotten,All those wasted high-end wardrobes.
fresh,"It aims for the watchability of 'The Big Sleep,' a film so tangled even its author, Raymond Chandler, couldn't explain certain plot mysteries."
rotten,"The narrative pings around as meaninglessly and entertainingly as a pinball machine at first, but the comic timing feels off ..."
rotten,"It's regrettable enough that the film opens with coy pillow talk between the main protagonist and his lover. Even worse is the realisation that this scene is intended as an appetite whetting pre-credits sequence, complete with dramatic score."
rotten,"This film proves that all the right ingredients don't necessarily make a movie work. Even with top-drawer filmmakers and actors, this dramatic thriller simply never grabs our interest."
rotten,"An inert, dispiriting, detached, disjointed, counterfeit and clumsy film ..."
rotten,Disappointing thriller that's let down by an overly-written script that's so in love with its own dialogue that it neglects to provide a coherent or engaging story.
rotten,"As you'd expect from Scott, the action is efficient, clinical and nasty. If only the same could be said of McCarthy's dialogue, which always sounds pretty but too often lapses into profound irrelevance."
rotten,"It's just a very bad idea for a film, proficiently executed."
rotten,This is one review where you don't need to worry about spoilers. I couldn't tell you how it all pans out even if I wanted to.
rotten,What a letdown. 'The Counselor' is a rambling mess with a talented cast that's far superlative to its tedious screenplay.
rotten,"As viscerally promising as the McCarthy-Scott combination initially seemed, the result is nourishing on a purely intellectual level; it works in your head, but you never feel it in your bones."
rotten,"A great writer's pompous idea of pulp fiction, treated with stultifying seriousness by everyone else involved."
rotten,...at least in No Country these conversations ended with a cattle gun to the head.
fresh,"Ridley Scott finally gets to put Cormac McCarthy on the screen. It's no No Country, but despite its less successful elements is shocking, powerful and - this just in - more gorgeously written than any movie you'll see this year."
fresh,"Ridley Scott's latest film is occasionally a little too willfully obscure for its own good, but it still rates as a top-notch and highly original crime thriller."
rotten,The Counselor is a chore of a movie to watch and even the cast's collective talent can't save it from its brain-numbing dialogue.
rotten,"With no apparent interest in restraint, director Ridley Scott provides a glossily sordid scenic tour of the high-end Mexican drug trade...high production values, bloodshed and drug dealing don't add up to much more than an uninvolving time killer."
rotten,A film about a bunch of people you don't like doing things you don't understand for reasons you don't care about.
rotten,To use an old cricketing quip: The Counselor has all the gear but no idea.
fresh,"The go-for-broke bleakness of the whole thing seems to have re-energized Scott, who manages to avoid the dramatic inertia of his recent films."
rotten,"Like Fassbender's counsellor, Scott is playing with dark-hearted individuals of whom he has no real understanding. From the outset, he was on a path to a beating and his audience takes the brunt of it."
fresh,"Yet even if The Counselor fails to live up to its hype, with its snappy dialogue and satisfying action sequences, it is a good bit of naughty fun."
rotten,"Each scene serves as little more than an index card for the mechanistic plot, which Scott films in a glossy and fluid style befitting an industrial promotion for the movie's high-tech weaponry."
rotten,"I got the distinct impression that somewhere, just off screen, the real story was taking place, leaving said screen filled with the asides, the circumlocutions, and the ancillary moments that, while adding color, do nothing to advance the actual story"
rotten,The only thing more shocking than The Counselor's frequent head-poppings and Diaz's acrobatic automobile display is how underwhelming this pedigreed crime thriller truly is.
fresh,"After more than a decade of trying to make camera-shaking, brain-dead action hits, he seems to have returned to his proper place as an arthouse director."
rotten,"Evidently, the film's raison d'etre proves to be its spectacular undoing. McCarthy's script is awful: bogged down with leaden dialogue that prolongs scenes for no reason."
fresh,"Every element of the film is designed for maximum impact, no matter how small its part in the big picture"
fresh,"Intriguing from the get-go, Ridley Scott's superbly directed thriller distinguishes itself by its complex, colourful and mostly bad characters ... Greed and lust are the drivers and it is one hell of a ride"
fresh,"This is one fine neo-noir, expertly directed by Ridley Scott with a host of superlative star turns, and an arresting, challenging screenplay by Cormac McCarthy"
rotten,"... feels more literary than cinematic, with a character-driven approach that requires patience but doesn't always reward it."
fresh,The Counselor delves into the abject amorality of criminality. It's a devastating examination of greed and grief in the overwhelming wilds of apathy; you'll love it if you like that sort of thing.
fresh,"The Counselor plays better when you realize it's Mr. Bean with Michael Fassbender instead of Rowan Atkinson. It's ahead of its time. In 25 years, there's a chance that it may be regarded as a modern classic."
rotten,"Good actors, great director, brilliant writer - how could ""The Counselor"" turn out to be such a boring mess?"
fresh,Bleak Counselor is more Cormac than Ridley
rotten,A Counselor in need of advice
fresh,"A dark, disturbing and stylish thriller that portrays the fatal consequences of greed within a world without grace when dealing with devils who know no boundaries."
fresh,"Dull decadence derby, doomed by decorous debauchery and doltish death-dealing."
rotten,"Sometimes The Counselor suggests Rob Zombie trying to do Samuel Beckett, only with more words."
fresh,"A film that fascinates me in its sheer eccentricity, and eccentricity is not much seen in mainstream film these days -- at least not this extravagantly."
rotten,The Counselor is the cumbersome end product of a high-minded writer trying to slum and a slick director aiming for cosmic depth.
rotten,"As a screenwriter, the 80-year-old [McCarthy] turns out to be a great novelist."
rotten,It's not so much a bad film as it is a disappointing one. A very disappointing one.
rotten,"It's like a mumblecore movie about a bunch of Sarah Lawrence philosophy majors, made by coked-up rich people for 100 bajillion dollars."
rotten,Nothing Makes Sense
rotten,"... an excellent reminder of why even our best novelists should be discouraged from writing for the screen ... a ludicrous, laughably over-the-top attempt to one-up 'No Country for Old Men.'"
fresh,"Stimulating and seductively dark--a smart, challenging neo-noir."
rotten,"Even if the film failed to win me over, this all-star thriller is not a total misfire, if only it were firing more than just impressive looking blanks."
fresh,"Like David Fincher's Se7en, one of this movie's closest spiritual cousins, The Counselor ultimately delivers a diagnosis that tells the awful truth."
fresh,Disappointing.
rotten,"Unfortunately, the first screenplay by Cormac McCarthy tries to spice up a torrid fish-out-of-water crime thriller with cryptic existential literary language (read: pretentious) that is better read than spoken."
rotten,"What went wrong? I am sad to say, the script by Cormac McCarthy. It just doesn't work. And who can even follow this thing? It starts out under the sheets and quite frankly should have stayed there."
rotten,"At its best, this film is reminiscent of the philosophical slant often taken by the Coen brothers. At its worst, it recalls the excesses of latter-day Oliver Stone."
rotten,No complaints about the acting or Ridley Scott's directing and cinematography. They are superb. Cormac McCarthy's writing is not so impressive.
rotten,Fails to generate a feeling that we are seeing something that means much.
rotten,"Bleak and formidable, this brutal, depressing, cautionary tale may be an actor's dream but it's an audience's nightmare: a muddled mess of a movie."
rotten,a bore and a chore
fresh,The Counselor is a novelist-turned-screenwriter experiment likely to be met with mixed reception between the 'get it' and 'don't get it' types in the audience.
rotten,Novelists don't always make good screenwriters-this is the first film for which McCarthy has written the screenplay himself-and The Counselor's nihilism soon becomes tedious.
fresh,"Indulgent, but slick and endlessly quotable."
fresh,"Gripping, violent drama about dangers of the drug trade."
rotten,"Cormac McCarthy's manly grade of nihilism, pseudo-biblical prose and extreme acts of violence fill a plot-driven story that shows startlingly little interest in plot, character development or exposition."
fresh,"In all this philosophizing and frequently excellent dialogue, no one has been able to come up with a good idea on where it should go."
rotten,"The endlessly enigmatic conversations and continual introduction of characters who never get defined for us (let alone fleshed out) finally make the movie arid, repetitive and hollow."
rotten,"The director who made Thelma and Louise and Alien fails to bring any spine to the gelatinous narrative, and as a result, the movie pretty much feels like a puddle of protoplasm without any meaningful form."
rotten,The end product just isn't all that red-hot.
fresh,"I can't say I found the film boring, not for one moment."
rotten,"As a study of a young wife's amours in high and low Bangkok society, Emmanuelle is a fluffy consignment of romantic, slick, soft‐core, sexual simulations that is largely uninspired and hardly a revelation to enthusiasts long exposed to the genre."
rotten,"There is a great deal of hectic coupling in this film, all of it staged with chintzy tastefulness, as if the participants were being arranged for a department-store window display."
rotten,"It's artfully shot by director Just Jaeckin, the Thailand locations are occasionally stunning and Kristel disrobes with some elegance. However, acting is far from her strong suit, and the dialogue and story are pretty banal."
rotten,It's slick and boring and won't offend anyone - unless they care about movies.
rotten,The truth is the film is cheap and vulgar from beginning to end. The only one who stays afloat is its protagonist. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Though it is more historically significant than any other softcore porno ever made, it just isn't that memorable an exploitation film."
fresh,One of the classics of soft-core erotic cinema.
rotten,Film is a series of glossy images and appears more a come-on for the civil service than for femme lib.
rotten,"Very glossy, very French voyage into sexual discovery that mingles cliché and elegant posturing with an attempt to broaden the horizons of the sex film."
fresh,
fresh,"It's a relief, during a time of cynicism in which sex is supposed to sell anything, to find a skin flick that's a lot better than it probably had to be."
rotten,"All in all, a somewhat tedious but occasionally amusing period romp."
fresh,
fresh,First time director Just Jaecklin's film is the movie that set the clichs for the soft core films to follow.
rotten,"The dogs give the film a touch of class, but as a whole this is forgettable."
fresh,"It eventually comes a little unglued, and the ending is silly, but, for a while, inventive filmmaking, a committed lead performance, and harrowing realism make this thriller worth seeing."
fresh,"It’s not art. It’s a movie for a frat-boy weekend night where nobody in the dorm managed to get a date, and so for Frat-house Friday movie-nite, along with abundant pizza and beer -- Muzzle is perfect."
fresh,"Ultimately, it’s a fresh, gritty take on the broken cop and his dog story."
rotten,"Eckhart and the dogs stay watchable, though they often find themselves stymied by a story that proves a more difficult obstacle course than the one challenging K-9 officers."
fresh,Aaron Eckhart shines in sobering look at L.A. crime and the officers who fight it.
rotten,"""Muzzle"" is filled with intriguing aspects not explored meaningfully. There are so many different threads, themes, and plots, even Scotch-taped together in the hopes it will come together. It doesn't."
rotten,"The depressing but captivating setup is wasted to tell a much more generic, routine tale"
rotten,Muzzle doesn't trust a premise so introspective ... so it overwhelms that potential with a convoluted plot that ultimately feels like routine busywork.
rotten,"Lackluster and overwrought while sorely lacking in palpable thrills and suspense. In a double feature with John Wick, it would be the inferior B-movie."
rotten,"It starts off strongly, bogs down in the middle, and is mostly terrible by the end."
rotten,"While it might set itself apart from many superhero movies that came before it, it seems to do so arbitrarily as opposed to exploring those ideas in any organic way."
fresh,"Man of Steel was Snyder’s triumphant debut with Superman, and it’s still a thrilling example of why Clark Kent can be an engaging lead for one of these movies despite the speculation for the opposite."
fresh,Man of Steel is fun and makes a lot of sense a lot of the time but is also dull and senseless some of the time.
fresh,"You finish watching, hoping that better times might just be ahead ..."
rotten,"Snyder’s film is humorless and flavorless, unmemorable and underwhelming, epic-sized but far from grand."
fresh,It’s a movie that offers a unique vision laced with fun summer action while also showing a level of respect for the source material.
rotten,"If there is one word to describe Man of Steel, it would be a disappointment."
fresh,"Here is the main problem: it is a solid movie, but a terrible Superman movie."
fresh,"Man of Steel gets a lot right. The casting of Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark Kent is spot-on. He brings the right notes of heroism and earnestness to the role, as well as embodying the physical presence of the character."
fresh,"While Cavill never really gets a chance to make the film his own, the quality of the performances are enough to salvage the film's many shortcomings."
fresh,A more sincere Clark Kent derivation.
rotten,A reminder that it takes a whole lot more than muscle and strength to make a true superhero.
fresh,"Zack Snyder makes his film feel more human, more emotional and more heroic than any other Superman adaptation on the big screen. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It may not have lived up to the hype, but Man of Steel is still the best modern Superman movie, and well worth checking out even if the screenplay delivers its fair share of disappointments. Still, this feels like a solid opening chapter from Zack Snyder."
rotten,"In this quick fast episode, I go into a bit more on why I dislike the Man of Steel film"
rotten,"A pandering, monotonous mess that features an anachronistic character who may be best left a relic of the past."
fresh,"Man of Steel is admittedly missing humor and fun, consumed by the seriousness of producer Christopher Nolan's dark overtones and grey color palate. But the tone was a course correction, and the payoff is great."
rotten,"It's curious how the abstraction of CGI carnage and the abstraction of plot verbiage seem to go hand in hand. But one thing missing from this resolutely earnest film is humour, which is odd when you consider it's based on a comic book."
fresh,"Arguably the most satisfying, complex, and entertaining feature film ever created featuring the superhero."
fresh,"Henry Cavill breathes new life into the Man of Steel, the most realistic version of Superman we are going to ever get."
fresh,An event movie that is actually an event.
rotten,The scenes between Russell Crowe's Jor-El and Michael Shannon's glassy-eyed Zod crackle with tension and drama that the scenes with Henry Cavill's Superman just can't match.
rotten,Snyder needs to learn the art of subtlety.
rotten,Man of Steel ultimately fails because it forgets its origins. It's a film full of angst and devoid of humor.
fresh,"Man of Steel isn't going to win over those who are indifferent about Superman, but it does set the stage for future films with more interest in character than in spectacle."
rotten,"Shannon is no great shakes as the shouty villain and Adams does little with a thankless role. As for Cavill, he certainly looks the part but lacks crucial charm and charisma, surely the two essential qualities any Man of Steel needs,"
fresh,"Man of Steel is grandeur and epic, but it's also deep and personal."
fresh,This is an origin story that is rooted outside the actions of one-Clark Kent is not really even the central figure molding it.
fresh,The key to great Superman stories is to have ones that give Superman a deep and complex problem that speaks to society at large. Man of Steel successfully reinvented him for the 21st century.
fresh,Man of Steel's schizophrenic structure acts as a microcosm for both the profoundly philosophical and the profoundly thuggish dialectic at the heart of the Superman legend.
rotten,"The ending is particularly ridiculous, with a series of lines that the screenwriters obviously liked but couldn't fit in anywhere else."
fresh,"The movie is stylish, entertaining, suspenseful and spectacular...oh and it's also two hours and 28 minutes long. It would be nice to save the world and get the girl in less than two hours."
fresh,"What's there is good, but needs more built on top of it. Instead, Snyder fills the rest of the runtime with action spectacle."
fresh,Being an alien among humans is scary and director Zack Snyder drives this point home showing the world through a young Kent's eyes.
fresh,"Man of Steel is a slightly flawed and far from perfect modern telling of the Superman myth, but ultimately is a fun and engrossing reinterpretation of the character."
rotten,Beats its bulletproof chest too mightily and too long.
fresh,"Driven by fantastic performances and a confident script, Man of Steel manages to both capture the imagination and ground the character in the modern-day."
rotten,"If superhero movies were once plagued by excessive silliness, Man of Steel suffers from an excess of dignity."
fresh,My honest opinion? I loved this movie.
fresh,The Superman movie I've always wanted to see on the big screen. A brilliant modern take on the iconic hero. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"At first pass it works but upon revisiting it, it just doesn't hold up."
rotten,"This Superman has the rare ability of making us look back fondly on 2006's nostalgic Superman Returns-a film that elicited a nearly universal ""meh."""
rotten,"Too many amazements can lead to audience exhaustion, especially when the film runs more than two hours."
fresh,Man of Steel is the movie of the summer. It's the Superman movie we deserve. And it's about time.
rotten,Snyder is an adrenaline junkie forever jonesing for a fix; he does less building to the action beats than backing each one into the next.
rotten,"A curiously empty exercise in blockbuster filmmaking, Man Of Steel is full of sound and fury signifying... you know what."
fresh,"A hugely impressive and entertaining story of arguably the most powerful character in the superhero pantheon (and also one of the biggest pop culture icons), it's clear that the Man of Steel is here to stay."
fresh,"I'm excited to see where Man of Steel goes, now that it's accomplished its own bit of world building. There's every reason to expect the inevitable sequels will be better."
rotten,What's missing in Snyder's Superman is a dash of the hokey goodness that Christopher Reeve contributed to the role and the comic cold cheesiness that Gene Hackman and Terrence Stamp brought as Luthor and Zod.
fresh,"Man of Steel is a very good superhero movie, but it's not necessarily a fun superhero movie."
fresh,"I wish it had done more than just include lots of shots of people looking reverentially up in the sky, but it does open up some promising avenues for the series going forward."
rotten,It's bland and boring.
rotten,[Henry Cavill's] only apparent superpower is boring the audience.
fresh,"Man of Steel chooses breakneck speed over character development, and there are times when everyone in the room will be looking at each other to see if anyone is following what's happening."
rotten,"This is not a missed opportunity which rightfully elicits a sigh, but inert big-budget spectacle that is nigh deserving of contempt."
rotten,"A movie about the clash of gods should feel more epic, more awestruck, less in a hurry to get to the next uninspired plot point."
fresh,"The plot's sci-fi gobbledygook gets awfully unwieldy, and I wish the colors had popped instead of settling for such dreary realism. But this is a movie with a big heart, just like its hero."
fresh,"Clark's multiple father-and-son tales are beautifully realized and it's a very fun movie to watch. However, the romance is shallow."
fresh,"...while it doesn't achieve the brilliance of the modern Batman franchise, and while it certainly has a few flaws... the action is undeniably well-done and there are still good character bits throughout."
rotten,"A robotic exercise in moviemaking that will no doubt satisfy the requirements of millions of distracted moviegoers who no longer require absolute engagement to be entertained-and who might, in fact, prefer exactly that."
rotten,"A gritty, realistic story shot by a director whose instincts constantly push him away from grit and realism, and into flash and fantasy."
fresh,"Despite its excessive running time, and slightly meandering narrative, Man of Steel has definitely earned its place amongst recent comic-book adaptations, standing tall in the DC / Marvel cinematic universe."
rotten,"Christliness has always been an element of the Superman myth. But this film's near literal insistence upon it becomes absurd since director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer don't dramatize the analogy, they presume it."
rotten,"Like the man with a hammer to whom every problem looks like a nail, to Nolan and Goyer, every superhero universe apparently looks like Gotham City."
fresh,"Action-packed, briskly-paced and featuring a stellar cast, Man of Steel is the best Superman film since the 1978 original and proves DC can match Marvel in the massive scale department."
rotten,"Action scenes shouldn't be dull, especially large-scale ones devastating half of a city, but that's exactly what threatens to happen here."
fresh,[Zach] Snyder who made his mark with the film 300 can manipulate images but fails to bring them to life.
fresh,"A definite step-up from the last attempt to revive this character, but there's something still missing from this origin story. Other franchise builders have done more with less, but here that isn't for lack of trying."
fresh,Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is a gritty and realistic take on one of the most iconic superheroes ever. It's visually astonishing and action-packed.
fresh,MAN OF STEEL is everything you've ever wanted in a Superman movie
rotten,Action-filled but less than super: yet another summer blockbuster
rotten,"No fun costume change in a phone booth, no wowing humans with his powers and no repartee with reporter Lois Lane."
rotten,"A solid film, but a solid Superman?"
fresh,"Snyder delivers the type of undeniable, overwhelming charge with which he's become Sny-nonymous, and his affinity for spectacle strongly courses throughout."
rotten,"The screenplay by David S. Goyer is like an arm wrestling match between brain and muscle, and when one takes charge the other falls out of line."
fresh,"Uma boa releitura do personagem. Se era necessária, porém, é outra história."
rotten,The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace...
rotten,"Man Of Steel plunges headfirst into a loud, breathless science-fiction slugfest, offering much spectacle but little wonder."
rotten,"Super-duper-overStatement. A cataclysm-caravan of speeches, doomed and desolate landscapes, proclamations of glorious destiny or rebirth, and sprawling, stone-faced seriousness. Can't save itself from self-suffocating grandiosity."
fresh,"For two-thirds of the running time, the film is grandly entertaining.... But then, as we get into the climactic battles, the level of wanton destruction becomes excessive, even tacky."
fresh,"The battles between Superman and the evil Kryptonians set a new standard for on-screen urban destruction, but they also give us pause: Aren't hundreds, even thousands being killed in the riveting, spectacular smashing of skyscraper after skyscraper?"
rotten,"Man Of Steel suffers most in its final hour where in degenerates into a seen-it-all-before, CGI-laden action fest."
fresh,Man of Steel indirectly tackles the conundrum of how a mankind engrained in monolithic religion greets the concrete proof of a mythological figure. Is it possible for an alien from Krypton to reside alongside an unquestioning faith in Christ?
rotten,"The movie consists of endless declamation, endless violence."
fresh,"Superman's grand, mythic nature is both his greatest strength as a character and his fatal weakness. Man of Steel can't quite overcome this, but it's a heck of a lot of fun watching it try."
fresh,"While it gives you your fix, it doesn't put Superman back on top of our cinematic superheroes."
fresh,"Although the CGI takes over far too many times, the personality and inner torment of the 'Man of Steel' win out over the special effects."
fresh,"Though fans might miss the levity that made Richard Donner's classic 1978 film Superman: The Movie such a game-changing joy, the thing that really sells this respectful reboot is the dramatic conviction underlying all the mega-scale mayhem."
fresh,"With a gray and gritty palette and interesting structure, offers its share of thrills but may be too somber overall to appease the typical summer blockbuster fan."
rotten,"In many ways, this is the strongest Superman reboot for a long time. Yet the story manages to be both rushed and overlong, and Snyder doesn't know when to say stop."
fresh,"It'll be controversial, but to hell with it: Michael Shannon is a better General Zod than Terrence Stamp. There. I said it."
rotten,"For all its ambition, Man Of Steel fails to soar, instead crashlanding in a humourless, melodramatic mess of explosions."
fresh,A mostly-entertaining dark science-fiction parable about morality.
rotten,A superhero boom crash opera
fresh,"Snyder largely succeeds in creating an epic piece of blockbuster filmmaking that still understands the value of smaller, intimate moments."
rotten,"Man of Steel fails to get off the ground, with Snyder's overblown display of style smothering the many interesting moments that delve into the man behind the red cape."
fresh,Parental drama is Man of Steel's most potent weapon. For all of the film's issues - and they will be discussed - it resonated on a deeply emotional level. That alone helps it to stand tall above the pack.
rotten,The film is about finding your inner child and acceptance and maturing into something greater. This is what gives me hope for the inevitable sequel.
fresh,"The problem with Man of Steel is that while the background story and character development are solid, the action sequences are distressingly generic and bland."
fresh,"An unceasing torrent of CGI explosions, destruction and superhuman Kryptonian combat, Man of Steel is more bang for your summer movie buck, but would there was magic and spark to go along with all that muscle."
rotten,"Good old fashioned fun is treated as something passé in Zack Snyder's Superman reboot, which is long, laborious and repetitive."
rotten,"Re-booting the franchise is fraught with Kryptonite, however. And the filmmakers paralyze the audience with repetitive fight sequences"
rotten,"The movie is so jam-packed and busy that it's essentially an origin story, a coming-of-age story, a science fiction film, a superhero movie, an alien invasion, and a disaster movie all bumping into each other."
rotten,"Man of Steel proves a Saturday afternoon B movie remains that no matter how big the budget or how much CGI work is done. It's in the film's DNA - the screenplay ... it sinks under the weight of its own overheated, overstated cinematic fat suit"
fresh,"The film is an adrenalin rush - a welcome jab in the arm and a large-scale escapist fantasy that propels us up, up and away"
rotten,Chaotic and unfocused.
fresh,Snyder's style is all about the iconography of rippling muscles and fights to the death; it's the down-to-earth elements of the Superman mythos that get short shrift here.
fresh,Cavill makes a super Superman but the film drags a little and could use some humor.
fresh,"Was it in Shannon's contract to have the same amount of screen time as the title character? Trouble is, he's as overdone as the product placements that are immune to the destruction."
fresh,"I like this latest version of Superman. I was expecting a darker, more depressing movie with the sado-masochistic overtones, of say, the recent Batman movies. Thankfully, this superhero movie is more upbeat than I expected."
rotten,"While expertly rendered by the film's army of special effects artists, the violence feels simultaneously bloated and empty, yet another exercise in wide-scale cinematic decimation without any sense of humanity or the weight of its loss."
fresh,I'm convinced there's probably a pretty darn good 105-minute movie wrapped inside this unwieldy 143-minute one -- not that we'll ever see it
fresh,"An occasionally exciting, intelligent and visually impressive sci-fi adventure with a fine cast. It is also frequently excessive and over-produced, but then what else should one expect from a summer blockbuster?"
fresh,"Snyder gives fans and general audiences a chance to revel in everything Superman is capable of, as writer Goyer cultivates the man and the hero..."
fresh,"The good and grand things outnumber the bad, but the film works as hard as it can to keep that from being the case."
rotten,"""Man of Steel"" shows evidence that [the filmmakers] were on the right track, but then they allowed the film to de-evolve into a chaotic mess."
fresh,"Eschews camp and lends Superman a genuinely fantastic, spiritual heft, one that grounds the ruthless destruction to come and elevates it above mere popcorn spectacle."
rotten,I know I feel cheated. I wonder what the real fans will think.
rotten,"Red underpants and kryptonite are conspicuously absent, but this dour picture still feels overfamiliar and rote."
fresh,It's good to have Superman back.
rotten,"Intended to be a continuation, this sequel seems more like an unnecessary prolongation. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Aided by one of the worst climaxes in film history, Fifty Shades Darker fails in every possible way."
rotten,This will be a great film to watch on mute.
rotten,"It's a vanilla picture that fancies itself daring and erotic. Honestly, viewers will likely find more sexual currency in The LEGO Batman Movie than in this picture."
rotten,"A cold shower of a movie. 'It's all wrong,' Ana says at one point. 'All of this is wrong.' Truer words have never been spoken."
rotten,"Fifty Shades Darker seems like it's supposed to be naughty and kinky, but it just comes off as self-serious without the expertise or know-how to make it worthwhile."
rotten,"Christian reiterates that he makes $24,000 every 15 minutes, which is impressive for a guy who grew up with a ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" poster on his bedroom wall."
rotten,Fifty Shades Darker isn't love. It's abuse. Pure and simple.
rotten,You can be a feminist and like 'Fifty Shades'. You can be a cinephile and still understand why 'Fifty Shades' exists and finds its audience. Of course I wish that those women (and me) had more choice and a better choice.
rotten,Who are these films made for?
rotten,Let's all pour hot lava into our eyes. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,This movie was mind-numbing.
rotten,This movie was garbage.
rotten,"They are about people who talk a lot about feelings and love and closeness and pain, but we never see any clear-cut examples of any of them. There's a lot of telling, but almost no showing."
fresh,"My one bugaboo about the first film was its unwillingness to lean as hard into schlock territory as it could have, and Fifty Shades Darker most certainly does."
rotten,"It does have a fatal flaw, though. It's boring. Halfway through, I gave up looking for originality in the plot and started wondering what to get from McDonald's for lunch."
rotten,Fifty Shades Darker is another boring entry into a series that is somehow shaping up to be even worse than the source material it is based on.
rotten,One of the least likable couples in the history of visual media.
rotten,Happy Valentine's Day! I hope you like garbage.
rotten,"Darker flails indecisively between elegance and lewdness and ends up owning neither. Bland, silly and riddled with bewildering and snort-inducing moments, Fifty Shades Darker is ultimately unsatisfying."
rotten,"Between the barely-concealed disdain between the two leads and the story's willingness to conflate sub-dom sexuality and straight-up abuse, the filmmakers' desperate attempts at sensuality are either off-putting, unintentionally hilarious or both."
rotten,"The film is so dull you really do need to be a masochist to sit through it, although some viewers may find the lavish wealth porn an escapist turn on."
fresh,"It won't change any lives, but it will give many ladies what they want."
rotten,Fifty Shades Darker is disappointing. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Like Kristen Stewart in Twilight before her, she is the conduit that lets the audience experience the dream of Christian Grey."
rotten,"Far too often, the (film) has Johnson acting against a whispering wall of emotionless abs regurgitating lines off a page rather than a composed, professional performer."
rotten,I'm actually tempted to go back and give extra stars to other films I thought were horrible because before Fifty Shades Darker I didn't know what I didn't know.
fresh,This movie is more of a romance film than the first one and the actors seem to be a bit more comfortable in their roles.
rotten,"It has some atrocious acting, and somehow Dornan manages to keep his trousers on for the first two-thirds of the movie. But (and I know this is damning with faint praise) it's not completely awful and Johnson in particular is rather good."
rotten,"When ""Darker"" is light, it almost works. Those moments are few and far between."
rotten,"While Fifty Shades Darker is by no means a good movie, it's a majestically stupid piece of exploitation filmmaking that entertains despite its ample flaws making it an instant camp classic."
rotten,This is nothing but an 118-minute cringe fest from beginning to end that is some way somehow significantly worse than its predecessor.
fresh,"The sequel is slightly more interesting for its revelations - Christian's horrific childhood and resulting pathology, the ""psychological"" reasons for his sadism."
rotten,"When the film isn't peddling those romantic fantasies, it gracelessly plods its story forward, maneuvering itself through conflicts that feel more like diversions from all the empty sex and materialism than anything else."
fresh,Fifty Shades Darker is better than Fifty Shades of Grey in every imaginable way.
rotten,"It's important to convey how dull this film is. Add to that tedium the terrible dialogue, choppy plotting and lack of chemistry between the leads, and the real sadism is demanding that 50 Shades fans to sit through this."
rotten,"""You taught me how to f***, she taught me how to love"" is an actual line in the movie"
rotten,"With clunky dialogue and an excessively stupid building mystery, Foley's slavishly faithful adaptation is the best unintentional comedy of the year."
rotten,... the leads have the chemistry of damp toast.
rotten,"This is not so much Fifty Shades Darker as Fifty Shades Duller, and on so many fronts too."
rotten,"At least a touch more zany than the last one, even if it's still choking a bit on its own attempts to feint at respectability."
rotten,"A muddle of half messages wearing a mask of false confidence, giving the director carte blanche to move his characters from one shaky ordeal to the next without having to contemplate the ramifications."
rotten,"I couldn't even find the enthusiasm to blank out 1 hour and 55 minutes of utter tedium and just focus on the bit where Jamie Dornan does three pull ups, repeatedly, in my mind."
rotten,"For all its attempts at eroticism, the movie is aggressively uninteresting."
rotten,"If this is what us gals are supposed to salivate over on Valentine's Day, I remain disappointed in Hollywood's expectations of women."
rotten,"I'll give Fifty Shades Darker this much, at least: The sex scenes are OK."
rotten,"Watching Fifty Shades Darker, the sequel to 2015's Fifty Shades of Grey, was akin to having ice cream after getting all four wisdom teeth removed: there is a relieving sweetness, but it still hurts like hell to swallow."
fresh,They (Leonard and Foley) do take it to the outer limits that made films like Black Swan and Showgirls enjoyable; meaning it's more enjoyable if you don't take it all so seriously.
fresh,Fans of the books and the first movie will nonetheless relish it as a tame contemporary bodice-ripper flick. Others can savor it as a satirical critique of the co-opting of BDSM by the conspicuous consumerism embodied by its billionaire Alpha male hero.
rotten,"What will these people talk about when the sex gets boring? And trust me, it WILL get boring, because it was certainly boring as hell to watch."
rotten,"If the film was any more shallow, it would be a piss-puddle in Death Valley."
rotten,"A slapdash effort, poorly written and poorly directed, full of laughably underdeveloped subplots"
rotten,"Fifty Shades Darker is not darker or better. It's watered down, raincoat-brigade style erotica, even with the spiced-vanilla S&M."
fresh,"While Fifty Shades Darker may be the year's most terrible film, it was hard to hate it; its over-ridiculousness oddly brought humor and entertainment."
rotten,Fifty Shades Darker is a film so profoundly awful that no one involved with it comes out looking good.
rotten,"Fifty Shades Darker, which fails so many tests of basic storytelling competence, is all the more stunning for its success at a task that most movies don't even bother attempting: depicting a woman's sexual pleasure."
rotten,"There's an awful lot of missionary position in this movie, the plentiful sex scenes directed as if all involved just want to get it overwith already."
rotten,"[A] rather insipid, flavourless and tired game of love and seduction."
rotten,"Fifty Shades Darker isn't only duller than its predecessor, but less ""sexual"" if we compare the scenes of intimacy between this new film and the first. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"A bland fairy tale, pretty disastrous on a dramatic level, of the romantic girl and the dominating blue prince. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The worst thing to happen to fictional Seattle since Frasier bedded Roz.
rotten,"Darker discusses consent, sexual boundaries, trauma and relationship autonomy with a frankness that honestly makes it, despite soap-opera drama and predictability, a pretty good movie."
rotten,"This tedious sequel is more of the same, for better and worse - except that it lacks the freshness of the original and feels more transparent in its effort to appeal strictly to basic instincts."
rotten,"Fifty Shades Darker is what you'd expect from encoring a regrettable one-night stand. Not a keeper, but nothing to gnaw off your arm about."
rotten,"Even someone with Johnson's considerable charisma can't get any heat going with a block of wood like this. Actually, to call his performance wooden is an insult to wood, which is a fine natural resource that demonstrably makes our world a better place."
rotten,The movie is mostly a wash-rinse-repeat cycle: There is a connection between them; then there is conflict; this is resolved by a trip to the bedroom. Or the shower with all their clothes on.
rotten,"Fifty Shades Darker seems to plod through plot points dutifully for fans of the book, but director James Foley can't do much to keep it coherent."
rotten,"Nothing ever feels alive in this film. It's a couple of automatons acting out a play that was based on other plays, that was based on other plays, and so on and so forth."
rotten,"Dumb, shallow, stilted and more cringe-inducing than sexy. It's one of the funniest unintentional comedies of the year."
fresh,"The film doesn't generates any kind of interest, either at the melodramatic level or in other contextual ideas of the movie. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Having elided the central and very interesting question of this unequal relationship, the film then throws multiple external threats into the mix, as if it knows the couple itself is now boring."
rotten,"the stuff of a potboiler, and one that is ready, willing, and able to boil over into the ridiculous with alarming regularity"
rotten,"It's less sensual, more the cinematic equivalent of some tanked women at a hen's night hooting over a penis straw."
rotten,"A film of a plastic eroticism that, compared to outstanding works like the Last tango in Paris (Ultimo Tango to Parigi, 1972) or Basic Instincts (1992), are Fifty Shades Darker, sillier and dumber. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,It's about 50 shades sillier than the first one.
rotten,Thank god this insult of a movie doesn't try to fool us into believing that the controlling Christian Grey is appealing. That would be even more horrific...
rotten,"You have to get past the obvious dialogue, the repetitive plot, the less than scintillating sexual encounters, the wasted supporting cast, the Ben Wa balls and the scene where a shirtless hunk works out to a terrible Police song."
rotten,"To justify seeing 'Fifty Shades Darker' for being Valentine's, is like saying that having a romantic dinner sitting on a busy street is a good idea. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"It fails in its development, everything becomes predictable and the promised darkness never comes. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It's saucy, forgettable escapism."
rotten,Fifty Shades Darker has been just as unbearable and even more absurd than Fifty Shades of Gray so it ends up being worse. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"Including laughable dialogue, cardboard characters and a nonexistent plot, Fifty Shades Darker is one of the first bad films of 2017. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"We can discuss the soapy narrative, stiff dialogue, absent chemistry, absurd plot devices and vulgar wealth-porn all we like; the fact is you either already plan on seeing this or you don't."
rotten,"James Foley seems committed to preserving the atmosphere of flavorless, plot-free tedium and unsexy smut established by Sam Taylor-Johnson (and, presumably, carried over from E.L. James' novels, though there is no realistic way to know for sure)."
rotten,. . . a Harlequin paperback with NSFW accessories . . .
rotten,"...the film's idea of ""kinky sex"" is laughably tame."
rotten,"The story of a woman who gives her man better values and a man who gives his woman better clothes, both of them suffering so much for a little bit of nookie."
rotten,"Trashy and tawdry, tarnishing the luster of Valentine's Day..."
rotten,Has even the target audience for this junk finally had enough?
fresh,"Less BDSM and more boring sex makes this a weaker, though ultimately more compelling entry in the series."
rotten,"It's glossy and at times goofily funny, mostly thanks to Johnson's subtle comic skills, but the novelty of this messy relationship is really beginning to wear off."
rotten,A movie this bad deserves to have its flaws enunciated clearly...
rotten,"Let's make no bones; the reason to see ""Fifty Shades Dumber"" is really for the plethora of erotic scenes, but without the benefit of a director with a knack for sexual choreography or leads with an ounce of chemistry, even those become impotent."
rotten,"Without Sam Taylor-Johnson at the helm, it lacks the knowing bite of its playful predecessor."
rotten,"An embarrassment. Billionaire crybaby ""sadist"" Mr. Grey refuses to be touched. Which means in this fairy tale fellatio is verboten. Anna never praises his instrument. There's no penis idolatry in Mr. Grey's Red Room."
rotten,What was at the very least tantalizing and sensual in the first film is now gone in exchange for a wealth of questionable emotional drama that is sadistic in its own way.
fresh,"A well-made sex melodrama designed for the mommy-porn loving masses. It's like a soap opera with bondage, or Mills & Boon with whips and handcuffs...it offers soft-centred transgression for supermarket shoppers, polite perversion for the multiplex."
rotten,"The danger is stripped away to the point that Anastasia has to keep reminding Christian that at any moment he can slip back into his dominant, punishing ways - just to justify the ""Darker"" in the title."
rotten,Anything that even remotely worked about the first film was largely removed for the second film and what was already bad in Fifty Shades of Grey became significantly less tolerable in its followup.
rotten,"To say Fifty Shades Darker is a disappointment is not only an understatement but a ridiculous one. Let's be clear, it was never going to be good."
rotten,The follow-up to Fifty Shades of Grey should really be called Fifty Shades of Vanilla.
rotten,"A really cheesy soap opera with intermittent scenes of smutty sex. It's certainly better than the first one, albeit that's a low bar to clear."
fresh,"Personally I think the three books and the two films to date are interesting in their way. They are not golden, but then they are not vanilla either."
rotten,"Their relationship, however, still suffers from all kinds of ick that prevents the film from being enjoyed as escapist entertainment."
rotten,The last movie in the trilogy is due out in a year's time so perhaps it will cause all that has preceded it to make more sense.
rotten,"The only really satisfying wish-fulfillment fantasy of Fifty Shades Darker come when the twenty-something Ana is both promoted from her entry-level position to replace her boss, and has her savvy opinions praised by two older men in a staff meeting."
rotten,"Oh, why am I even bothering? After watching those first 10 minutes, here's what watching the rest of Fifty Shades Darker is like: watching paint dry."
fresh,"The movies aren't so bad they're good. They're so brilliantly bad they're genius, with Foley dutifully presenting every inane plot point while gifting us excuses to laugh."
rotten,"The volume of hysterical moments is beyond belief, some of them so patently absurd I almost started to wonder if Foley was making a clandestine parody."
rotten,"Laughable dialogue (""I'm too dressed""), wasted talent and a frustrating romance with zero heat."
rotten,Everyone involved could have saved so much time and energy by charging triple the price for a ticket and combining all three books into one satisfying movie. Or at least one as satisfying as the source material would allow.
rotten,"Other than Dornan's exceptional physique, the movie offers little gratification, delayed or otherwise."
rotten,"S&M with ""no rules, no punishments, and no more secrets."" Where's the fun in that?"
rotten,It's alluring when it isn't trying so damn hard to convince you it's sexy.
rotten,"A missed opportunity; Lacks emotive moments, is plagued with unexplained twists and unanswerable resolutions, and there's not even a peak of tension that captures the viewer. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Darker is also funnier than Grey: both intentionally, as Dornan discovers a goofiness to match Johnson's deadpan wit; and inadvertently, as it consists largely of grandiose gestures and tin-eared dialogue."
rotten,The kind of movie that's fun only when you're laughing at its flaccid attempts at drama.
rotten,"Despite paying lip service to identity politics and whatever fantasy of social power feminism has warped into, Fifty Shades Darker indicates that Hollywood's heterosexual films have abandoned conscience for titillation."
rotten,If Jane Austen wrote mommy porn it would be so much better than this.
rotten,"More sex, less banter in graphic but bland sequel."
rotten,"Passengers has a lot going for it, but the entire treatment feels mishandled, misguided, and a missed opportunity."
rotten,Passengers biggest issue is its finale.
rotten,The worse possible waste of a heap of charisma
rotten,"It becomes clear before long that the futuristic sci-fi outing Passengers, aka Grab 'Em By the P***y: The Movie, could only have been written by a man."
rotten,"As an exploration of human isolation and a moral fable about personal freedom, however, Passengers is threadbare and trite."
rotten,A few tweaks could have turned it into a creepy look at Jim's desperation or an amusing film about technology gone wrong - imagine if Hal from 2001 was an automated customer service attendant - but instead its done in by the story's sexist undercurrent.
rotten,Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence can't even save this sinking ship. This movie is a boat you should miss.
rotten,"The last-man-on-earth concept isn't exactly new, but adapting it into a far-flung intergalactic environment provides oodles of potential."
rotten,An ultimately unsatisfying yet passable from a cast capable of and likely expecting so much more.
rotten,"What he does next is unforgivable, as is his duplicitous cover up, but perhaps a smarter, bleaker film could have played it as a brutal moral dilemma faced by a desperate man who must then face the consequences."
rotten,It's rare to find a film in which one problem is so morally reprehensible that it ruins the entire thing.
rotten,"There's a saying that in space, no one can hear you scream. After watching Passengers, in space, no one can hear you endlessly groan or watch you roll your eyes."
rotten,"Passengers has no idea how to deal with the consequences of its choices, so it simply chooses not to."
fresh,I had fun in this movie.
fresh,It was like a Nicholas Sparks action movie in space.
rotten,From here the movie descends into blandness and stays there until the whimper of an ending.
rotten,"The good news is, in six months, nobody will remember that Passengers ever existed."
fresh,It's rare for being good sci fi that doesn't involve zapping things with ray guns. It's a story about how technology sometimes puts people in impossible situations that no human has ever been faced with before.
fresh,"The considerable charisma and chemistry of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence keep the sci-fi adventure Passengers afloat, even if the script easily fixes its most fascinating problems."
rotten,It all just panders too much.
rotten,"Silly and disappointing, Passengers suffers from focusing on all the wrong aspects of a potentially intriguing narrative."
fresh,"With minimal cast members, the main actors had to be chosen wisely...Lawrence and Pratt were excellent options as they truly meet both criteria."
rotten,"If toxic masculinity were a film, this would be it."
rotten,Passengers is morally reprehensible and functionally inert. It is anti-entertaining and potent nightmare fuel for anyone who dares think women have agency outside of finding a nice man.
fresh,"There are enough twists and turns from the get go to keep audiences intrigued and to provide an enjoyable, entertaining movie outing."
rotten,The movie doesn't have the guts to delve into the intensity and heartache that the setup demands and instead settles for absurdity and clichés.
fresh,Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence have terrific chemistry.
rotten,"One can either make a thriller about existential threats in the emptiness of space or love lost to time, but this film lacks the skill needed to successfully blend the two."
fresh,"It offers an entertaining two hours but the characters fail to provoke emotional attachment, so it's likely to fade from memory rapidly."
rotten,"If the filmmakers had focused more on the story, instead of betting on the two hugely-popular leads to carry the film, this movie would be so much better."
rotten,"Pratt and Lawrence shine, but chemistry alone can't carry Passengers."
rotten,"The film is flat and lifeless, squandering a decent concept, an excellent cast and an engaging aesthetic."
fresh,"Despite all its bumbling adultness, Passengers does the pop-entertainer basics right: it transports us into its world, no matter how outrageous or flawed."
fresh,Passengers offers a sci-fi romance with a thought-provoking twist.
rotten,"Jim, woken 90 years too soon on a space voyage, then wakes up Aurora, for company and possibly better coffee on her first class ticket. The stalker-in-space love story premise is very troubling; luckily Michael Sheen's android barman is terrific."
rotten,Passengers is a movie that starts out intriguing enough before descending towards some of the creepiest storytelling decisions in a long time but with a desperate need to somehow justify the unjustifiable.
fresh,"Passengers is not the Hollywood disaster the mainstream critics would have you believe, but it is a flawed film hampered under the weight of its scope."
rotten,"Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt hold up their end, but the script for Passengers ultimately fails us all."
rotten,There is a rush to get to Imagine Dragons' new song and the accompanying nebula-laden credits.
rotten,I scored it six out of 10.
rotten,"A visually beautiful attempt at a vehicle for Lawrence and Pratt, but it's arguably shallow premise and uninspired plotting makes this just an idea lost in space."
rotten,To say more would be spoiling it - though it's difficult to spoil something when it's already this rotten.
rotten,Couldn't she have been the mechanic? Or could Jim have been the cook? Something to attempt a realistic representation of non-Hollywood genders?
fresh,
rotten,"Tyldum's picture, you see, is a prime example of how a promising story set in the wild starry yonder can crash and burn, even with some of the most likeable actors in the business."
fresh,"Although Passengers is the direct opposite of Gravity, Interstellar or The Martian, it garners interest when it delves into the primary need for human interaction. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"So how do you mess this up? By making Pratt's character a reprehensible creep, making Lawrence's his unwitting victim, and expecting us to root for their romance anyway."
rotten,... what we have here is a Franken-stitching of three genres among this sci-fi genre...
rotten,Passengers is not a good trip. Director Morten Tyldum's film is a mish-mash of genres and premised on a creepy plot point.
fresh,"Like a Titanic in space, Passengers is a rare combination of genres. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"If you go see a movie with your family or significant other on Christmas Day, only suggest Passengers if you hate them"
fresh,It's a great-looking film with an original idea. Watch it for its stars but it won't have an astronomical impact on you.
rotten,Morten Tyldum again reveals his limited ability to provide empathy and true depth to the characters. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"The film does have a certain visual appeal, but the story is thin and riddled with plot holes. Still, at least Michael Sheen is fun as a cocktail-shaking android."
rotten,"Passengers is an incredibly creepy movie in which a woman succumbs to Stockholm Syndrome and falls for her stalker and stays with him even though the stupid ending wants to be ambiguous but it's not, this movie never met the concept of subtlety."
rotten,"If not for Pratt and Lawrence, this sci-fi flick would have been lost in space."
fresh,"[Morten] Tyldum wisely sticks to the human story at the center of this epic-looking tale of the vast, unchartered terrain of the human heart."
rotten,The actors just couldn't make it work in Morten Tyldum's disastrous Passengers.
rotten,"Passengers veers from comedy to tragedy, from romance to action movie, before ending on a note that feels too rushed and too chipper, even by Hollywood standards."
rotten,Passengers takes what could have been an interesting debate about consent and glosses it over with cheesy romance and problematic sex.
rotten,"Passengers is not technically a horror film, but that's the mode in which it would work best. Instead, it's a predictable space-saving drama, one whose big twist is both not so big at all and its ultimate undoing."
fresh,An entertaining but somewhat corny sci-fi fantasy romance film with aspirations to be a deep thinking film.
rotten,"Jennifer Lawrence and Christ Pratt are both extremely likable actors, and the situation they're in is actually a pretty interesting one. One that would have been just as interesting without the icky stalker scenario."
fresh,"Passengers still manages to woo us with the kind of intense love and obsession you don't see often, especially in the world of sci-fi. And some of us tend to be suckers for stuff that has a whiff of ""true love."""
rotten,"Passengers is such a mixed bag. Lots of people are not going to be able to get past the controversial premise; others, like myself, may be impressed that its grand stage holds such lofty goals, only to be let down as things veer off into the expected."
rotten,A movie that offers big questions but oftentimes settles for the easiest answers.
rotten,The most lighthearted movie about existential despair you'll likely ever see.
fresh,"Passengers entertained me, it made me laugh, and even had me tense at times. It's one of those films that, if they ask me in the street, I say ""yeah, it's ok"". [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Not only is it a terrible film, but it is built upon the most disturbing premise I've encountered in the cinema in a long time."
fresh,The screenplay from Jon Spaihts will leave you questioning the actions of both characters as the credits start to roll.
rotten,"A film that starts well, but that, despite its amazing performances and visual effects that work, ends in a completely predictable and stereotyped way . [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,It's the feature-length adaptation of that article about how to talk to a girl wearing headphones.
fresh,"A brave film that exposes all its elements openly and reflects, in different ways, a sense of great cinema that at times seems to have been lost. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,The film's greatest sin is its intrinsic dullness.
rotten,Passengers so proudly boasts star power and visual panache that it takes a while to notice the limp romantic subplot that serves as featured in-flight entertainment.
rotten,An interesting narrative -- strained by Titanic problems... because even in the future nothing works.
rotten,"the film's various ethical and moral issues fall to secondary status in the climatic act, which sacrifices drama for action and, worse, uses the latter to excuse massive, potentially unbelievable character shifts in the former"
fresh,"Passengers does its best to coast through the cinematic realm fuelled by star power and shiny surfaces, boasting enough of both to keep your eyes engaged, but not your heart or mind."
rotten,A film that lacks the human and philosophical depth of Gravity or Arrival. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,The questionable decision to turn what is essentially a kidnapping into a romance without debating the consequences doesn't allow us to fully sink our teeth into the tale.
fresh,"A beautiful, exciting and impossible love story and a few well-executed winks to sci-fi classics. [Full review in Spanish]"
fresh,"The production design here is spectacular and utopian - a delirious idea of a future that's perfectable, a world without blemish."
rotten,Ultimately Passengers can't stay the course of its own cascading errors.
rotten,"The film does serve as a timely metaphor for much of Hollywood product these days: beautiful, exacting visual work helping dress up a threadbare story."
rotten,"The film could've been written by one of those dudes who are always complaining about ""how women only like bad guys and never look at the nice ones"". [Full review in Portuguese.]"
rotten,The problem with Passengers is not the selfishness but the laziness with which it has been wrapped in the garb of 'love'.
rotten,This obviously messed-about science-fiction-drama-cum-romance is both disappointing and surprisingly unsavoury.
fresh,"The film does a good job of portraying a desperately lonely man's dilemma and the romance that follows. Although it suffers from the restriction of a tiny cast of characters, there is good romantic chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence."
rotten,"Passengers is yet another example of a film that falsely beckons a certain premise in its promotions, yet eventually delivers something far less interesting."
fresh,A film confusing and derivative at times but there's something magnetic in the ambition of a story that goes through everything and is encouraged to flirt with ridicule without falling into it. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"A movie that has visual and sound power and manages to entertain during the great part of its footage. However, it causes a certain sense of disappointment at not being able to exploit the enormous potential of the story. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"When it comes to exploring the big picture, space provides filmmakers with pretty much a blank canvas."
rotten,"Its ending is laughable, borrowing at least two different plot holes from Star Trek: Into Darkness. (Splice Today)"
rotten,"It's hard to know what's worse here; the jaw-dropping misogyny on show or the lazy, ridiculously convenient world building that is there purely to service the plot."
rotten,"A dumb, poorly written piece of CGI spectacle, the eye candy on display sullied by the sexism that riddles its minimal plot."
rotten,'Passengers' starts as a promising sci-fi story and closes as a heartbreaking and routinely romantic comedy. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"There's something pretty hollow, even spacey, at the reaction-core of this star-vehicle."
fresh,"Pratt, Lawrence and the superficial aspects of the story, along with the gorgeous aesthetic, are compelling enough to make Passengers at the very least interesting, and not a waste of your time."
fresh,"There is fun to be found, but when is all said and done, the eyes may be sated, but the brain's still craving."
fresh,There are benefits to be reaped if you can find a way to forgive Passengers its obvious flaws.
rotten,An all-round flimsy scripts undermines what was at one point this year one of the most anticipated sci-fi films of 2016.
rotten,"On top of its moral quagmire of a premise, Passengers is dire in almost every other regard."
rotten,It's awfully pretty...and awfully dumb.
rotten,Passengers a bland journey.
fresh,"It was going so well. In the first hour of this ultra-slick sci-fi, director Morten Tyldum presents a dark and difficult premise that gnaws away at the superficial beauty before us."
fresh,"Passengers is entertaining enough, lovely to look at and there are some ingenious touches."
rotten,"After a promising takeoff, this science-fiction romance derails its intriguing futuristic premise about intergalactic travel with an abundance of cheesy melodrama in its second half."
rotten,"It's taken long into the year for one of the worst of the year to rear its head, but this one snuck in just in time."
rotten,"Unfortunately, after presenting interesting questions, the script decides not to explore further, and to walk the easiest and most retouched route: a third act of Hollywood action. The trip is entertaining, but the final result is not very satisfactory."
rotten,"A long, increasingly preposterous slog whose most tantalizing element is the question of why Jennifer Lawrence looks so very much like a young Renee Zellweger in some shots."
rotten,"If the film doesn't completely rot is thanks to its production design, the chemistry between the protagonists and the participation of Michael Sheen. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,'Passengers' fails at meeting the expectations of the premise. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"A movie with a stupid ending, controversial and well intentioned but badly formulated, wasting the potential of its actors in a film that deserves to be named in the worst of the year. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Since it doesn't even get to take advantage of what its two protagonists have to give, ends up being a constant disappointment. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Any actor in the world can look stupid if he or she follows a stupid script.
rotten,"A waste of a rich premise, excellent special effects, and a charismatic cast."
fresh,"Passengers' solid third act, which is impressively tense (and doesn't even feature a bad guy!), cements its place as a somewhat erratic yet entirely entertaining sci-fi tale..."
rotten,"After a few quick nods to the profoundly unethical act at its core, the movie shrugs it off and uses it as the basis for a fairy-tale romance. This is not okay."
fresh,"Imperfect though it may be, the movie explores a 'What would you do?' moral issue with enough inquisitiveness and entertainment value to make for a reasonably engaging two hours."
rotten,Passengers could have been a wonderful satire of online dating...but [Jon] Spaihts' screenplay doesn't dare go there.
rotten,But then you get to the storytelling which slowly sucks out the film’s potential.
fresh,"Hardy orchestrates horror with elegance and taste, reaching in some scenes an unexpected sophistication in the design, the choreography, and the editing... [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Despite its talented cast and the chilling location, neither director Corin Hardy nor the screenplay engages the viewer in any memorable or substantive way."
rotten,"Here's the thing. If there's a door in your abbey that reads 'God Ends Here' it's best to leave it closed. Burke and Co. could have done everyone, especially the audience, a favour by leaving well enough alone."
rotten,"The backstory to the creepy demon who bothered Lorraine Warren in The Conjuring 2, etc: in 1952, a priest and a novice nun are sent to Romania to investigate the apparent suicide of a young nun and the abbey in general. Disappointing."
rotten,"At its best, horror marks you. At its worst, it wastes your time and $12. The Nun, sure as all that is holy, does not leave a mark."
rotten,"While The Nun isn't good, it isn't quite as bad as its reputation."
rotten,Don't look for salvation from The Nun...
rotten,"This prequel's casting of Farmiga's sister is the only striking resemblance, as ""The Nun"" converts a once stellar franchise into a bad habit."
rotten,"For all its disappointment, it's unlikely The Nun will be the last we see of this bad habit as long as those staggering numbers remain undead."
rotten,"The Nun positions itself as slow-burning, self-aggrandizing horror, but it's too lifeless to engage. In fact, it's like looking through the windows of a pop-up Halloween store."
rotten,The Nun runs into a lot of the same problems that 2014's Annabelle did. The build up to these characters seemed more terrifying than what they were given in their actual movies.
rotten,The Nun wastes the efforts put into the set design and art direction with a lackluster story and substandard scare scenes.
rotten,"The Nun feels more like a missed opportunity than a complete disaster, but in the end, it's tough to tell the difference."
rotten,"The Nun nonetheless proves to be the weakest entry in the series so far, and next to Annabelle, that's saying something."
rotten,"If you're ready to kick off horror season a few weeks early, there are lots of opportunities to do better than this tedious nun-sense."
fresh,The pleasant surprise about this very silly movie: how old-school hokey those chills are. The scare scenes and even the style of the acting wouldn't seem at all out of place in a Mario Bava Italian horror picture of the '60s.
fresh,"If you simply enjoy being scared for the sake of it and not worrying about much else, The Nun can still be a lot of fun."
rotten,"[T]his sequel/prequel doesn't have the seriousness of the previous four films. It also has issues with logic, consistency of tone, and character development."
rotten,"The Nun isn't exactly a missed opportunity, then, so much as it's a waste of an interesting filmmaker's talents."
rotten,"Towards the end, The Nun tries to beef up its plot and eventually connects it to the rest of the franchise, but its sins are too many to ever make it interesting."
rotten,The nun is a very discreet horror film that quickly depletes its ideas and has a script full of weaknesses. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Not being high gastronomy, the new spin off of the Warren universe fools with a moderately decent presentation. [Full Review in Spanish]"
rotten,The Nun has more noise than scare for fans of fright.
rotten,The strings are forever visible and no amount of stunning production design or visual effects can mask this truth.
rotten,"The Nun is a sloppy cash-grab that further dilutes The Conjuring brand, a cinematic universe that is hilariously more profitable than the DC comic book umbrella."
fresh,"Given the film's talent, and the inventive, subepidermal shocks of its forebears The Nun is a hollow affair."
rotten,"The franchise worsens with each new episode, hitting an all-time low here."
rotten,"Despite being billed as 'the darkest chapter' within the Conjuring universe of films, The Nun is quite possibly the dullest on offer yet"
rotten,"[The Nun] had the potential to be something more, but the film lacked the authentic storytelling that makes The Conjuring series so good."
fresh,"The Nun is dripping with Gothic Horror goodness, doesn't take itself too seriously, and watching it feels *almost* like you're watching a classic Hammer Horror flick."
rotten,It's not hard to imagine why they thought this was a good idea. A franchise driven sequel that fails horribly in the art of the scare. [Full review in Spanish].
rotten,The Nun puts all its horror eggs in one jump-scare basket for a disappointing outcome.
fresh,"Why all the strange things, the vision, the nonsense? That said, I'm kind of here for it. I'm pretty happy with what I got, and if you're looking for a wild time at the movies, might I recommend The Nun..."
rotten,"It's a pity that the storyline is so weak, given that Bichir and Farmiga both give excellent performances."
rotten,"I can't say this is going to be the type of film that you'll want to plan your weekend for. At the very best, a discounted matinee watch would be the route to go, or feel free to wait for it to land on a streaming platform."
rotten,A bland and plodding piece of horror Cathsploitation.
rotten,"En vez de ver La monja, sólo vean las dos escenas en las que aparece en El conjuro 2. Seguro eso los asusta más."
rotten,The Nun winds up being a mash-up that's far more dead than alive.
rotten,"Looking to experience the promised darkest and spookiest chapter in The Conjuring universe? Sadly, your prayers have certainly not been answered here. Maybe The Crooked Man will fare a bit better, but for my money? The Nun deserved better."
rotten,"Right off the top I will say that it is not a fantastic film, but there are some creepy moments scattered throughout. Enough so that you will endure through the rest which is quite substandard."
rotten,"The jump-scares are dispensed with a kind of clockwork disregard for the broader drama or stakes; like sugary morsels of adrenaline, they're momentarily titillating but ultimately unsatisfying."
rotten,"The Nun boasts a creepy gothic atmosphere and a strong performance from Oscar nominee Demian Bichir, but thanks to its overreliance on cheap, ineffective jump scares, the film becomes just another misfire in the Conjuring universe."
rotten,"The special effects are basic, the central character of the story, the nun, is not terrifying and sometimes gives the impression that her face is a mix between the villain The Penguin and the singer Marilyn Manson. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,Taissa Farmiga deserves better.
fresh,A solid addition to this long-running series.
rotten,"""The Nun"" could have been many things; instead it's a very bad horror film. [Full Review in Spanish]"
fresh,"It's nuns amok in this bleak, deeply cliched yet effective supernatural spookster."
rotten,"Lacking anything that resembles compelling characters with actual arcs, The Nun fails that critical first test of the movies: investing the audience in the plight of its heroes."
fresh,The film boasts strong performances and some of the most striking visuals of any film in The Conjuring universe. What it lacks is fully developed characters and a complete story that connects well to the other films in the franchise
fresh,"Sets out to build a different energy from the rest of the movies in ""The Conjuring"" franchise, and for better and for worse, it accomplishes that."
rotten,"The gothic horror setting is delectable, but this is far from the Holy Grail of spin-offs. Could we not have had Sister Act 3 instead?"
rotten,"With boring, cliched attempts of mythology, an underused cast, tedious pacing and hilariously forced attempts at scares and humour, the audience is better off having ""nun"" of it."
rotten,"The Nun is one silly ""nun-sensical"" roller coaster ride of jump scares."
rotten,A Sunday visit to church would likely be more terrifying.
fresh,Old school jump scares and perhaps one of the best new monsters we've had in a long time.
rotten,This lackluster horror flick won't convert any new prophets
rotten,"Once everyone gets to the abbey, the film simply gives up the ghost and cynically indulges every horror trick in the book."
rotten,The deeper The Nun proceeds to its plotted heart of evil the less it conducts itself as a genre entry.
rotten,A money grab about pop-up scares and bloated special effects.
rotten,A serious misstep create with the sole purposes of exploiting a brand. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,You'll be 'nun' the worse for skipping this.
rotten,The worst of the Conjuring spinoffs...
rotten,"The movie's best joke, that the events depicted are based on real events, gets funnier with each elaborate set piece."
rotten,I was hoping for the conjurer's Devils of Loudun. I got THE NUN instead.
rotten,"By overly relying on jump scares, ""The Nun"" uses a mechanical approach toward instilling fear rather than a more profound understanding of terror."
rotten,"There's no real risk for The Nun to impact the future of horror or the legacy of the genre, but it's not a total loss. If only it embraced its more extravagant, indulgent side earlier, it would have been far more worth my time."
fresh,It was great to see The Conjuring Universe expanded.
rotten,"It's a slapped-together, poorly written spin-off that in no way approaches the serviceable scares of its predecessors."
fresh,A catalogue of horror sensations. [Full Review in Spanish]
rotten,"Alas, The Nun is more chaotic than most of the many, many films set in The Conjuring universe. To compare it to a ghost train would be to understate the narrative cohesion that habitually governs those seaside entertainments."
rotten,A generic horror movie. It's not good...easily one of the worst I've seen in a bit.
rotten,Nowhere near on the level of what was brought by the first two Conjuring films.
rotten,Sometimes its necessary to close cycles and it seems like this saga needs to close with something more decent. [Full Review in Spanish]
fresh,"Those who like old-fashioned Hammer horrors will certainly get a kick out of this movie, which brims with Gothic atmosphere but has no discernible plot."
fresh,The film is madly in love with the idea of old-school matinee movie horror.
fresh,"Unfortunately, it's all so routine and repetitive that it soon loses even that appeal."
rotten,Plays like a tired game of horror movie bingo where the stakes are spare change and candy corn.
rotten,"If you're not going to be scary and you're not going to be interesting, you have to be fun."
rotten,"Sadly, there are indeed no brains to be found in The Nun."
rotten,"The film is depressive without attaining poignancy, and self-serious where it could be shameless."
fresh,"Along with solid staging and the right actors, The Nun at least ensures that viewers will not get bored for 97 minutes. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The Nun is quite likely the best entry in the blockbuster The Conjuring cinematic franchise. However, this is still not much of an endorsement."
rotten,"...not much of a prequel, but it does provide more mindless fun than expected, especially when the scares are enhanced by the new immersive ScreenX format."
fresh,"While The Nun has some issues with tone and pacing, especially in the first half of the film, once the story settles in for the finale, that's when Hardy's love for the genre shines through."
rotten,"The story offers no scares or surprises (other than things popping out suddenly from corners), but it checks off the boxes without actively insulting your intelligence."
rotten,The Nun is about as terrifying as a Cub Scout weenie roast. You've been warned.
rotten,"A very fragmented, tonally disjointed film."
rotten,Every cheap scare in the book is in this movie.
rotten,"I didn't like the main actor, or at least, I couldn't hear half of what he was saying because of the accent. A lot of the dialogue was very hokey to me."
rotten,I didn't really care about the characters [and] the story didn't draw me in.
fresh,"It still works as a stand-alone film, I appreciate that."
fresh,"What it lacks, it makes up in great set designs and frightening tension; definitely a fun addition to the franchise!"
rotten,"In the third act of the film, one no longer knows whether to laugh or cry. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"The worst thing is that the plot tangles itself up on its own, like a liar. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,There's really nothing here to frighten even the most timid of horses and seasoned genre fans will be rolling their eyes in despair at The Nun's lack of originality and ambition.
rotten,"To borrow a term from Catholic dogma, I have to confess it left me cold."
rotten,"The film isn't as bad as the first Conjuring spinoff, Annabelle, but it simply isn't good enough to distinguish itself from the cavalcade of excellent horror thrillers being released this year."
rotten,"The Nun is a sequence of jump scares that starts strong, but whose horrors rapidly dwindle with each passing encounter."
rotten,"Those wanting pure scares will have a blast with The Nun. However, those that like fleshed out characters & story alongside their scares will be very disappointed."
rotten,"A derivative mediocrity, proving even bad horror movies conjure big box-office."
rotten,"Horror is one of the safest genres in terms of taking risks. That's why it always feels frustrating when movies like The Nun play it so, so safe."
rotten,"To judge by the loud snoring exploding a few seats away from me, I was not the only one who found this lugubrious excrescence less than compelling."
rotten,"""The Nun"" is sometimes bad, but mostly disappointing. Potential and a good jumping off point proved too high a bar to meet."
rotten,"A nice budget, cool location, and a decent cast in a story about selflessness in the face of the supernatural are tossed aside for the worst kind of horror movie sin: an unoriginal retread."
fresh,There's an obvious attempt at delivering something slightly more mature than what we normally see in studio-released horror films.
fresh,"Even if you don't have any relationship with religion, the film challenges what you are familiar with, whatever that may be, and succeeds at startling you to the core."
rotten,"The Nun is too repetitive and incoherent (and not in a good, fever-dreamy way) to be suspenseful. It's more boring than horrifying to play spot-the-CGI ghoul in the background of all those greyscale frames..."
rotten,"Like most successful franchise films, The Nun sets up a sequel. Judging by the most recent outing, it might be time to lay this horror series to rest."
rotten,The Nun is like a Ramsay Brothers film with better production values. Even the Ramsays never churned out this level of drivel in the name of horror.
rotten,"Shot in a color scheme that is so boring, it makes the plot look slightly interesting."
fresh,It successfully gives you the feeling that you're being ushered through an especially well designed haunted house - but by forgettable characters.
rotten,A depressingly generic picture that feels like a cash grab on the studio's part. It doesn't even seem to be trying very hard to entertain.
rotten,"This movie is dedicated to a monster that already proved to be inherently frightening, but in spite of a couple of good scares ... it never quite gets to where it [should be]."
rotten,All that is conjured before your eyes is one of the worst movies of 2018.
rotten,"More a Conjuring-themed haunted house experience than an actual credible horror movie, scary images come at you thick and fast, somehow without managing to be actually scary."
fresh,"The Nun is a thinly-sketched Conjuring spinoff that's light on real scares, but offers enough stylish atmosphere to make up (some of) the difference."
rotten,"Gradually, The Nun loses interest in being a horror film."
fresh,"The Nun isn't the full meal one would expect from films associated with The Conjuring, but it's a rather appetizing continuation of the trend that's seen major studios learning to do horror justice again."
rotten,"The film brings some fascinating ideas and some creepy imagery, but in full execution it's ""Not quite ready for prime-time""."
rotten,"The filmmakers try desperately to concoct a puzzle with a grand design, but there’s none to be found. Just a lot of flashbacks and puzzle pieces that don’t form a full picture."
fresh,"From filming style to a twisty narrative structure, Saw is a film that not only bore a franchise but has retained itself as a true horror classic."
fresh,"Most definitely not for the faint-hearted, Saw comes with an additional, vital warning: Whatever you do, do not watch any of the far inferior sequels that it sparked."
rotten,I don't think this is a good movie and the performances in this were very uneven. It didn't seem as groundbreaking as it's known for.
rotten,There was nothing remotely entertaining about this film for me. Jigsaw's logic is completely insane and when you consider how much time it took for him to plan these schemes...it gets wonky very quickly.
rotten,"It’s a far cry from the ridiculous gore-soaked torturefest the franchise has since become, but it still isn’t particularly good horror."
fresh,"While the torture porn moniker is more appropriate for the sequels that follow, Saw is a nasty piece of work with a compelling mystery at its center and an ending to die for."
fresh,"Critically derided and unfairly slapped with the Torture Porn moniker, Saw is a reflection of post 9/11 anxieties, a bastion of low budget horror filmmaking and one of the few truly iconic franchises of the 00s. Get Jiggy with it"
fresh,"The original Saw may be rough round the edges, but that unvarnished quality has a sure charm that its more cynical successors lack."
fresh,Saw remains a beloved genre staple.
fresh,A twist ending for the ages always helps a genre shine up good for the camera.
fresh,"Say what you want about the acting or even the franchise as a whole, but Saw includes one of the most unforgettable endings that you won't see coming."
fresh,"Never terribly clever, but always intestinally challenging, this successful and discomfiting collection of films shows art in extremis-a real-time effort to take mainstream entertainment to its most brutal end point."
fresh,"The sound of Jigsaw's gravely voice pouring out of the tape recorder is still as ominous a sound as one could imagine, and the big reveals still come as a genuine shock."
fresh,"It may not be one of the horror greats that many people seem to make it out to be, but Saw is crafty and ambitious enough to warrant a horror buff's time."
fresh,The horror flick Saw started a chain-Saw of sequels and that is now one of the most successful of the chop-and-slash variety. It's not a bad way to spend a Halloween evening.
rotten,"How such a cruelly empty and infantile movie got made is mystery enough. More puzzling is why Cary Elwes, Danny Glover and Monica Potter would sign on as co-stars."
rotten,"James Wan's horror film Saw is full of demented twists and guilty-looking actors, but the scenario is cruel enough to make you squirm."
rotten,Saw is a sub-Se7en B-movie serial killer chiller with more high concepts stuffed into its 100 minutes than it can handle.
rotten,"[A] contrived, unlovable gore-fest with a high-concept premise."
fresh,"It is all, of course, total nonsense. But for horror fans it's good nonsense, in the way that a creepy urban legend told by flashlight in a tent at 2 a.m. can be fine and dandy nonsense."
fresh,There's something impressively loathsome and extravagantly twisted about this horror-thriller from first-timer James Wan.
rotten,"As a study in the macabre, it barely suffices; as a sick and bloody joke, it's bloody sick."
rotten,"Though dumber than a box of rocks, Saw forges ahead with the kind of conviction and energy that will keep bad-cinema junkies sitting bolt upright."
fresh,"Just when you think you've got it sussed, the movie throws in some audacious twists, resulting in one of the most memorable climaxes in recent screen history."
fresh,Inventive and diverting entertainment for fans of moody horror mysteries. And the end is cool. Say no more.
rotten,[Its] sadism is topped only by its absurdity.
rotten,More grisly than scary; not for kids.
fresh,The horror genre takes a new direction using extreme violence to support a surprisingly evocative story of redemptive torture.
fresh,"""Saw"" has it all. Gore, violence, an excellent script, and top notch tension all put together with a whopper of a horror outing."
rotten,"Having lifted itself up so high in some ways, it's a shame that, in the end, the film sinks down to the level of just being another dumb horror movie."
fresh,"It's a brutal, vicious, well done psychological thriller that will leave you disturbed for days."
fresh,"The inconsistencies and incongruities mar the overall result, but it's a fierce enough premise to excite some investors to believe this team can do better and perhaps even bloodier."
rotten,"The setup is gripping, and the suspense intense, but the third act -- the payoff for sitting through such harrowing material -- is a major misfire."
rotten,Effectively ugly.
rotten,There is such a storm of terrible dialogue in Saw as to legitimately draw comparisons to none less than Ed Wood.
fresh,Gets by on its mood of industrial dread.
fresh,"While the great idea gets squandered, it remains a fun flick, certainly above the par of many other genre films."
fresh,Why see Saw? Because it has teeth and it cuts to the bone.
rotten,"Able to hold interest most of the way through, unraveling back stories that feel as if they might lead to something. But then the ending arrives."
fresh,"As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we've had lately."
rotten,Blood splatter antics take over and make it a tough watch for the queasy and those who still consider themselves sane.
rotten,just another collection of horror movie cliches
fresh,"...though Elwes has received a lot of criticism for his work here, the actor delivers a surprisingly effective performance that feels believable and appropriate..."
fresh,"If the film had contained more scenes of intensity and less action, gore, twists and shocks, maybe it could have been a classic of the genre."
fresh,"A twisted tale of torture and deception, Saw is a gritty Halloween snack that all trick-or-treaters should chew on."
fresh,"The simple setup ropes us in immediately and never lets up, and some of the imagery will stick with even the most hardened viewer for days."
rotten,"Saw's overly elaborate, sporadically effective do-or-die games ultimately don't make the cut."
fresh,"Original, sorprendente, terrible, intensa. Un recuerdo de lo que el cine de terror y thriller debe ser, una historia que te atrapa, y te corta en pedazos."
fresh,Saw has a surprising number of tricks up its sleeve.
rotten,"If you're looking for a geniunely scary movie, keep looking because Saw isn't it. Sadistic, yes. Gory, yes. But not scary."
rotten,Elwes in particular chews so much scenery I'm surprised any of the set was left for them to shoot the movie on.
rotten,Capped by a final plot twist so insane I almost feel obligated to salute it out of respect for its sheer lunacy.
fresh,"I'm glad I saw ""Saw"" because it was pretty good."
rotten,"I couldn't stop laughing through the whole mess, and unless you have a high tolerance for pretentious, nonsensical, unscary crap, you'll be laughing, too."
rotten,"Vile, bleak, and dismal."
rotten,"""Saw""'s intriguing and genuinely creepy premise is quickly undone by the limitations of both the script and the performers."
fresh,"the concept is appealing, and to see it acted out in front of your eyes is a guilty thrill."
rotten,"Out of Seven, I give it a 4. Genuinely creepy, however."
fresh,Yipes!
rotten,The filmmakers should have put more effort into searching for a decent lead actor and less into depicting torturous ways for people to die.
fresh,A brilliant thriller – terrifying and relentless.
rotten,"Clumsy, but crudely effective; liberating in its horrific imagery, but undone by the very same."
fresh,This is the kind of scare-fest that gets under your skin but is too busy elsewhere to penetrate your defenses.
rotten,Atrocious...I was fully ready to give up an arm and a leg to escape.
fresh,Horror fans will find plenty to shriek about. Everyone else should keep their distance.
rotten,"It's never a good thing to find yourself laughing during a horror thriller, particularly one with a menacing title like Saw. But laugh, laugh, laugh you will."
rotten,"Be prepared for plenty of grisly doings, including the performance of Cary Elwes in one of the most classically awful performances since the advent of the talking picture."
rotten,"Wan struggles to bring this hallow hedonistic horror show to its full potential. Sadly, this Saw doesn't quite cut through the tumultuous malarkey"
rotten,A pointless exercise in shock value.
fresh,"This one does its bloody job fairly well, but it'll be interesting to see what Wan and Whannell are able to achieve when they get a bigger budget."
fresh,A constantly surprising and extraordinarily tense Halloween treat.
fresh,... the cross-bred horror-thriller you've been waiting for since Seven.
rotten,James Wan's feature directorial debut is chock full of narrative holes and gratuitous gore.**
rotten,It is a more intelligent entry than most blood and gore flicks. But it has too much blood and killing for my taste.
fresh,"Saw falls apart under reflection, but serves an efficient 2-hours for hardcore horror-junkies."
fresh,"Saw dances close to the edge of cliche, but doesn't fall into the pit too often. It sets up some excellent red herrings, and I was satisfied with the ending."
rotten,Saw is all gristle and no meaty scares
fresh,"Serial-killer chiller isn't jaw-droppingly terrifying, but it's not terrifyingly bad, either."
rotten,"Chooses gore for the sake of gore, and cuts its own throat."
rotten,"Saw has art-house ambitions, but it's nothing but a glorified snuff film. I despised this movie."
rotten,...delves a bit too giddily into the cruel and torturous techniques of its villain.
rotten,"Some misguided critics are praising the film for its originality. Instead, it ought to be condemned as nothing less than Nazi filmmaking."
fresh,"While a tad derivative, Saw shows promise of better things to come from Whannell's imagination and Wan's composition."
rotten,See SAW . . . see SAW start to suck . . . See SAW suck away 2 hours
rotten,"Saw has its moments, and most of them are brutal in the extreme, but ultimately it's one tremendous misfire that will either leave you laughing or, possibly, gagging."
fresh,"Sick, demented, wrong, and just the sort of movie we deserve at Halloween time."
fresh,Raises the level of gore delightfully higher.
fresh,"""Saw"" leaves its audience saying ""Eewww"" in appreciation."
fresh,"Saw n'est pas un film d'horreur des plus réussis, ni un film particulièrement brillant [mais] il dépasse aisément le niveau des Scream et compagnie."
rotten,"Maybe if the acting were less hysterical, the characters and their fates might arouse emotions other than repugnance and indifference"
rotten,"The failure is in the execution, and as script, direction and even make-up are abysmal, it is very difficult to believe a moment of Saw."
fresh,"James Wan's twistily clever, perversely die-dactic psychothriller affirms life's value even as it sends all hope down the drain."
rotten,Saw simply doesn't cut it.
rotten,So over the top that even the recruited audience of non-critics at my screening began to howl.
fresh,"A twisted, squirm-inducingly nasty bit of work."
rotten,A strenuously morbid assembly of deranged-genius- serial-killer movie conventions cribbed from just about every popular post-Hannibal Lecter movie imaginable.
rotten,
rotten,"A gratuitous, if often successfully creepy exercise in sadomasochistic filmmaking, Saw features some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a mainstream film with an experienced cast."
rotten,"The Internet film geeks are salivating over this one. But humans who live above ground, including horror fans, will find themselves only fitfully entertained and more consistently appalled."
fresh,"An ingenious machine for inducing terror, rage, and paralyzing unease."
fresh,"A sick, twisted, deliriously entertaining horror thriller that rivals The Texas Chainsaw Massacre for sheer, relentless intensity."
fresh,Terrifying at some moments and insinuatingly creepy at many others.
rotten,"A bloody, repugnant world that will offend all but hard-core horror fans."
rotten,"A derivative combination of Seven and Fear Factor, and a work of cynical corporate-style branding posing as independent hustle."
fresh,"Neither a deep, psychological thriller nor a mindless slasher flick, this is one skillfully made, if admittedly superficial, creepout."
rotten,What makes Saw so awful is that it starts with a clever premise and then completely blows it.
fresh,"Saw is a lesson in the redemptive power of a clever ending, how five minutes of inspiration can compensate for an hour and a half of mediocrity."
rotten,"There are a few cheap thrills, but not enough to make sitting through the senseless plot even remotely worthwhile."
rotten,A gore movie with no teeth.
rotten,"Where Seven seemed to radiate diabolical evil, Saw just radiates idiocy."
rotten,"Some have suggested that this is an intentional genre parody, but it's really the same old saw with uglier teeth."
fresh,"For most of its running time, Saw is a cleverly mounted brain teaser that relies less on gore than on mystery and growing panic."
rotten,"Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Cube, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, XXX and Session Nine all played with similar themes and did so infinitely better."
fresh,"Wan and Whannell layer their sicko spectacle with the trappings of traditional horror, yet each convention is twisted just enough to give it a ragged razor edge."
rotten,Its hellish extremes more oppressive than entertaining.
rotten,"Movies like this exist only so filmmakers can mess with the viewer's mind, and moviegoers who allow it engage in tawdry masochism."
rotten,The film is so convoluted and full of garbled loose ends you can feel the different script drafts battling it out for attention on screen.
fresh,"Horrible acting aside, it's the kind of Halloween treat that'll have you checking your backseat after leaving the theater."
rotten,Just another grisly puzzle with no agenda except to convince us that hell would look pretty good after spending almost two hours in this hole.
rotten,"At once, the director is doing too much visually while not doing enough dramatically."
rotten,Brilliant performances by all involved are about the only things that remain consistent.
fresh,Tucci creates a quietly masterful portrayal.
rotten,"I was drawn to the film because of Peter Jackson's involvement, but the creativity of the imagery did not astound me."
rotten,"The emotional core of The Lovely Bones should be closer to Heavenly Creatures, but Jackson has sacrificed feeling for effect."
rotten,Like Jackson missed the target completely and instead hit the cat standing 30 feet away from it.
rotten,"Despite all its promise, the film left me cold. I just never completely bought into the experience, which seemed to be calculated and lacking the heart and depth it so desperately wants to convey."
fresh,Both [Saoirse] Ronan and [Stanley] Tucci are worth the price of an admission ticket.
fresh,"Director Peter Jackson's brilliant ability to bring fantasy to film may have been his Achilles heel here, as he dwells with signature fondness on Susie's journey to heaven. I will say, however, that the acting is spectacular."
rotten,The desire for showmanship gets in the way of characterization and plot.
fresh,"Stick with this devastating, yet curiously uplifting drama as best you can, for the emotional pay-off cannot be denied."
fresh,"Most will hopefully see that in this very creative, authoritative film Peter Jackson preserves the characters, the theme, the dread, the delight found in the novel - and has added just enough of his own."
fresh,"It's an interesting way to tell a heartbreaking story a young girl whose life was taken away too soon, and whose family fights to pull the pieces together after their loss."

fresh,"The Lovely Bones is probably a much better idea for a book than it is a movie, but it's still a very good one, and those don't come along too often."
rotten,"The talented cast struggles with, and is eventually failed by, the material. They are not aided by their director either, who seemingly stood slightly off screen and urged them to 'act bigger!'"
fresh,I had a few bones to pick with the story.
rotten,"The film is such a misfire, such a disappointing collection of failed attempts at emotional affect and confounding storytelling choices, that it seems more like a bad director's attempt to rip off Jackson's style than his own work."
rotten,"No hay manera de tomarse en serio, al menos no en el marco de una película que debió ser perturbadora y conmovedora en partes iguales, la serie de momentos Kodak imposibles con que Peter Jackson intenta retratar la vida después de la muerte."

rotten,Peter Jackson nails the dreamy atmosphere of a film straddling life and death in this story of a teenager caught between Earth and heaven.
rotten,"Peter Jackson is an infant sitting at the grown-ups table, and this proves once and for all he has no business making movies for adults."
fresh,...an admittedly uneven yet utterly engaging piece of work that outshines its literary predecessor in every way...
rotten,"The script races off in three directions. ... These elements may have intertwined more elegantly in Sebold's writing, but on film they rub against each other awkwardly."
rotten,"Uma experiência entediante cujos personagens, supostamente humanos, jamais chegam a exibir um milésimo da complexidade e do apelo dos hobbits, elfos e gorilas gigantes presentes nos filmes anteriores de seu antes infalível diretor."
fresh,"The Lovely Bones does a fantastic job with revered, complex source material. As terrific on terra firma as it is audacious in its astral plane, it is doubtful we'll see a more imaginative, courageous film in 2010."
rotten,"Under the hammy direction of Peter Jackson The Lovely Bones has lost its poetic bone structure. What was a complex, quirky novel has been turned into a movie mishmash of Lord of the Rings and High School Musical, with a serial killer thrown in."
rotten,"Instead of a compelling nightmare, he has created a bland, girly-sparkly dream."
rotten,"The delicacy and finely-wrought characterisation of Alice Sebold's novel has been removed in favour of a beyond-the-grave whodunit, subtlety be damned."
rotten,Jackson's candy-coloured fantasias - reminiscent of 1970s concept-album artwork - are no substitute for actual drama. There's nothing at stake.
rotten,"Themes are blurred, character motivations largely unclear and the novel's central justification, and subsequent pay off, are hugely disappointing."
rotten,"Jackson seems more at home in the afterlife than in this one, rendering this off-kilter project creepy and pretentious."
rotten,"The finale - though tense - lacks that visceral gut punch. Ultimately, Jackson spends too long in the clouds and loses touch with the real drama on ground level."
rotten,"The Lovely Bones marks a new low in cinematic adaptations. Back in 1989, Peter Jackson made a trashy horror film called Bad Taste. Even that was in better taste than this banal monstrosity."
rotten,"No bones about it, Jackson looks like he's spent so long in front of a computer he's forgotten how to tell a story."
rotten,Jackson's DayGlo CGI vision of the afterlife tries to strangle a terrific crime thriller - and pretty much does.
rotten,"Jackson's version achieves a different, less palatable kind of novelty. It is a ""heart-warming"" film about murder."
rotten,"It is the kind of film that falls over itself trying to dazzle us, and makes an unholy mess of the vital workaday stuff. It is silly, tedious, tasteless and utterly false."
fresh,A beautifully made but often uneven film with a luminous central role from Ronan.
rotten,"The most remarkable aspect of this is how rubbish the CGI effects are -I mean, this is Peter Jackson, for goodness' sake!"
rotten,"The imagery kills the fear. In a film which is essentially about a child serial killer, the constant blossoming of visual possibility leaves the reality of what happened to Susie both hidden and cold."
rotten,It's completely overwrought. Every single moment in the film is an emotional climax of some kind. At no point is there any kind of middle ground.
rotten,Jackson takes a bloated approach to what should be a quietly emotional drama.
rotten,You wanna know what purgatory feels like? Sit through all two-plus hours of this lurid mush and you'll have a fair idea.
rotten,"Although Ronan and Tucci offer up beautifully nuanced performances, it's still not enough to stop The Lovely Bones from floundering about. Unfocused and often gaudy its most certainly not as lovely as it wants to be."
rotten,"Too often, though, it feels like another unwanted M Night Shyamalan movie, with Wahlberg again looking stunned, as if he still can't believe he starred in The Happening."
rotten,"The main problem with the film is the extremely bloated script, which slows to a crawl immediately after the murder and then meanders all over the place."
fresh,"An entertaining but strange hybrid -- part murder mystery, part gooey teen romance/coming of age story, part philosophy lesson, part family drama"
fresh,"very much a film of mood where emotions run deep and devastating, and those emotions are the most potent special effect in a work that is sometimes a bit top heavy with them"
rotten,"Alice Sebold's evocative best seller proves to be more unfilmable than Tolkien's sprawling fantasy trilogy - a disappointment, yet it's impossible for anyone to do it better"
rotten,Despite its visually remarkable attempts to engage the film is an utter loss.
rotten,"""Somehow the depth of the novel has become nothing more than an exercise in producing a polished, beautiful-looking fantasy."""
rotten,"The sum of the parts of this film while tantalizing and worth a watch, leave the viewer, like its lead character, lacking closure."
rotten,The story is just told very poorly... what is this movie? A thriller? A ghost story? A police procedural? A tearjerker? It's all of those and none of them.
rotten,"The Lovely Bones demeure un film aux idées intrigantes et aux intentions fort honorables, mais dont l'exécution s'avère trop souvent déficiente."
fresh,"Thematically muddled, the film nevertheless has a strong sense of visual presence and features a handful of strong performances."
fresh,Learning to live beyond grief is the heart of the story and the performances bring out that premise beautifully.
rotten,An okay movie hampered by Wahlberg's sleepy performance and Sarnadon's visit from another planet
rotten,It is hard to know what Jackson was intending to do with this film. Instead of telling the earth-story he seems to have wanted to give us some indelible images of heaven
rotten,"The cast is determined to do something with the material, but given the way Jackson shields them with effects, they can only do so much."
rotten,"[The film] remains a mystery -- not a mystery as in who committed the crime, but a mystery in its intended theme and why that theme didn't unite the film at all."
rotten,It's a great deal of effort by a lot of talented people that results in two-plus hours of tepid clockwork blandness.
rotten,"while it has moments that soar both visually and emotionally, it ultimately feels torn and unwieldy"
rotten,The cinematic equivalent of that big farm your childhood dog allegedly went to.
fresh,Lush cinematography combined with first-rate acting and a valuable story make this a great film for the whole family.
rotten,"... often visually striking but emotionally baffling, and ultimately seems stuck in the same sort of purgatory as its young heroine."
rotten,"Jackson and his usual screenwriting collaborators...have simplified and amplified Sebold's text, turning it from a meditation on the interior politics of family into a supernatural revenge story."
fresh,"Because Peter Jackson is willing to wrestle with challenging material, it's easy to forgive him if he doesn't create additional masterpieces every time he steps behind the camera."
rotten,"Acting laurels belong to Tucci as the unrepentant killer. He shows chameleon-like qualities with wild personality shifts. Ronan makes good use of her large, expressive eyes. It is only a matter of time before she becomes a big star in Hollywood. McIver is"
fresh,"Peter Jackson is anything but a good fit to direct this story, as his well-intentioned efforts at conveying transcendence sometimes look and feel phony."
fresh,"Moviegoers who haven't read the book and accept the picture on its own terms (which, ultimately, is how any artistic interpretation should be judged) will be greeted with a powerful viewing experience."
fresh,"The first 45 minutes are great. The last 30 minutes are also great. The problem is the 45 minutes in the middle, which are bogged down with unnecessary visual effects."
rotten,"A muted tragedy about a murdered girl who watches her family and killer from a place between heaven and Earth, The Lovely Bones remains oddly remote."
rotten,"""The Lovely Bones"" is a skeleton of a movie, lacking any sense of life and vitality."
fresh,"Ultimately, The Lovely Bones works best when Ronan simply reads Sebold's simple yet evocative prose."
fresh,"Taken on its own, it's a mixed bag of grief and visual magic tricks that provides pleasant enough passive viewing, but doesn't do the greatest job of putting flesh on its characters' bones."
fresh,"It might take you a while to see it, and maybe more than one viewing, but in the end, The Lovely Bones becomes a heartbreaking, harrowing expression of love and loss"
rotten,"Some books should stay between their covers, and The Lovely Bones may well be one of them."
fresh,"Succeeds as a taut, ""will-he-get-caught"" mystery as it also explores the notion of acceptance following the loss of a loved one."
rotten,"When I read Peter Jackson was handling the story, I figured if anyone could do it, he could. I was wrong."
fresh,"A chilling performance by Tucci, whose versatility is more evident with every film he makes, and an eerie portrayal by young Ronan."
rotten,...the movie veers off into whimsical imagery entirely incongruous with the tone of every other scene.
fresh,"Understand, the film still has power, just not as much as it should."
fresh,The movie is often wise.
fresh,"This is a distractingly busy movie, so in love with its own considerable craft that it can't stay still long enough for anything to settle in."
rotten,Performances become almost inconsequential when the roles are so superficial.
rotten,"A story about the unbreakable bonds between parents and children, a story about thwarted justice and monstrous revelations is diverted by Jackson into a story about the CGI wow factor of his netherworld."
rotten,"It's like they tried to accomplish everything, but ended up forgetting to have a purpose."
fresh,"While the film contains storytelling issues and an inconsistent tone, the intensity of Stanley Tucci's character blew me away. The film is visually stunning and worth seeing."
rotten,"A movie with tons of possibilities, 3 or 4 awesome scenes, some great tension, and lots of filler."
rotten,At once both one of the most conceptually daring films of 2009 and one of its biggest train wrecks.
rotten,"The locale is Pennsylvania, but Jackson seems reluctant to leave Middle-earth and Skull Island behind. He guides us through tediously inventive CG heavenly landscapes, when what we really want is more of the mundane interior of the killer's suburban home."
fresh,"The new Peter Jackson movie, ""The Lovely Bones,"" is a head trip for audiences, a trip to hell for the family featured, and a plunge into purgatory for another."
rotten,It's a mark of Jackson's lack of restraint as a filmmaker that the mystery-thriller elements and fantastic visualizations overtake the domestic drama that is the novel's true raison d'être.
rotten,"Susie's concerned that that the penguin trapped in the snow globe is all alone. The toy's OK, but the multiple souls scattered throughout the film are having a hell of a time surviving in their respective prisons."
rotten,It's difficult to understand how Jackson could have gone so far wrong with his conception of the material.
rotten,"Jackson's grand, computer-generated vision of Susie's Dali-like ""in between,"" while occasionally gorgeous, leaves the viewer feeling stuck between two worlds, too. The story suffers."
rotten,"Most often, Jackson's magical other world resembles the land of Oz on steroids or, in one scene, a feminine hygiene ad."
rotten,"Tone is the first thing sacrificed in this shapeless, overlong, mawkishly muddled pop-up illustration of a movie."
fresh,"Who would think that a movie about the murder of a 14-year-old girl would be, at times, beautiful and comforting?"
rotten,"Jackson's efforts to translate the graceful, lucid prose into images loses all of the story's delicacy and becomes cloying and dissonant."
rotten,Parental Content Review
rotten,"Every time things begin to pick up steam Jackson suddenly slows them to an absolute halt, intricately crafted momentum unhappily destroyed in little less than the flash of instant."
rotten,An astonishingly tone-deaf work that is one of the most utterly misguided literary adaptations to hit the big screen in recent memory.
rotten,"Following a devastatingly beautiful first act, the film goes downhill in unfathomably fatal ways. The Lovely Bones is a startling mess of near-epic proportions, one of 2009's very biggest disappointments."
fresh,...the best film of 2009...
rotten,"The Lovely Bones is difficult viewing, a meticulously crafted experiment that, it turns out, wasn't worth it."
fresh,"The biggest surprise of 2021 for me… none of the trailers really grabbed my attention but damn does the movie work. With its charm, great humor, & excellent chase sequences that add some amazing adrenaline ! Give me more of The Rock, Gal, & Ryan!!"
rotten,"If you want some substance to your fun that calls to memory Spielberg’s Indiana Jones films or even the weaker, but still engaging, National Treasure movies, then this isn’t your movie."
fresh,Red Notice is an enjoyable action diversion.
rotten,Red Notice is one of those absurd Abbas-Mustan-style campfests with so many random twists and double-crosses that only great actors or terrible actors can pull them off.
fresh,Efficiently kills a couple of hours without stealing our hearts.
rotten,"Red Notice is vastly less than the sum of its parts, with the central trio saving it from mediocrity. It's a perfectly acceptable and decently entertaining 200 million action epic, but nothing more."
rotten,"The most expensive and successful Netflix original film yet, watching Red Notice is like watching the feature-length version of a fake movie inside another movie; its cliched, over-the-top, and plays out like a parody of itself."
fresh,"This blatantly silly movie is the absolute best possible version of itself  it's funny, has some exciting chase scenes, and is altogether the Platonic ideal of a 7/10 movie."
rotten,"The cheesy elements combined with the flat characters, that were brought to life by extraordinary talent, left Red Notice struggling from the very start."
rotten,"Theres a cold, almost algorithmic quality to the film and its performances, to the extent that calling Red Notice an original conceit feels disingenuous."
fresh,"it is definitely entertaining and hits a few high notes here and there, especially when Reynolds's banter runs headlong into Dwayne Johnson's straight-man stoicism"
fresh,"Red Notice delivers on its promise; good action, charm, absurd journey. A film worth watching for a goofy good time."
rotten,"As mindless entertainment built on silly jokes, a thin plot, visual effects and window dressing, Red Notice is a 117-minute distraction, easily forgotten in half that time."
rotten,"Red Notice is proof that one can hire the best talent and put them in a room, but the effort amounts to wasted potential without a good script or strong direction."
rotten,"...a relentlessly slick endeavor that's rarely, if ever, as engrossing or exciting as one might've anticipated..."
fresh,"Escapist fun is rarely smart and doesn't carry much depth, but the nice thing here is that the humor outweighs the mindless action."
rotten,"I also have already forgotten it, and I bet you do, too, ten minutes after seeing it."
fresh,"Rawson Marshall Thurber's clever script is a shell game of plot twists and head fakes which keeps daring you to notice, or care, that you're watching a scam, a forgery and a fiction. It"
fresh,Perfectly cast and perfectly balanced between comedy and thrills. Sign me up for the sequel.
rotten,"After about 30 minutes of this overblown, under-baked product, I decided that life's too short and hit the off button."
fresh,"Red Notice appears to have all the right ingredients for a franchise-ready adventure, yet something's notably off when the pieces are mixed together, which makes it a real downer."
fresh,I watched this 117-minute movie on a rainy afternoon and it was just about perfect for the time and place. The final scene suggests a sequel. I hope it happens.
rotten,"Three of my very favorite actors in the business. And by the end of this, I hated all three...the plot is lazier than their performances..."
rotten,"Frequently feels like three distinct ""brands"" being brought together, rather than three actors falling in love with a script."
rotten,"Gadot seems to be having the most fun here, letting out the evil side that we never see her display as Wonder Woman. But even with her wrapping a sensuous leg around Johnson on a dance floor, there's no chemistry on view."
rotten,The three stars -- and the audience -- deserve better.
fresh,"The three leads have chemistry to burn, but even that fails to justify the somewhat presumptuous ending suggesting a sequel."
rotten,What should have been a guaranteed hit turns out to be a disposable dud.
fresh,Everyone knows [the film is] all about having a good time. For someone to remember what happened during that time may still be asking a lot. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"A movie with three major movie stars, which is utterly forgettable in just about every way."
fresh,"A high gag quotient (mostly curse-free, thankfully) and zippy pacing from writer/director Rawson Marshall Thurber mark Red Notice as a pleasing assembly-line time killer that upshifts when the action kicks in and the camera takes on a life of its own."
rotten,"It's fun for a while, but goes on too long for its own good."
rotten,Only undemanding fans will enjoy this hyper-twisting romp and return for the sequel that's set up at the end.
rotten,"In terms of authenticity, ""Red Notice"" isn't even a passable fake."
rotten,"Generic in every way, Red Notice isn't a film you want to give notice to."
fresh,"Red Notice has never pitched itself as anything other than a fun treasure hunt put together by pals. It's an easy, non-taxing watch. It isn't particularly memorable though."
fresh,"A slick, entertaining action comedy romp that's definitely worth checking out. The Johnson-Gadot-Reynolds trio is awesome. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"One senses that instead of a script, the filmmakers worked off a binder containing reams of Netflix data and instead of storyboards there were pie charts."
rotten,"Not quite the success Netflix would have been banking on even if it isn't entirely awful. It isn't far off though, and it can thank its lead trio for barely keeping it afloat."
fresh,"Largely works because of the charisma of its stars, not because of their acting. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,[Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson] seems caught up in these projects for the whole family... that are as anabolic as they are aimless. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,Only benefits slightly from Reynold's ingenious humor. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"[H]its all the notes of an action blockbuster, but each note rings just a bit false. And as those false notes pile up, things get cacophonous...Red Notice might be a heist movie, but in the end, the most valuable thing stolen might be your time."
rotten,"Red Notice is entertaining enough, thanks to its leads, but there is no originality. Not particularly kid friendly for the younger crowd due to sexual innuendos."
rotten,"Red Notice is uninspired, uninteresting, and unforgivably bland. Its only redeeming quality is its stars and, even then, their talents are underutilized"
rotten,"The mere idea of our biggest movie stars using their hard-earned clout to push boundaries seems like something that would get you slapped for uttering in a Hollywood agency these days. To experience that sensation, all you need to do is watch Red Notice."
rotten,"Say what you will about Red Notice - a chemistry-free, egocentric, poorly written, cartoonishly dull, CG backdrop-filled flick - but it's currently on Netflix."
rotten,A nondescript action movie. [Full review in Spanish]
rotten,"A lifeless, impersonal movie with three great stars at their most lifeless and impersonal"
rotten,A-list Hollywood stars have zero chemistry in an utterly tiresome and contrived heist flick. Red Notice ends up looking like nothing more than flashy costume jewelry.
rotten,"Red Notice lacks depth when it comes to the story, but still an enjoyable movie for the stellar cast alone."
rotten,"Despite its ostentatious budget, or perhaps precisely because of it, Red Notice is a film that takes all the easy paths. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"I don't expect every movie to be award-worthy, but even 'brainless' movies ought to still offer some kind of entertainment value. Red Notice is such an exorbitant waste of talents and resources."
rotten,Tepid and tedious - it's a total waste of time and talent.
fresh,"It's funny, action-packed, and fun, which is exactly as it should be."
fresh,"Sometimes one just wants escapism. If so, do I have a film for you."
rotten,"It's the kind of forgettable, cookie-cutter comic adventure likely to be viewed with half-a-smile and half-a-grimace throughout its entire runtime."
rotten,"There's turn off your brain and enjoy movies, and then there's this."
rotten,"What's fascinating about Red Notice is that it's a film that thinks that just by tossing these three megastars into situations together, magic will result."
rotten,...this Nazi memorabilia frolic through meaningless landscapes spanning different continents seems as frivolous as Netflix's bigger films have ever been.
rotten,"If the director and actors don't seem engaged in trying to make a movie that does anything but hit a bunch of buddy comedy marks, there's no reason for an audience to bother."
rotten,"...it's not that Red Notice is done badly, it's just so vanilla that it leaves no taste whatsoever..."
rotten,"There's no personality here, no unique traits or artistry that would make it the least bit interesting. It's the equivalent of cotton candy."
rotten,"""Red Notice"" should pass without much notice."
fresh,"Every single complaint you're gonna have is absolutely 100% true. But I had a fun time. In this day and age, it's nice to just be able to watch a movie and enjoy it."
rotten,"Red Notice is limp and dull, and does more to showcase the shortcomings of each of its marquee idols than it does to highlight their bankable charisma."
rotten,The problem is that this movie is built on nothing but making references to [its influences].
fresh,I liked it in spite of myself... The chemistry between these stars is amazing.
rotten,"Witless, lifeless, shameless, hopeless, useless - pointless."
fresh,"It's not called Red Notice (Taylor's Version), all descriptive and emotional and important. Red Notice needs few words: Action good. Lines funny. Movie fun enough."
rotten,"[A] witless, bombastic stab at a globe-trotting comic adventure...which-appropriately, given its MacGuffins-lays one huge egg."
fresh,"Reynolds does his silky-voiced sarcasm thing, Johnson counters with bullet-headed seriousness, and Gadot sidles between them, charming and dangerous. They look like they're having a blast."
fresh,"I love me a solid throwback, and for me, I was like, ""Whoa, it's like 1999 all over again!"""
rotten,"I just wish I could cite a single moment that made me laugh out loud, or surprised me, or got my heart racing the way any of the movies Red Notice has digested..."
rotten,"Like the plot of the film itself, none of the many bullets that whizz around ever seem to find their targets."
fresh,Red Notice looks slick and boasts attractive A-list actors pulling fantastic stunts in gorgeous locations around the globe. It will find its audience.
fresh,"The film ends up coming off like tasty comfort food in that you know what you're getting, it all goes down easily, and you'll likely feel satisfied after consuming it."
fresh,"Ocean's Eleven meets National Treasure. Not one of my favorite movies of the year, but I enjoyed it."
fresh,"Do you know how little a movie has to do to succeed with [this] cast and premise? If they just stood around quipping for two hours, I'd still give it a positive rating."
rotten,It's one of the most insufferable and empty things you could ever hope to avoid.
rotten,"The Red Notice cocktail of Johnson, Gadot and Reynolds may look delicious from a distance, but an ounce of originality is the missing ingredient that might have made it go down a bit smoother."
rotten,"The utterly lifeless, disposable, and bland, ""Red Notice"" doesn't feature a lot of personality and hardly registers a pulse."
rotten,"Destined to be the most-watched, least-remembered film of our age."
rotten,"Overall, Red Notice is pretty much a forgettable big-budget Netflix film."
rotten,"Action movies are supposed to be fun, but Red Notice delivers nothing but overwhelming disappointment at every turn."
rotten,"Everything that can be seen as what's wrong with Netflix's original films can be found in Red Notice, an awful adventure movie."
fresh,"This is the potential straight A student settling for Bs simply because it requires less work. It still gets the job done, but the payoff could be even greater."
rotten,Red Notice is not a movie. It is a $200 million existential crisis in light.
rotten,"For Netflix, it's all about the number of subscribers they can pull in, with the combined might of Deadpool, The Rock, and Wonder Woman. Red Notice is a criminal waste of money and everyone's time-except those who got paid $20 million."
rotten,"The two-hour runtime feels almost short for a big-budget blockbuster, but that doesn't mean that it's time well spent."
fresh,"It's ok for what it is, perfect for spending a couple of hours watching these three doing what we like to see them doing, without expecting more than that. [Review in Spanish]"
rotten,"Only Gadot has enough star quality to make Red Notice sparkle for a few moments, but to be honest, had I not been reviewing the film, I would have flicked it off long before she made her first entrance."
fresh,"Red Notice is carried solely through star power, as our three leads deliver on some great banter. The film fun enough."
rotten,"An action crime caper with barely an original bone in its body, Red Notice is made palatable, even watchable, by the easy charm of its stars."
rotten,Red Notice is potentially one of the most formulaic and bland - yet surprisingly fun - action-comedies Netflix has churned out yet
fresh,"A classic of either the heist or action-comedy genre it is not, but, it works as a forgettable, unchallenging watch."
fresh,"To describe Red Notice as a whole lot of nothing could be understood as praise, up to a point. By design, there are no ideas worth mentioning in Rawson Michael Thurber's strenuously breezy caper."
rotten,It's a derivative flick that relies too much on Reynolds' incessant barrage of sarcastic one-liners to keep the audience entertained.
rotten,"There's something incredibly deflating about all of this, from the waste of precious screen-talent resources to the sense that you're watching the last gasp of an age-old formula. It is like staring at a bright, shiny epitaph for two hours."
rotten,"When the story winks at Raiders of the Lost Ark, the effect is to remind you of other, older spectaculars made in better faith."
rotten,"Uninterested in world building or creating any sense of stakes, ""Red Notice"" is merely an expensive brandishing of star power - only the stars haven't got it in them."
rotten,"You can have The Rock, Wonder Woman, and Deadpool, but it doesn't mean much if they don't have clever things to say and meaningful things to do."
fresh,"The trio brings just enough charm and good times to the story to make it a check your brain at the door old fashioned fun and that's why I gave Red Notice three stars, one star each for each of its stars, Reynolds, Gadot and Johnson."
rotten,"Turn off your brain, and you might have at least some fun with Red Notice. However, this brawny, bloated blockbuster is too short on new ideas and wastes its A-List cast for a cookie-cutter action flick that makes your Netflix subscription feel criminal."
rotten,"It's all too appropriate that Netflix's biggest blockbuster to date offers mediocre pleasures that feel wholly algorithm-driven. It's never less than watchable, but shoots so broadly for every conceivable demographic as to shirk creativity entirely."
rotten,"Red Notice skims by without trying anything new. Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot have all made better films showcasing each of their strengths if that's what you're in the mood for."
rotten,"Johnson is one of the few stars who actually gets expensive, original action films made, but of late he's tended toward disappointingly safe material. Red Notice is his most generic effort yet."
fresh,"The cinematic equivalent of driving with your window rolled down while chugging a Red Bull, it's worth bumping all the way to the top of your queue."
rotten,"While Ryan Reynolds is doing everything he can to keep us paying attention, Dwayne Johnson has never been more late-stage Bruce Willis in a film that plunks together scenes with all the verve of an SNL bulletin board announcing the next show."
rotten,"I gave Red Notice my full attention, and all it gave me back was a headache. As far as I'm concerned that says it all."
fresh,A lot of fun! Dwayne Johnson & Ryan Reynolds are a great team. The movie is very fun and energetic. One of Netflix's best films.
fresh,Enjoy Red Notice as pure eye-candy entertainment but don't expect any more than that.
rotten,"Reportedly the most expensive Netflix original production to date, Red Notice would have benefited if some of its $200m budget had been spent on untangling the screenplay."
rotten,A non-sensical and dull but glossy heist action/comedy.
fresh,"Its characters may be cookie-cutter, but the charisma of Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot oozes off the screen..."
rotten,"When you hit that wall in the third act, it's not just ginger pop Ed Sheeran staring back you. It's ""resting failure face."""
rotten,"Red Notice may be the biggest movie Netflix has ever backed, but its blockbuster budgets and intense action sequences can't cover the lack of chemistry between its stars or the influence of other films on its screenplay."
fresh,"Red Notice doesn't quite coalesce into something that could become a timeless classic of its own, but it provides plenty of entertainment."
fresh,"What makes Red Notice stand out, as a heist tale, is Reynolds' comic touch that injects new life into what could've been just another dull by-the-books Netflix original."
rotten,"Pretty standard jet setting heist mixed with action movies, but Red Notice is often lacking in charisma, big action set pieces, and genuine fun."
rotten,"With so many past lives to choose from, the filmmakers of Infinite still repeated the same mistakes when there should have been limitless possibilities. Instead, it’s an endless exercise in suspense-free filmmaking."
fresh,"Infinite is at times comedically convoluted, but thanks to brilliant world-building and stellar action setpieces, it’s riotously entertaining regardless."
rotten,Perhaps the movie’s biggest shortcoming is that it spends a lot of time talking about relationships from the past rather than building any meaningful new ones on screen.
fresh,"""Infinite"" has all the elements you'd find in almost any action film. It just slightly misses the mark by not going all in and fully immersing the viewer in its reincarnation concept."
rotten,One of those grueling efforts that renders the science fiction genre about as much fun as a root canal sans anesthetics.
rotten,"The writing is so haphazard and choppy, and it leapfrogs over what needs to be explained... you don't have any emotional investment."
rotten,"Brainless. The only skills the reincarnated team of assassins retain are fighting skills, leaving any provocative questions about transmigration unaddressed and any interesting ideas unexplored."
rotten,What follows is a ploddingly predictable slog through a confusing combination of sci-fi cliches and vaguely mystical mambo-jumbo that basically strings out a series of mindless pyrotechnic set-pieces.
rotten,"If you ever wondered what The Matrix would have been like if the lead was played by a fifty year old who was also kind of like Jason Bourne, here's your chance."
fresh,"If it's empty-vessel escapism you're after, this wonkily watchable affair will deliver what little you need."
rotten,"The visuals are spectacular, but things get increasingly derivative as they progress, and Jason Mantzoukas' ill-conceived comic-relief character falls clangingly flat."
rotten,"If you understand any of it, please enlighten me, because I am in the dark."
rotten,"The bad guys in Mark Wahlberg's reincarnation-themed action movie want to destroy the world so they never have to relive it all again. Having seen the film, I know the feeling"
rotten,"Given the bona fides of everyone involved, it seemed reasonable to expect an entertaining adventure -- and at worst, dumb fun -- but the final product underwhelms at even the low end of expectations."
rotten,...it unfurls more like an M. Night Shyamalan sci-fi misfire...
rotten,"This action film about reincarnation tries to relive the plot beats of countless better films. The end result is a derivative, messy and forgettable film."
fresh,"Infinite boasts a high-concept story and extremely inventive action sequences, though Mark Wahlberg's performance leaves much to be desired."
rotten,"Playing around with the concept of reincarnation is certainly promising, but Infinite makes the plot absurd for no reason. [Full review in Spanish]"
rotten,"I'll give points for finely crafted action sequences and a handful of bold casting choices, but beyond that, Infinite is decidedly, whole-heartedly average."
rotten,"It's exactly the kind of big, silly, occasionally exciting spectacle that have come to define summer movie season, for better or worse. There's even an opening for a sequel."
rotten,"Woefully miscast, too derivative and not nearly exciting enough to overcome its fundamental blandness."
rotten,"This is a lot like the multiple-dimension thing of Jet Li's The One, in which...oh, never mind, it hardly matters, because to present Mark Wahlberg as the repository of Eastern thought makes me want to scream."
rotten,"""Infinite"" is overcluttered with special effects and plagued by wooden acting and doesn't have one genuine character in it."
rotten,"I don't want to leave the impression ""Infinite"" is bad because in actuality, it's purely awful, a dopey actionioner filled with wonky science, inane dialogue and a plot so laughable it leaves you in hysterics."
fresh,"Even though it fumbles a fascinating premise, I kind of liked Infinite. You've seen pieces of this movie before, it doesn't go particularly deep, but it kept me interested nevertheless."
rotten,"All the visual flourishes can't raise the narrative stakes of a movie rooted more in formula than character development or emotional payoff. By the end, you'll want to erase the memory of having watched it."
rotten,The pace of all the action gets tripped up by a convoluted plot that Infinite tangles instead of unfurls.
rotten,"Frankly, it's a pity that there are infinite possibilities (no pun intended) that [Antoine] Fuqua can choose to explore in his latest film, given its reincarnation theme."
rotten,The premise of reincarnation and star power can't save this film from its sci -fi abyss
rotten,"Perhaps no director could breathe life into a film with such an absolutely dire script, and with such a sloppily superficial sense of its own worldbuilding and interior mythology."
fresh,"Maybe ""Infinite"" isn't crazy, it's just misunderstood."
rotten,"Occasionally explosive, but rarely coherent."
rotten,"Welcome to a movie that makes absolutely zero sense and didn't need to exist. From the acting to the story to the direction, there's nothing redeemable here."
rotten,Saying that schizophrenia is just midiagnosed past life recall is not great.
rotten,"Stuck with an incomprehensible, half-baked idea and carried out with stale writing, mechanical acting, and relentless chase scenes and explosions, this sci-fi action movie is an almost total failure."
rotten,Knee-jerk clichés abound in a shameless retread of The Matrix in which many levels of storytelling ineptitude are the only depth on offer. Can Hollywood please stop reincarnating the same old movies?
rotten,"Things get more ludicrous as they unfold, but never to the point of being goofy fun."
rotten,"Fuqua does what he can to sprinkle garnishing on cold leftovers, but the script barely holds together, and seems to emanate from an alternate reality where no other sci-fi films or games were released in the last 25 years."
rotten,High octane action can't save this messy would-be franchise starter
rotten,"We desperately need more original, high concept action films, and kudos to Fuqua for attempting, but the script needed to go through a few different lifetimes before being ready for production."
rotten,"A particularly pathetic example of big-budget sci-fi folderol, a woebegone attempt at a CGI-heavy action thriller that leaves egg on everyone's face."
rotten,"A lazy, could've-been-inventive affair that lacks any charm to compensate for the by-the-numbers material."
rotten,"Viewed at home, from the perspective of the couch, the effects are smaller, the holes in the story bigger, the acting infinitely more ridiculous."
rotten,A hodgepodge of ideas better executed elsewhere and dragged down by an uninterested lead actor.
rotten,It keeps stalling out even when it switches transportation modes.
rotten,Mostly... Infinite feels like a depressing fable about the movie industry.
rotten,Feels like Hollywood took another crack at bringing Assassins' Creed to life but somehow worse
fresh,"While the film had an interesting premise, a strong cast and a seasoned director, the plot was difficult to follow which confused me quite a bit."
rotten,Infinite has an intriguing set-up that's fumbled by a poorly written script. Dylan O'Brien and Mark Wahlberg needed to reverse roles as the protagonist.
rotten,"It's the worst kind of soulless committee-made product, lazy and risk-free, that need never and will never be thought of again. Infinite? Not even close."
rotten,There just isn't enough here to recommend 'Infinite' as more than background noise for a lazy afternoon.
rotten,"Infinite is an easy watch, but the predictable plot and forgettable script come together to create an unmemorable experience."
rotten,"Paramount+ has finally released its first major in-house exclusive movie, but it's an understatement to say that Infinite could be better."
rotten,Infinite flattens a high-stakes battle of good and evil into airless action of little consequence peopled by characters that amount to even less.
fresh,"""Infinite"" is entertaining, transforming into a YA adventure for adult audiences, with the endeavor working especially hard to build enough momentum for future installments."
rotten,"Rather than crafting a high-concept science-fiction marvel, Fuqua's ""Infinite"" relies on shoddy VFX and ropey world-building for the worst film of his career."
rotten,"Another ""was supposed to be in multiplexes"" streaming premiere that's so bad it qualifies as a mitzvah to movie theaters."
rotten,Remembering one's past lives could only be made much worse by having watched this movie in one of them.
rotten,"Logic isn't the point, and unfortunately, the potential of this premise isn't, either."
fresh,"All things considered, Infinite is the perfect content for Paramount+: big budget theatrics and low stakes drama."
fresh,Mark Wahlberg plays a reincarnated Japanese blacksmith who uses his sword to stab a plane. What else do you need to say?
rotten,"I like Wahlberg just fine, but he is sorely miscast as the lead character."
rotten,"[I]t coalesces as a convoluted and tired ""chosen one"" story that inspires an empty performance from Mark Wahlberg and some world-class scenery chewing from Chiwetel Ejiofor."
rotten,"The more you start to nitpick this movie, the more egregious its plot holes appear, until the whole thing collapses in on itself."
rotten,"There's nothing entertaining about Infinite. It just sits there, lifeless, hoping to become a full-blown franchise with sequels galore."
rotten,"Paramount decided to move it to Paramount+ where this generic, derivative nonsense will probably fit better anyway. It already plays more like something the Netflix algorithm burped up on an off-cycle."
rotten,"Between the stars and the action, ﻿Infinite﻿ has plenty of elements working in its favor, but the overall execution still leaves one wanting."
rotten,"It's tacky product, fully deserving its fate of being dumped to also-ran streaming status."
fresh,"When all is said and done, Infinite is a prime summer blockbuster whose mindlessness and similarities to other science fiction thrillers don't prevent it from being dull or from galvanizing audiences for a follow-up."
rotten,"Wahlberg, who usually has a way with a cynical wisecrack, seems to sprain muscles trying to sell his character's attempts at light-witted banter."
rotten,Runs out of lives.
rotten,Infinite never escapes the tiredness of its by-the-numbers mechanics.
rotten,"""Infinite"" has some impressive set pieces combining practical effects and CGI, and the terrific cast approaches the material with grim-faced sincerity, but it's ultimately a big bag of nonsense wrapped in glossy packaging."
rotten,"What Infinite fatally lacks is personality. It's all sci-fi table setting all the time, racing through introductions and plot points at a mercenary pace, its wheel manned by a star whose default mode for this kind of movie is hunky frowning."
rotten,"""Infinite"" only runs 106 minutes, but you'd do anything not to live through it again."
rotten,"This feels like a paycheck job all around, and Bathurst speaks for everyone when he proclaims that ""Newer is almost never better."""
rotten,"The film plays like an overcomplicated imitator of The Matrix that never pauses long enough to foster interest in a single character. It's busy and bombastic but dull, explosive and assaultive but never exciting..."
rotten,The problem with Antoine Fuqua's spin on the formula is that it's mostly formula and hardly any spin.
fresh,I liked it just enough to like it but not enough to think anybody else will.
fresh,"If Mark Wahlberg's existential narration feels like it's on the verge of selling you something, it is. He's trying to close the deal on how smoothly ""Infinite"" can go down if you surrender to its deeply, incessantly goofy pleasures. And he succeeds."
fresh,"In the comfort of your home,Infiniteis an exciting diversion but hardly the kind of film you'll want to live through again and again."
rotten,Gonzo nonsense that's as watchable as it is forgettable.
rotten,"""Infinite"" hops from set-piece to set-piece, with director Antoine Fuqua - a long way from ""Training Day"" - pushing the action sequences well past the point of credibility and occasionally into hilarity."
