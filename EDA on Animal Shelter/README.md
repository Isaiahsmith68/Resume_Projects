Iâ€™ve always loved animals and my family has adopted from shelters in the past so I found a particular interest in this dataset from the Austin Animal Shelter.
The main purpose of this short analysis is to demonstrate proficiency in pandas.

The data can be found at https://data.austintexas.gov/browse?q=animal

Two datasets were downloaded for my EDA:
    1. Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv
    2. Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv

Each CSV file contains 12 columns. They are as follows:
1. Animal ID - 
Unique ID
2. Name - 
Name of Animal
3. DateTime - 
Date & time of outcome
4. MonthYear - 
Month & year of outcome
5. Date of Birth -
