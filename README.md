  ### Overview of project
  1. Datasets:
     - Movie_dataset_cleaned.csv was the first dataset I collected. It resulted in unbalanced classes so I decided to collect another dataset
     - Movie_Dataset.csv is the second dataset where I tried to balance the classes by collecting more rotten examples. This is the dataset for the ouputs of Parser.ipynb
    
  2. Parser:
     - The parser was built from scratch using a combination of selenium and beautiful soup to deal with a dynamic webpage. The webpage constantly updates so if you were to run it now it would scrape different reviews than at the time I ran it.
    
  3. Model building:
     - Notebook begins by cleaning up and merging the datasets.
     - After, various ML models were built to evaluate the varying performances on our movie dataset.
    

I would love to walk potential recruiters through the project to showcase a proficieny in various machine learning models, tuning methods, and evaluation metrics.
